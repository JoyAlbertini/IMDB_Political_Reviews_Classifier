Not quite #63 bad.,"""Captain America"" (1990) was just added to IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List....the one hundred worst rated major release films of all time. This is unusual, as this film did not (until now) have enough votes to make it elegible to join the ranks of awfulness. However, with the release of the latest Captain America film (""Avengers: Endgame""), apparently increased attention has been on this poor movie...hence it's inclusion. However, there is one huge problem with this....while ""Captain America"" is clearly a bad film, it is ridiculous to consider it's among the 100 worst ever. I wouldn't even place it in the bottom 1000....let alone 100.

The first portion of the movie is actually pretty good. You get the creation of the Captain as well as Red Skull....and up until Captain goes into suspended animation in the ice of Alaska, I thought I'd probably give the film a 4 or 5...maybe even a 6. But the final portion was just terrible. First, the Captain was saddled with a stupid sidekick who looked like an extra from the film ""Valley Girl"". She was weak and silly...and totally out of place. Second, the climactic final battle was terrible. If Captain America is a superhero....why was he so wimpy...not only in the final battle but all the ones leading up to it?! Third, while he tried hard, Matt Salinger was a dull Captain America...very dull. Add to this, fourth, a weak script with weak dialog. Overall, one of the worst superhero films I've seen...but nothing like truly godawful films like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" or ""Robot Monster"" (which, oddly, didn't even make the list).

So would I recommend this movie? Probably not...unless you are intensely curious or like seeing all of the Bottom100 films.",3.0,29 April 2019
Cheesy But Not as Bad As Batman and Robin,"im not gonna sit here and justify this movie cus it cant be its crap...however if you like cheesy film (and i do) then its so cheesy its actually quite good....the effects are weird the acting is terrible and the story is poor and really weird and full of plot holes, however for some strange reason i cant fully comprehend i enjoyed it....i love these cheesy films....that aren't delibertly bad....but just cus they were cheap and couldn't afford better actors and sets...the film goes in a strange direction and i like films like that for some strange reason i cant comprehend, it isn't a movie i can really recommend but if your a fan of movies such as ""Plan 9 from outer space"" then this is your movie you'll love this....if you hate movies like that and your a fan of transformers and modern action movies then i'd probably avoid this one i think",4.0,23 September 2008
Weak movie,"I remember watching this movie once when I was a kid, it was on TV and I ""watched"" while playing. Some days ago I was looking for something to watch on Netflix and found this movie, so I decided to re-watch this. I wasn't expecting much since some years ago I watched a negative review of this movie, but it was actually worse than I thought it would be.

The script is weak with the story having a lot of inconsistencies. The villains can travel really fast from one location to another and always know were to go. Captain America's powers seems to be almost nonexistent and he fails a lot in the movie. Also most of the action scenes aren't very good.

With that said, this movie is at least watchable. On the positive side the Red Skull make-up is very good and the Captain's uniform is very accurate to the comics.",4.0,22 January 2015
Salinger treats it seriously,"Unfortunately, this is not the Marvel movie that will endear you to comic book movie adaptations. However, I think Salinger gives an honest performance as the title character, even if he spends more time out of costume than in. For whatever reason, the Red Skull is made Italian, rather than German, but it didn't bother me as much as it did some other viewers. For being a B-movie, Captain America is tolerable. Watch it first, before you make any judgements. You might be able to suspend your disbelief long enough to enjoy it.",,10 September 2000
Bad but not irredeemable,"Steve Rodgers becomes Captain America and must fight against the Nazi super soldier Red Skull. Captain America is however frozen in time until he awakens in 1990. Red Skull still wishes to fulfil his plan of world domination by becoming the president of the United States.

I went into this movie expecting to hate it since that seems to be the general consensus. What I saw was bad on many levels but not what I would call irredeemable.

On the positive side the production isn't too bad. The editing is passable except for those awful montage sequences. The cinematography and lighting is not what I would call inept. The acting is okay but the terrible writing makes for some awful line deliveries.

However, this movie has quite possibly the worst superhero costume of all time, rivalled by the motorcycle helmet wearing Captain America from the 1979 TV movie. He seems to have prosthetic ears attached to his head and the wings makes his appearance seem comical.

The tone is also all over the place. You have Nazis and Germans executing people and at the same time you have a running gag where Captain America pretends to be car sick and hijacks cars.

It's bad in a cheesy way. I would say the Fantastic Four 1994 movie was miles better in being faithful to the source material while having an extremely low budget. However, as I said, I did find some little things enjoyable like the action, special effects and even production qualities.

I think you will either hate it or find it as a harmless bit of cheesy entertainment and fun.",4.0,8 December 2017
WARNING!!! It's not quite what it seems!!!,"Back in the mid-90s I watched this film and thoroughly enjoyed it as a child even though Captain America wasn't my favourite superhero. However, out of intrigue in the last few years, I have found out that this movie got a lot of the characters and settings completely wrong. For example when was Red Skull an Italian Fascist? He's always been a Nazi. Still, after watching the excellent 2011 Captain America movie with Chris Evans (not the former DJ) I set out to purchase that film. Picked the DVD and it turned out to be this one instead. Don't get me wrong, it's not as bad as some say however there was a lot of potential wasted. One big problem the film suffers from is that the writers tried to cram every single major moment of Captain America's history into a 90-95 minute film. It dosen't work successfully. Another problem is that the film obviously had severe budget constraints as you can often tell that actors are facing backdrops. Some actors have to even play multiple roles. On the plus side the acting is watchable with a very dark opening (on par with the opening of Xmen). The actor playing Captain America (Matt Salinger, son of author JD) gives a pretty believable performance as does the actor playing Red Skull (Scott Paulin).

Its not a bad comic book movie, that title goes to Green Lantern for me. This one just should've stayed close to it's original resource material and not include every major moment of Captain America's history in 90 minutes. Having an ending where it could've been left open for sequels might've been a better idea.

5/10",5.0,2 April 2013
"Uninspired, but watchable.","After the Nazis have developed a process to turn an innocent boy into a super human entity, the Americans likewise experiment on average American youth Steve Rogers (Matt Salinger), who has polio. Steve develops incredible strength and resilience, is given a costume and shield, and is rechristened Captain America. The Cap fails spectacularly in his first mission, which is vanquishing Red Skull (Scott Paulin), the adult version of that Nazi experiment. He ends up frozen in Arctic ice for 47 years, reemerging in 1990 to do battle with the Red Skull once again.

It may be that this initial feature film vehicle for the legendary comic book hero (after two TV movies in the 1970s) will appeal more to casual viewers than longtime fans of the character. As it is, it lacks the spit and polish of major American product, and it will come off as cheesy and tacky to many viewers. Also, the scenario requires Steve to spend more time in civvies than in costume.

But this viewer didn't find it completely worthless; it's not without some amusements. Like the sight of the President (Ronny Cox), who'd glimpsed the Cap as a child, engaging in fisticuffs with various bad guys. Paulin is not a truly great villain, but he's a mild hoot anyway, and his minions include some very sexy (if inept) female assassins, including Red Skulls' own daughter (Francesca Neri). The action scenes won't blow the audience away, but they're adequate.

The main draw is a remarkably sincere Salinger, who makes for an appealing hero. Kim Gillingham, who gets an ""introducing"" credit, plays both Caps' lady friend and her daughter, and comes off better as the older lady. A variety of familiar faces - Ned Beatty, Michael Nouri, Darren McGavin, Melinda Dillon, Bill Mumy - are kind of wasted here, although McGavin at least gets a chance to be somewhat funny (it'd be a shame if he didn't).

Kids will likely be less judgmental than their adult counterparts, and might have some fun with it.

Five out of 10.",5.0,24 January 2018
Comic fans beware.,"I've never read a Captain America comic book. But I don't have to to know that any fan of the comic won't be too pleased with this film. Matt Salinger does his best with a lousy story. Captain America doesn't even finish one mission before he's frozen in ice, only to be thawed out 50 years later. The Red Skull is the villain, but in most of the movie he looks like a guy with acne problems. However, we do learn that the Red Skull had a hand in the JFK assassination. How Oliver Stone missed that lead is beyond me. The Captain's super powers seem to be limited to throwing his shield and faking car sickness. On the positive side, at times the film does have the feel of a 40's serial. I would've liked to see that carried out, but the film never decides whether to be serious or kind-of-corny. Instead it just ends up being boring.",2.0,5 January 1999
A Disappointment,"Superhero movies are again a hot property thanks to the big screen adaptations of Spider-Man, X-Men and Superman. As such, many film buffs who know little or nothing about Captain America have no doubt been picking this one up at the video store. Too bad nothing but pure crapulescence awaits them.

Where to begin? The movie has a dim look to it; the acting is second-rate; and the action and battle scenes are few and far between. It will disappoint most die-hard comic book fans, perhaps as much as those silly 1970s Cap films were. On a positive note, the action scenes aren't awful when the viewer finally gets to them. As well, the characters stay pretty true to their illustrated roots, and kids aren't going to be nearly as fussy as adult moviegoers about this one.",3.0,5 September 2004
This 1990 version of Captain America can be pretty entertaining despite some noticeable flaws,"Okay, so after watching the Republic serial from 1944 in which Captain America's alter ego was Grant Gardner, district attorney, and then two TV movie versions starring Reb Brown as Steve Rogers, occasional painter, I finally watched this 1990 version from Menahem Golan's 21st Century Film Corporation starring Matt Salinger as the super soldier from World War II that gets frozen for several decades before being thawed out. I liked the beginning where we find out about both his and The Red Skull's (Scott Paulin) early lives and there was a quite entertaining fight between them during the WWII sequence though it would have been nice to know what dastardly thing the Skull did that lead to that battle. But then we're abruptly taken to the present day to when Cap finds himself waking up to and it takes a little time to once again find some momentum. That said, having Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty as a couple of old pals now serving as president and reporter, respectively, was a nice treat for anyone who remembers them from Deliverance not to mention Beatty for his previous superhero encounter in the first two Christopher Reeve Superman movies. And how awesome it was to finally see the CA costume done right this time with both the wings on the cowl and the shield just the right size and color. Even more so was all the hot women that abounded though I have to wonder how any of them could realistically be daughters of the disfigured Red Skull! So in summation, this filmed version of Captain America may be a little on the underwhelming side concerning story logic but the action for the most part makes it worth it for at least one viewing though I probably wouldn't mind watching it again. Can't wait for Chris Evans in Captain America: The First Avenger later this summer.",5.0,5 June 2011
No. it's so bad it's good. enjoy it to laugh at it.,"I'm confirming it is lame. It suffers from the same issues as the 1994 Fantastic Four, but unlike FF I can give it a, it's so bad it's good stamp (And I'm very happy about that).

Captain America is a pretty easy comic to adapt to the big screen, it's just an action adventure war movie about a guy who sometimes wears a mask. They did take some liberties with the character that make my Fanboy radar point up, but it's superficial.

Steve Rodgers is now a boy from Southern California who has polio and offered himself up to the super soldier experiment headed up by a woman who escaped from the Nazis (The idea of a woman creating the star spangled avenger was cool, not enough female brainiacs in the comic book industry ).

Shortly after Steve Rodgers becomes Captain America the doctor is killed making Steve and The Red Skull the only one's like them. After stopping the Red Skull from destroying the White House he is trapped in Ice for 60 years and wakes up having to stop the Red Skull, who has formed an underground crime unit that basically is Hydra without saying it,again.

Proving how well Cap works as an action movie, Matt Salinger who plays Steve Rogers, wearing some sort of padding to make it look like he's got more than he does, barely wears the cartoonish suit they made for him (of course wearing the uniform makes him Captain America, duh)

It's got that 80s swagger to it. The Red Skull has his daughter do all the heavy lifting for most of the movie with her small army of rich Nazi brats who drive the fastest cars and wear the hottest fashions but more than capable with the guns.

They took some liberties with The Red Skull's origin too, I think this was to save money and film the entire movie in Italy (I'm also guessing that certain places in Italy look more like Southern California than New York City)

I am being harsh on the movie because I've grown to like the character more now than I ever did when I was a kid and saw this, but like I expressed before, the movie does have a so bad it's food quality that makes it real enjoyable.

Ah... It's not that bad...,"The movie is quite bad, but not that bad. It has its good moments. If it plays on cable TV and you have nothing better to do, it's a nice way to waste a little time. Captain America deserves a better treatment, but what's done is done...",7.0,9 August 1999
Lacked the Special Effects of the More Modern Captain America Films,"This movie begins in Italy just prior to World War 2 with government soldiers breaking into a house to kidnap a young boy and then murdering his family in the process. The reason for the kidnapping is that they need a test subject for an experiment which might allow them to create super-soldiers for their army and dreams of conquest. Yet, even though the experiment is a complete success, the doctor involved in it becomes horrified by the ruthlessness of those she works with and manages to escape to the United States with all of the secrets required to continue her work in her head. She then continues her research in the United States which eventually concludes with the making of a super-hero named ""Captain America"" (Matt Salinger) to counter the super-villain created in Italy who goes by the name of the ""Red Skull"" (Scott Paulin). Unfortunately, her success is short-lived as she is assassinated by Nazi agents and the secrets she had dies with her shortly afterward. But with war breaking out both Captain America and the Red Skull soon clash with each other and the story becomes even more pronounced after that. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say this the particular movie lacked the special effects of the more modern Captain America films which clearly resulted in an inferior picture by comparison. Even so, I didn't think the movie was necessarily bad as it still managed to entertain to a certain degree. That being said, I have rated this movie as about average and recommend it to those who enjoy films of this type.",5.0,18 September 2016
I'm just glad he wasn't a surfer dude or a crusading D.A.,"Like many Cap fans, I eagerly waited for the Captain America film and was disappointed when it went direct-to-video. When I finally saw the video, I was disappointed with the story. I did like the physical acting with Cap in costume, and I think that was the one true thing about Captain America. Rather than rant on about what was wrong, let me tell you Hollywood scripters how to do it right;

1. The first movie must spend a great deal (if not the whole movie) in WWII, where his legend will start. No urban legend in the 21st Century.

2. Steve Rogers is a NEW YORKER! He kept his optimism despite losing both parents to disease (alcoholism, pneumonia) during the Great Depression. Even in the new millennium, he loves listening to big band and 40s music and anything that sparks such nostalgia. He's still a BROOKLYN Dodgers fan.

3. What the hell was that with the plastic ears?! (Sorry, had to get that one out.)

4. Get that shield back...it was way better than not having one in the serial (a gun?) or a clear one in the TV movie.

5. Don't forget that the costume has a star on the front *and* back.

6. If you make the Red Skull (most likely villain) Italian again, so help me...

7. I wouldn't mind seeing Bucky, but you can do like the Ultimates storyline and have him non-costumed in the war if it'll help. But please don't make Cap's costume like the one in the Ultimates (either version).

8. Don't try to combine love interests (Bernie was the girlfriend during the 1980s, Sharon was the girl in the 60s and 70s, but it was wrong to make them mother and daughter.).

9. I gotta say it again...don't make him an urban legend like Batman! Captain America was created to be a symbol and INSPIRE American public and forces as a response against the Red Skull. He can't do that if he's skulking the shadows.

Thanks and good luck.",,17 April 2004
Semi-camp melodrama,"Major B movie. (That's a good thing :-) Not a complete waste of time if you appreciate melodrama with some scene-chewing hamming. I do. Quite a few fun continuity issues to have fun spotting. No more or less unfaithful to the comic book Captain America than any of the other superhero movies/TV shows. Much better than the 1979 made-for-TV movie and (mercifully) short-lived series and a little better than the 1960s animated TV show, IMO.

What raises this above a ""B-"" movie level is the ""seriousness"" of the melodrama. Fun. Watch it on cable, if it comes around or on a dollar rental. Have popcorn ready.",5.0,22 April 2005
"Not a Good Film, But Enjoyable in its Badness","Steve Rogers is turned into a super soldier to fight the Red Skull during World War II. He loses and is frozen for fifty years. When he comes back, he finds the Red Skull has assassinated Kennedy, King and has become one of the world's most powerful supervillains and businessmen. Can he stop the Skull now?

This film is fun if you like seeing a guy in a bad costume run around and throw a shield, while a man who looks and acts like Jimmy Carter is a crime-fighting president (and protector of the environment). It's light on plot, light on character development and even the action comes off as more cheesy than anything. But to be honest with you, this was more fun than almost any of the modern comic book films. (For example, ""Batman Begins"" is a phenomenal film -- but it's not as easy to sit back and laugh at with a beer.)

Why is the Red Skull Italian? As I recall from the comics, he's quite German, and there was no real reason to change this for the movie. I mean, if you're fighting the Nazis, isn't it just more logical to have the villain be German? Where did he get a daughter from? This remains unanswered. Other things seemed fishy... and even the decoder ring, which was important to the story, never paid off as fully as I would have liked (and what exactly did it decode?).

If you get a copy of this movie, keep your expectations low and your supply of Busch Light very high. Not a good movie, unless you love ripping apart such films. I do, so I loved it. But I wouldn't foist it anyone... but maybe the old ""Punisher"" film...",3.0,21 August 2007
Below average fun fest,"Watching this movie was mildly entertaining, I was not really bored. But when it was over I was like ""man, that was a dumb movie"". Started to realize the plot was not good, acting was not good...

Well, the beginning is kind of good, it sets a darker tone with the origin of Red Skull. I liked how the movie goes straight to action and does not waste too much time on explaining every detail. Things start to happen, and I'm ready for a great fun action flick. But on the latter half the plot starts to stagger and not much interesting happens. I'm glad I finally watched this weirdo movie but I hope I don't have to watch it again anytime soon.

But if you think this is bad, then watch ""Three Giant Men""...",4.0,30 September 2019
Batman Has Nothing To Worry About,"You really have to be a fan of............oh what the heck, this movie just plain stinks! The costume looks horrible, too many liberties were taken with the characters and the plot lurches forward badly. It basicly starts out with a few minutes in one place, a few minutes in another, a few more elsewhere......you get the idea, and then all these separate incidents gradually and slowly lead to one single plot. MST3K's Pod People was easier to follow ! Few good things about this, Matt Salinger looks enough like Steve Rogers should, but is hampered by the lousy script and implausible plot. The culture shock he has returning home after too many years is done fairly well, and the Red Skull seen at the top of the movie reminds me of a cross between Freddie Kruger and Jason Voorhees. This movie could have been so much better set entirely in WW2 with the opening scene of Hitler screaming at his generals, ""I could make that bellboy a better leader than any of you !"" That is from the mythos of the comic book. After the opening credits, we should have seen the process of Rogers becoming the hero who goes on to fight the Red Skull, who through most of the movie should have been spoken of and referred to, but not seen. This movie needed that sort of impact, the indication of the sort of evil the Nazis represented, but as it is, it's just one big car wreck on the ""to-do"" list at MST3K.",1.0,1 March 2001
Cheap but descent,"For starters, Matt Salinger is the best captain America, he has the same looks as the comic. And he looks likable to be someone who want to save the world.

An early failed attempt to start the MCU,"This is something that is often overlooked about this film. A couple of throw-away lines of dialogue between the future president and his friend after spotting Cap strapped to a rocket indicate there may have been plans to start the MCU with this film, as two other Marvel characters are directly name-checked. Sadly, these plans were put on hold, due to this disaster that involved Cap stealing cars by feigning car-sickness, walking away from the car, then running back and driving off when the driver went to check he was okay. Other than a few laughable moments like this however, this film is extremely dull. It's worth watching if you're a die-hard Marvel/Captain America fan, or a lover of bad film, but otherwise don't bother.",2.0,15 January 2018
MATT SALINGER MADE A GOOD CAPTAIN AMERICA,"First off i am a big fan of the wild & wicked Director ALBERT PYUN, he has created some great Gems within the low-budget B-movie genre such as my favourite film of his, Van Damme's CYBORG (1989) it's also one of my personal favourite films that i grew up watching & loving, it's in my all time top 10. Now Albert Pyun has done some too weird crud too but more often than not he creates something bizarrely fun & watchable & he does that on a tiny budget so it's impressive. Albert Pyun's CAPTAIN AMERICA is not terrible like many have said, i do remember seeing this on t.v as a kid so it's remained an image in the back of my head for years. I got the dvd now & it's rated a ""PG"" but to be honest it's too dark & grim to be a ""Kids film"" it's opening of a family being slaughtered by Nazi machine-gun fire is very dark & that sets the dull tone for the rest of the film really, everything is dull & gritty & nothing is colourful or bright not even Captain's superhero costume!!! There's some goofy humour-bits but it's mainly humourous because of some of the cheesy acting but we do get some classy veteran stars amongst the cast with Ronny Cox (Deliverance) & Ned Beatty (Deliverance) & Captain America himself Matt Salinger, who made a good Cap, i liked his look & he did a decent acting & was decent in the role & his costume was decent too. Now this was a fairly low-budget production so it's not gonna look all slick & Amazing like today c.g.i Marvel films but it's limited budget actually works for it's dark look at the world & it's atrocities such as Assassinations & murder, like i said the film has a dark tone even when it's not trying too. The film has a grainy look to it probably due to a the low-budget or just because it's an old relic of it's time, there's a very European texture to everything (it was filmed in Europe) but still shows it's Americana when Cap is on home territory & the film has an old skool Cold-war spy Thriller feel. This Cap is very different from what we all know & love from Chris Evans version of the character in the MCU, here Salinger's version is a very lost guy who seems to not be hugely heroic or action-packed & comes across traumatised by everything (as you would be) & he's actually quite enjoyable & goofy at times like when he pretends to feel sick so the person pulls over & he quickly runs back to the car & drives off leaving them behind lol he does it twice!!!

Matt Salinger really does the lost-& lonely-man from another time really well & one scene is actually emotional, a scene where Cap runs from the beach to his old neighbourhood street & to his old house where the love of his life lived with him before the war, he bumps into her daughter & then she comes to the door & it's quite shocking & sad!!! The action scenes are pretty decent but the first half is pretty boring & dull right up until Cap gets defrosted in 1993. Red skull looks really good. The music is dreary & too slushy & often the movie feels like a t.v movie drama but all in all it's solid enough in it's cheesiness to enjoy sometimes",5.0,30 July 2020

A fun movie based on a classic comic character!,"I've always liked this movie. It was made as a low-budget film, but I think it all came together pretty well. I was always a big fan of the Captain America character and comics and was really excited when I first saw it on video. The origin of Captain America is fairly faithful to the comics, but the Red Skull character is really different. In fact, I think the Red Skull character in this film is what makes it interesting. This movie is different enough from the comics that it makes it worth watching (otherwise you should just stick to the comics), yet it is faithful enough in the style and personalities of the characters and storylines so as not to disappoint longtime Captain America fans.

Instead of being German, the Red Skull is Italian. You also find out about how Red Skull got his start while the comics are a little obscure about his origin. There is a lot of bright outside filming to this action-adventure. It is also quite funny at moments. My advice to the viewer is not to take it too seriously. Just enjoy yourself and you won't be disappointed. It helps to be open-minded. Besides, the actress that plays the Red Skull's evil daughter is HOT!",,10 February 2004
Captain America: About on par with the 1979 outings,"Captain America returns after over a decade on the shelf with a shiny new shield and somewhat less ridiculous costume but is it any less cheesy?

Well, yeah but it's no better.

Captain Americas origin story is told and after thawing out he goes after his nemesis the Red Skull.

Much like the 1970's movies Cap is in civilian clothes for the vast majority of the film which I find a strange decision, the action sequences aren't as frequent but a tad more realistic.

Costing over 10 million this was considered a big deal but despite a star studded cast this was actually somewhat of a bore and the leading man seemed out of his depth.

Outside of the modern Cap movies I'd recommend the 70's movies over this or the 1944 classic.

The Good:

Red Skull actually looks quite good (For the brief moments he's in it)

The Bad:

Matt Salinger is such a goofy looking guy and the mask just makes it worse

Incredibly boring for an action film

Things I Learnt From This Movie:

Marvel actively declaring one of their heroes is inferior to a DC one seems a bit foolish",3.0,23 December 2017
For fanboys and girls only.,"First of all, who knew that famed reclusive J.D. Salinger even had a son, let alone a B-Movie actor son? That's right, the actor who plays Steve Rogers/Capt. America is Matt Salinger, son of the aforementioned author of ""Catcher in the Rye"". About the movie though. I wouldn't rate this as a horrible movie, but it sure wasn't good. Salinger did an OK job as the Cap but his acting prowess wasn't quite good enough to pull off the 50's guy coping with the 90's lifestyle the script called for. And the Red Skull? How do you mess that up?! He's one of the scariest freaking villains in all of comicdom, how could you go wrong? Oh, buy making him a Caucasian Greek mob boss, that's how. I would only recommend this film to die hard fans of the cap or true movie geeks. I happen to be both so I made myself find some good qualities (but it was really, really hard).

As for those of you who share my affinity for comics and bad movies but can't seem to get their hands on this gem, I can only tell you that it's been out of print for more than a decade now and your best bet is to find it at the next comic con in your area or at a flea market that sells bootleg tapes (ditto that for the Fantastic Four movie from '94).",3.0,21 December 2004

Good for a laugh.,"Sights and Sounds - The cinematography for this movie is pretty bad. The camerawork isn't all the great. The visual presentation is below average and makes this movie even more boring. There aren't a lot of effects, but for the most part they are hideously bad.

Characters - All the characters are actually somewhat decent. The acting is ok. Some of the actors are worse than others. This movie tries to have several very dramatic and sad scenes that are a bit undercut by the subpar acting. If the actors were better, I'd probably have been closer to tears but as-is I was laughing.

Geography - For some reason the people making this movie didn't take into account the world when they were making it. Germany, Washing DC, Alaska, and California are nowhere near as close to each other as they seem to think. Also, you can't drive a car from California to Italy (which I'm assuming is what they did. There is no implication that they flew, and I'm pretty sure that Captain America doesn't have a valid passport).

Plot - The plot is ok, but the problem is that its executed very sloppily. If you're not paying very close attention, nothing is going to make any sense. Overall, the sequence of events in this movie are pretty random.

Language - There are a few scenes where people aren't speaking English. For some reason, only about every other line is subtitled. Just random parts of the conversation are translated. I don't care if the Germans are speaking German, just make up your mind wether or not you want us English-speakers to understand.

Overall, this a poorly made, boring movie. Its not really worth to watch as a so-bad-that-its-good movie because its not even that funny except for a few ""wtf"" moments.",4.0,16 March 2018
Terrible.,"Looking at this film, and then comparing it to the latest superhero films, is like watching a football match of the third national division and trying to compare it to any European Champions League match. It is almost unfair to make this comparison, which, despite that, is almost inevitable.

In fact, in 1990, we were a long way from the visual spectacle that CGI got used to us, and which revolutionized cinema at all levels. That, and also cinematography, would be enough for this film to look primitive. However, this film has a bad plot, poorly developed and badly played by second-rate actors, directed by Albert Pyun, a name that instantly transports us to the universe of B and ""trash"" films. The result, therefore, was predictable. Rather than a third national division football match, this film is closer to an inter-school soccer tournament.

Surprisingly, the film even starts well: without wasting time with introductions, it reveals the creation of the two rivals: the Red Skull and Captain America, whose origins are linked, a thing that the film reasonably reveals and explores. However, the script, by Stephen Tolkin, did not prove capable of developing the plot that, from some point, becomes irritating, predictable, uninteresting. The ending is so anti-climatic that I don't think it's worth talking about it.

Matt Salinger is not a bad actor, but he was not born to be a protagonist nor is he particularly talented. He seems to struggle and tries to take himself so seriously that he sounds forced. Perhaps it would have been better if he tried to have a little more fun with his character and make the film sound funny. He didn't, and it became horrible, and it helped a lot to take the fun out of a movie that otherwise might at least have been funny. It is a pity.",1.0,9 February 2021

Good B class movie.,"The recently deceased Albert Pyun offered us great class B films that with barely a budget at least fulfilled the function of entertaining. The key was to have some history, a cast immersed in the story and not rely on special effects (on that issue we barely have a couple of sequences that stand out). Although it cannot be compared to the later works, it is a decent film that offers us the classic heroes in their confrontation with their nemesis Red Skull while the fate of the free world hangs in the balance. It has rarely been possible for an action film made by a specialist in exploitation cinema to remain in the memory of moviegoers. This is one of those rare cases.",5.0,3 December 2022
I don't understand how anyone can dislike this movie,"I was a child when I first watched ""Captain America,"" and I loved it. So, when I saw that it was on Hulu.com, I decided to rewatch it and relive some of my childhood. I also wanted to see how I would evaluate it as an adult. Did my childhood naiveté color my perception of this movie? Did I only think it was great because I was too young to understand it? My conclusion- absolutely not! THIS MOVIE IS GREAT. It has a solid story, good action sequences, a great pace, and Matt Salinger is perfect in his role.

Some people may criticize this movie because it lacks CGI and modern effects, but I think that this is an area in which the current generation is spoiled. CGI is used way too often nowadays, and I much prefer traditional special effects. None of the special effects in this movie looked fake, and the fight sequences in it were much superior to modern films where the camera is so zoomed in and shaky that you can't tell what's happening.

This movie also has a good message and heart. It's not just flashing lights and oohs and aahs- it has a story. I highly recommend it to anyone, and I seriously doubt that the upcoming Captain America film will surpass this masterpiece.",10.0,8 January 2010
"""Captain America"" gets way more flack for being cheesy and low budget than it deserves","Before 1998's ""Blade,"" Marvel Comics couldn't seem to catch a break when it came to movie versions of their different properties. In the wake of ""Iron Man 3"" and ""The Avengers,"" I know that's very hard to believe. There was a serial for Captain America released in 1944 through Republic Pictures. George Lucas executive produced a live-action adaptation of ""Howard the Duck"" in 1986.

The next few years up to Wesley Snipes' take on the legendary vampire slayer were plagued with low-budget versions of the comic book publisher's characters. Dolph Lundgren's ""The Punisher"" couldn't even muster a theatrical release in the U.S. Roger Corman's ""The Fantastic Four"" never officially saw the light of day anywhere, although bootleg copies float around.

21st Century Film Corporation released ""Captain America"" straight to video in the middle of those two disasters. For many years, the movie was hard to get a hold of and only released on VHS. Shout! Factory released it on DVD and made it widely available to those who sought it out for so many years as a sort of Nerd Holy Grail.

Several years after being caught by Red Skull and left for dead, Steve Rogers is found frozen in the ice and thawed out. He discovers Red Skull received plastic surgery to hide his true identity and is heading up a group of world leaders set on kidnapping the President of the United States for their own diabolical ambitions.

Is ""Captain America"" filled with cheese? If you judge it from a modern standpoint, of course it is. If you look at it as being a piece of World War II propaganda filmed in the 1940s, you'll find it totally hits its mark. That's the standpoint I choose to view it from.

My only real issue is that we only get about 5 minutes of face time from the real Red Skull. The rest of the film features actor Scott Paulin in flesh-colored make-up topped with scar lines. It's a real letdown for fans of the Red Skull who wanted to see the character the way he looks in the comic books.

I still think that ""Captain America"" gets way more flack for being cheesy and low budget than it deserves. Is it on the same quality level as ""Captain America: The First Avenger?"" No way! However, it has an inviting and personal flavor to it that still works 23 years later. Real comic book fans will find value in this adaption and appreciate it for what it is.",7.0,22 May 2013
Captain America (1990),"Back in Marvel's early 90's days. This God awful, pathetic, cheap, and cheesy film plagued the world. It's horrible. Not just the cheap costumes or poor make-up, which goes so far as to give Captain America plastic ears to stop chafing. Captain America is the worst hero of all time. His greatest technique is pretending to be sick so that people get out of their cars. Very confusing, especially when the Red Skull is revealed to be Italian for some reason. It's also poorly shot, with one segment lit entirely with blue lights, like some dodgy porno. The shield throwing soon gets old, and even it's camp charm couldn't keep my attention. I'd accept this from the 60's, but after the release of Burton's Batman, comic films should have known better.

This is the Best B-movie i've ever seen!,"You can't take this film too seriously. Like almost every straight to video movie. Its a B-movie! i mean come on the only thing that didn't make it a b-movie was a sex scene and they probably cut it out. The film had the feel of an old forties flick. The plot was pretty insulting though but it did capture some horrors of WW2 maybe not very well but somewhat. it was an insult ot all Cap fans to have Cap basically screw up his first mission. The Red Skull only looked decent in ONE! count it ONE Scene. The rest of the film he looked like a freak! please come on people HES THE FREAKING RED SKULL!!

"Lukewarm, but nostalgia gets you","I remember when this movie came out in 1990. It was released in Cannon Cinemas in Great Britain. Captain America himself was there on the opening night handing out shields,flags and a big ol' slice of moms apple pie. I was expecting typical Cannon material, cheap and cheerful, and looked forward as the movie started. Then the lights went out, the movie started and i had to sit through 90mins of the most uninspired trash. The problem lies first and formost with the script. It has awfull dialougue weak characters and worst of all no humour. How can we laugh along with the movie if there are no laughs?. Albert Pyun is the best director to be expected for such a project, both Cyborg and Sword and the Sorceror were half decent, but he has a really difficult time handeling this movie. Aslo, Mat Sallinger is TOO bland as Captain America. Maybe if Cannon had forked out for someone like Dolph Lundgren or Miles O'Keefe [both had worked for Cannon before], we'd have sympathised with Cap more. Worst still is Scot Paulin as The Red Skull. A character as unbelievable as that needs a little humour. Just as Frank Langella was a good choice as Skelator in Cannon's earlier Masters of the Universe, Paulin is bad. Thank god for Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox, who just about rescue this poor film from dying. Also there is half decent special effects and a good version of Caps suit, sheild. Overall though, a disappointment. Possibly the most unrememborable film in history",4.0,22 August 2001
"""If we don't take this medicine now, we'll all die. Slowly... but we'll die. Thank you.""","During WWII, a brave, patriotic young man undergoes a series of painful experiments that turn him into a super-human. He takes the persona of red, white, and blue wearing Captain America and heads to Nazi Germany to do battle with a character known as Red Skull. Red Skull is a similarly enhanced man. Captain America loses the battle and ends up frozen in ice in the wilds of Alaska. Fifty or so year later, Caps body is found. After he's un-thawed and regains his senses, he discovers that his old foe, Red Skull, has taken a secret identity, but is still up to his old tricks. His latest plot involves kidnapping the President of the United States so he can implant a controlling device in his head. Cap will once again try to stop Red Skull.

While not a total disaster, the 1990 version of Captain America isn't what I'd call a ""good"" movie. My main problem is with the script. It's what I'd call lazy. There is no logic behind much of what happens on-screen. I'm going to limit this to two or three examples of what I'm talking about. Otherwise, this could go on forever. First, Cap is thawed in Alaska. As he's walking through Canada, a reporter from Washington, driving a pick-up truck, just happens to be in the right place at the right time and almost literally runs in to Cap. Yeah, sure. To stretch believablity even further, a gang of baddies from Italy, who are also searching for Captain America, miraculously discover his whereabouts at almost the exact same moment. What are the odds that these people would find a lone man on foot in the wilds of Canada at the same time? It's just stupid.

The second example of poor, lazy writing and a lack of logic involves the ""crew"" Red Skull sends to take out Captain America. You'd think that a real bad dude like Red Skull would have an army of henchmen at his disposal. But for some bizarre reason, he doesn't. Instead, he sends his 20-something daughter, her model friends, and their boyfriends to deal with his mortal enemy. I can't think of a less threatening looking group of supposed killers.

For my third example, I'll mention the aftermath of the Preident's kidnapping. Captain America and his little girlfriend are looking for the President, but they appear to be alone. Where in the world is the Secret Service? Where are the Italian police? Where is the military? If the Preident of the USA were to actually be kidnapped, almost everything in the entire world would come to a complete halt. Instead, things in Italy, where the President was kidnapped, seem to be going on as if nothing happened. Not very likely and, again, stupid.

Add these problems I have with this dog of script to some pretty bad acting, poor special effects, a mind-numbingly ineffectual Captain America, and lame fight choreography and you've got a bad movie on your hands. While I did enjoy bits and pieces of the film, the whole is so bad I cannot give Captian America a positive rating.",4.0,17 November 2017

The movie is shot at Adriatic sea, which guarantees a beautiful scenery, and chases in Dubrovnik are a real joy. I was worried because it's produced in Yugoslavia in cooperation with Jadran Film, but from the result I suppose 21th Century Production and Marvel Entertainment had most of the work done. Movie is pretty much faithful to comics and Captain America's costume is just as it should be. Acting is decent, action is few, but when it comes it's well directed, and movie has nice comic-book atmosphere. There's no nudity, vulgarity or explicit violence, except for gunfights and common fist-fighting, so it's whole family friendly. There are few nicely done emotional scenes and just a bit of humor. I enjoyed it very much.

A curiosity piece for fans only,"(38%) Just before the days of mega budget, effect ridden, super blockbuster Marvel comic book movies, the world had this, and compared to the brilliant Batman movie released around the same this is pretty weak. What this rather forgettable movie does show though is how far these movies have come in quite a short period of time. The most notable aspect of this is how old and dated it looks. Its release was delayed and it really shows as this feels more like an early 80's movie than an early 90's one. Matt Salinger as the title role gives a dull performance throughout, particularly for a man that not only was given super powers, but frozen in time for decades, as he may as well be doing his taxes. Couple that with a plot that is very loose around the edges and your left with a movie that can only be enjoyed as a curiosity piece and nothing more.",4.0,30 September 2014
One of the best Captain America movies yet!!!,I love this movie! Captain America and the Red Skull are both in it and both look as they should. The origin is true to the comics and Captain America's costume looks very cool. He does throw the shield and knock down the Red Skull a few times in the movie. It's more of an origin movie but it's a very exciting one. Definitely watch it!,,1 October 2002
Not worth your time.,"This is not the worst comic book adaptation as many have said. It is a dull movie with almost no special effects and a story that has no delivery whatsoever. Most of the actors sleepwalk through this film(the Red Skull's daughter for example looks particularly sleepy) and there is hardly any adventure to speak of. Matt Salinger is OK as Captain America but even he can't shake the boredom out of this movie. The only positive is the costume and shield. Too bad Captain America is in costume for so little screen time. The least said about the Captain's modern day girlfriend the better.

"A prime example of what a ""1"" vote should be reserved for.","This is without question one of the worst films I have ever seen. It fails in so many ways that I feel it is a perfect example of a what a film should be to rate a ""1"" on the IMDb Vote.

1. It fails as an adaptaion of a comic. Captain America is not a great hero who is frozen and thawed in this film. He is a ill prepared looser who gets his butt kicked in his first ever fight. Then we don't even see the red white and blue and shield again until the final fight. Captian America was an ""action"" comic folks. A film about Captain America should have lots of action!

2. This is somewhat related but even if you decide to give the film maker a break on the lack of action the rubbish in the middle is so boring that you will wear out the head on your VCR as you fast forward looking for something that looks promising.

3. I don't care what the apologists for this film say the acting is not good in this film.

4. The plot is terrible. Come on. Even if Cap could have diverted the rocket launched at the White House by kicking the fin, and even if he could have survived the impact I really have trouble figuring out why a rocket that is supposed to only have to travel to Washington DC has enough fuel to get to Alaska.

As bad as it gets for Marvel,"I realize that almost all of the bad superhero movies I've seen (""Catwoman"", ""Steel"") were all based on DC properties. I knew I simply had to watch this movie if only because it's the lowest rated film based on a Marvel comic on this entire website. I think my old worst Marvel movie was ""Daredevil"" and this is easily worse. At least it's a step up from ""Killer Tomatoes Eat France!"". There are simply so many things wrong with this movie and I am so glad they made a good movie with ""Captain America: The First Avenger"". While that personally isn't one of my favorite Marvel movies, it's great to compare the two and how the new one is so much better.

This one makes the mistake of having a third of it set in World War II, instead of the whole movie. This was set up much better in the recent movie. The special effects are quite poor, with Captain America's shield looking like a giant Frisbee. They couldn't even get the Red Skull right. He has a nose in this movie for some reason, even though it's obvious skulls don't have full noses. He didn't have ears, so why did they get that right but not his nose? There's a scene where Captain America grabs him and the Red Skull cuts off his own hand. Why not just cut Captain America's hand off? The Captain himself is weak and a jerk in this movie. He steals a good guy's car and just leaves him alone on the road!

Later, he steals another car. He's easily beaten by the Red Skull when he first appears. This is one pathetic superhero. The Red Skull even forgets that he read a newspaper that the Captain was frozen for decades! He spends most of this movie not even as a skull. They could have at least said he wore a mask instead of some insane plastic surgery. The movie goes on too long and its climax is boring. The Captain was supposed to have polio before the experiment, but he's a perfectly capable tall human being before!

Just Kind of Forgetful,"Not to be confused with Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), Captain America is a cheaply made adaptation of the now famous Avenger, executive produced by the actual Stan Lee. Given a limited release years after it was initially made, Captain America is about the titular hero's (Matt Salinger) early years fighting the Germans and Italians during WWII. After attempting to sabotage Nazi rocket experiments, spearheaded by arch-nemesis The Red Skull (Scott Paulin), Cap is put on ice and is unfrozen in 1990s. He then is caught up in an assassination plot involving the American President (Ronny Cox).

Captain America is a lazy, inept, structure-less low-budget film that never truly reaches the dubious heights of ""so bad it's good"". Unlike the audaciously ridiculous Fantastic Four (1994) film that was supposedly the last straw for Lee, Captain America is just benignly boring. The film is even more painful when you consider that Matt Salinger is actually trying here. He's not strictly speaking bad as Captain America, he's just out of his depth and undermined at every turn by director Albert Pyun's unflattering visuals. Well at least Captain America finally got a real debut in 2011 thus allowing fans to all but ignore this cheap and boring film.",3.0,9 May 2016

America has never been a fave of mine he was just cheesy and the costume was really corny.....I just found him boring, I have always however liked the Red Skull he's a good villian. The movie was directed by Albert Pyun (who can sometimes make a visually interesting movie but is still somewhat a hack) and produced by Menahem Golan (the guy half responsible for all those terrible Cannon movies...all except Lifeforce really) so the movie already has the odds against it. But it was entertaining most of the time but a lot of that is because I have a fondness for low budget films. I think the heart was in the right place but the script was not. Actually parts of the movie work well and others don't, the acting from Matt Salinger as pretty good as was Scott Paulin (even though I think his voice sounded like Dexter's from Dexter's Laboratory) and with the exception of when the missle passes by the kid the visual effects were cool in a low tech way. The big problem with the movie other than changing characters back story was changing Red Skull (looking cool at the beginning) into some mafioso with makeup that looks at best o.k. in some scenes. Actually the whole movie is laughable (especially Caps' old girlfriends husband who sits around looking really stupid & confused) but the heart was in the right place & there is a likeable quality to it....even though the environmental stuff was irritating and preachy.

Matt Salinger is earnest enough in the lead, but isn't given anything decent to do, Scott Paulin is awful as the Red Skull and his cheesy make-up doesn't do him any favours, Michael Nouri is hilariously miscast as Cap's WW2 C.O. and fine actors like Ronny Cox, Ned Beatty, Darren McGavin and Bill Mumy are all grossly wasted.

When he's thawed out, he discovers the Red Skull is still around and causing trouble, although now part of a conspiracy involving mafia and military industrialist types who want to stop the President because he's an environmentalist. Oh, brother!

This is the kind of crap comic book movies used to be, with a few notable exceptions. It's directed by schlockmeister Albert Pyun, probably best remembered today for the Jean-Claude Van Damme ""classic"" Cyborg. Pyun made a lot of low-budget garbage over the years. You can count on one hand the number of times he made something approaching good. And I'm talking about a hand with several fingers missing. Anyway, Pyun directs this with his usual lack of talent. The cast is poor, led by wooden Matt Salinger (son of author J.D. Salinger) who has the unfortunate duty of trying to act while dressed up in a costume that appears to be made of rubber, complete with padding and fake abs. Scott Paulin plays the Red Skull (an Italian fascist here instead of a German Nazi, for some bizarre reason). He treats the role as camp and plays it up as the joke that it is. His accent is a mix of Super Mario and the Count from Sesame Street. The Red Skull's mask is slightly less embarrassing than Captain America's costume but only because it looks like something left over from a horror movie rather than something true to the source material. He spends a large amount of the movie without the Skull mask because he had plastic surgery to hide who he is. He still looks grotesque and I found it hard to believe he could fool anybody looking like that. The rest of the cast includes familiar faces like Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Darren McGavin, and Michael Nouri. McGavin and Nouri both use hammy Texas accents because they're generals and all cornball movie generals sound the same

This stinks, plain and simple. Several times in the movie Captain America, our big hero, uses the ""feets don't fail me now"" approach to battle. In other words, he runs away like a scared little girl. The action scenes are unexciting. The script was written by someone recovering from brain surgery. The direction and editing are inept. The music score is forgettably generic. The whole production is laughably cheap. It does have camp value and some appeal as a curiosity for comic book fans who might want to see how far we've come. Just prepare yourself for the awfulness.",3.0,1 September 2015
Captain America: The True Comic Film,"To many people bash this movie, and personally, I think it is one of the most faithful adaptations I've ever seen from anything to screen for this time period.

THE BAD: The red skull's look at the end of the movie wasn't really all that crappy... it just wasn't the red skull... I have to admit they did take their time to get where they were going in the middle of the movie.

THE GOOD: The good greatly outweighs the bad in this film. Matt Salinger does a perfect rendition of Steve Rogers/ Captain America in his childish ""gee whiz"" kind of way. The Red Skull's make up in the first half of the film is breath taking, and Scott Paulin (with a great assist from the script) gives more character depth to the Red Skull than I've ever seen in the comics. The opening half hour rushes by with grace, ending with a fantastic battle inside a Nazi stronghold, and the climatic battle between Cap and the skull at the end is also unbelievable. And don't get me started on the ""Pull over. I feel sick."" parts of it.

OVERALL: One of the best comic films out there, even after seeing some of today's, it's the perfect adventure for the whole family!",8.0,12 May 2005
Pretty funny if you don't take it seriously.,"Despite my rating. I'm not saying this movie is great. It's pretty laughably bad. But compared to other classic Marvel movies (Which are so bad I'm not gonna mention) It's watchable. Obviously DC had better classic movies around the time this came out, but at least Matt Salinger's Captain America has that classic costume.

The action and the plot could use a lot of work, and the whole thing seems like they did it on a really small budget. But watch it if you want a good laugh. Or if you want to remember all those really awful Marvel cartoons made from the 40s - 90s.",7.0,2 August 2019
Captain America falls flat.,"I am like the other reviewer who saw the poster of this in a theater, oddly enough I think I was there to see Batman Returns. The poster was a picture of his shield and I said that might be cool, but alas this movie would never make it to the big screen. The problem is they apparently ran out of money after the first scene. Captain America goes after the Red Skull beating up Nazi soldiers then totally gets beaten up by the skull that doesn't look like a skull, but it is still creepy. Cap gets tied to a rocket which is launched at the White House then he diverts it to Alaska. After this the budget runs out and the middle is just the guy without his costume running around in modern America. The skull is still around and he now looks like a guy with a bad sunburn and he is trying to kidnap the Pres. There is a little action at the end, but it is not as good as the promising beginning. Cap does get to beat up the skull at the end too, but the guy has to be pretty old at this point so it isn't really a fair fight.

The costume is pretty good and the guy looks like Captain America, but he is kinda whiney. This film isn't very good, but a worse Marvel movie is The Punisher, they couldn't even get the costume right in that one.",3.0,17 April 2001

Yuck,"The reason why Marvel can't get a decent box-office hit is because they don't have a big motion picture corporation backing them like DC does (DC is owned by Warner Brothers). Even though Men in Black was a success, Marvel has had more hits than misses: The Spider Man TV movies, The Punisher (a guilty pleasure of mine to watch), and The Fantasic Four (I remember E! making a big deal about it, but I never saw it in the theatres or the video stores). Captain America is also another Marvel movie miss. Talent like Matt Salenger, Ronny Cox, Ned Beatty, Bill ""Don't call me Billy"" Mumy, and Darren McGavin are wasted in this 97 minute disaster. You don't get to learn much of the characters and the storyline is bouncing all over the place. Kim Gillingham shows promise as she plays a duel role as Cappy's girlfriend back in the 40's, and his girlfriend's daughter in the 90's. There is some songs by Southside Johnny and one of the Neville brothers on the soundtrack for what it's worth.

HUH??,"As my wonderful finance wrote in his review below I'm a huge Cap. America fan. Heck I love marvel comics period. That is why I can say this is yet another example on how most marvel comics simply do not make good movies. It's could be worse in the sense it's not Batman and Robin. But I put this movie somewhere between camp and what-on-God's earth-where-they-thinking -when-they-made-this ? Things that really bugged me

1. Not staying very faithful to the comic story line. Not important for enjoying the movie. But as a comic fan it's something silly I just wanted to mention.

2.The red skull seems like he should in the Dick Tracy movie. He's not a evil, cruel Nazi. He's a smooth Itialan gangster type. One of the reasons that the red skull my favorite comic book bad guys is he's a scary guy. This red skull well, he's not all that scary.

3. For a movie called Cap.America most of the movie takes place in Italy.

4.Matt Salinger spends most of the movie seeming totally clueless. It's like he's waiting for the director to tell him what to do. Or he didn't read the script. Most likely both.

5. Kim Gillingham is so annoying as the valley girl in this movie. I just wanted to smack her all through out the film.

6.The fact that the president gets kidnapped and nobody on the planet seems to care.

7. Campy dialogue and situations. Such as the red skull's daughter's big insult to Sharon is that she'll get lines. SO! The bad thing is that I think of that stupid scene every time I put moisturizer on in the morning. Or Steve faking car sickness to steal a car. Or well, half the movie.

So the movie is garbage. But I will admit it's not the worst comic book movie ever made. Howard the Duck, Batman and Robin, the Punisher, the Fantastic Four and TV's live action Spiderman stink much worse. so it's the worst, but hardly recommended.",2.0,12 December 2001
Best film variation of a superhero yet!,"Many critics have panned this film, and I think it's a sad fate for such a well done and thought-out movie. It doesn't rely on over-the-top special effects and overblown action scenes. Instead, this is a thinking man's superhero movie, focusing on the power of the characters to show what true heroes are.

Captain America and the Red Skull are counterparts, both representing the pride of their countries, America and Germany, respectively, back in WW2. Both have been shot with a super-serum which transforms them into world-class athletes. They fight, Cap loses and is tied to a runaway rocket, which crashes into Alaska. He is preserved there until the 1990's, when he get resurrected and he realizes Red Skull is still alive and healthy, because the serum has allowed him to last this long. He is responsible for the deaths of several historic figures, including Robert Kennedy, John Kennedy, and Martin Luther King. And his next target is the newest U.S. president. Cap must stop him before it is too late, and at the same time, he must come to grips with the fact that he is in a strange new world and everything he has ever known in gone forever, and that if it hadn't been for him failing to defeat Skull the first time, many people would still be alive.

The Red Skull, also, hates what he has become, and Captain America resurfacing represents a part of him he wishes was dead. He therefore takes all measures to make sure Cap is killed. The way they constantly pursue each other is both exciting and moving.

As someone mentioned, this is a great deal like ""Forever Young,"" especially the way Cap comes back to life and finds his girlfriend extremely old. And ""Cap"" is the better of the two movies. It has a government-conspiracy plot worthy of a Dean Koontz novel, and it also throws in a lot of comic-book silliness. The balance works, and combined with tremendous acting and a moving theme song, ""Home of the Brave,"" I will proudly state that this is the best variation on a comic book super hero that has ever been put to the screen!",10.0,1 May 1999
"Could have been much worse; luckily, no Lundgren or Clooney!","Let me start by saying that I am not a die hard Captain America fan, and I think it's because I remember the made for TV movies from the late seventies that scarred my for life. At least they made the costume right this time!

However, my fiancee is a Captain America fan, and I rented it for her, but I couldn't help myself, and I popped it into the VCR, just to see Cap on the screen. And I really got interested in it. I watched it all the way through, and enjoyed it all the way. Sure it has flaws in it, and its cheesy in that Adam West/Batman sort of way, but I have seen worse movies, we all have. And I guess I'm proof that you don't have to be a Captain America fan to enjoy the film, so long as you aren't looking for Shakespeare. Just sit back and enjoy it...don't question it, just enjoy it, and you might see it in a better light.",6.0,2 December 2001
More like Captain Crunch...,"Matt Salinger stars as Captain America, the super soldier from the 1944 comics that was popular because of WW2, however the 1991 revival brings Captain America out of suspended animation, to face off against his old foe the Red Skull. Captain America is really lame for a couple of reasons. 1)If Red Skull has dominated the market of the world for so many years, why is it not so bad. 2)If Captain America is so heroic, how come he gets his ass kicked so many times? 3)Is it necessary to provide exhausted fish out of water jokes? I have no idea of the answer, however Captain America is a bomb. What is most interesting is that there is little heroic activity going on. Many people dislike The Punisher made in 1989 (It's my personal guilty pleasure) but at least there Dolph Lundgren always came off as a guy you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley. So did Christopher Reeve and Michael Keaton in the Superman and Batman movies. In Matt Salinger though, one gets the impression that he belongs doing gymnastics instead of giving out the old fashioned passionate ass beatings that the role requires. Also the movie is awkwardly directed by Albert Pyun, who directed Cyborg, Kickboxer 2, Bloodmatch and Kickboxer 4. I think right there explains the problem, wonder needs to be given to the concept of a superhero. He's not like some kickboxer who aimlessly wanders through life until forced in battle, Captain America needs to explode into action and deliver a hero worthy of excellence. Captain America would be bearable if the action sequences were any good but without surprisingly Pyun mishandles these guaranteeing that Captain America comes up super lame.

Decent movie,"Saw this movie in the video store several years ago. Was not a fan of Captain America (the comic), but it was Marvel so I gave it a shot. I didn't expect much from Marvel. It was a B-movie. Not some abomination that should be condemned, though, it was watchable. I actually liked it. Sure the effects weren't great, but what do you expect from Marvel and a B-movie. Someone who knows nothing of CA can sit, watch and enjoy this movie. I would say it is more suited for the 6-12 year old range, but as long as you're not going to critique every minor flaw...give it a shot. Parents can let their kids watch this flick without a worry, they might even learn something about patriotism.

What got me though was the striking similarities with the Mel Gibson Movie ""Forever Young."" I found Captain America to be the better of the two.

Bad Medicine,"You know when you really want to like a movie, even after all the bad press and all the negative reviews that gather muster when a movie is really really bad! Well regardless of all that was said and done, I was adamant that I was going to check out the Menachem Golan produced and Albert Pyun directed big screen version of Marvel's first avenger Captain America.

Now I knew going into the movie that Albert Pyun's track record in making decent movies was few and far between and sure enough was in the words of Ronny Cox's who played the president in the movie, it's all bad medicine! Granted the major highlight for me was the villain The Red Skull, essayed in the movie by Scott Paulin, a longtime favourite of Pyun's if you ever check out Paulin's filmography, curiously Paulin also doubles up as an army doctor near the beginning of the movie.

As for the Matt Salinger playing Steve Rogers/Captain America, he tried, but wearing that goofy looking suit and spouting Stephen Tolkin's rigid dialogue, made his task nigh on impossible.

There is so much wrong with the movie, one such problem was the suggestion that the Red Skull was to the forefront of all the major assassinations throughout history, and the other was the environmental message running throughout the movie, I don't want to preached to whilst watching a superhero movie, I just want to enjoy the marvel of it all.

Is it a good thing that this movie is seriously hard to find, perhaps! and I must say that whilst watching the movie it reminded of Superman 4 - The Quest For Peace, and what that was trying to do, try less to entertain and strive more for force feeding us the viewer an environmental message.

You do have to wonder if this movie was made to keep the copyright alive, much like the Roger Corman produced Fantastic Four movie, which was also somewhat on the dreadful side.

All in all, this version will be consigned to the vaults of history and by doing so we will all feel very thankful.

My rating is 2/10, why 2? because it's Captain America, plus Albert Pyun directed the movie. With Pyun, you will never know what to expect, for every Sword And The Sorceror, we get Crazy Six!",2.0,23 March 2011
"""God bless you Captain America""","It's very low-budget might not do its larger-than-life plotting any favours, but still I found ""Captain America"" to be somewhat enjoyable comic-book madness by film-maker Albert Pyun. Its b-grade camp, which looks much older than it is like something out of the 70s. While ambitious, the half-hearted execution seems to stumble through it and really does hold it back. Some familiar names turn up in the cast some you wonder why; like Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty. Matt Salinger as Captain America is a little stiff, but Scott Paulin lives it up as his disfigured arch-criminal the Red Skull. Also popping are Michael Nouri and a lively Darren McGavin. The formulaic plot is just as bumpy, as the film's pacing. More interest lurks within its early sequences (setting up the origins of our hero / villain), before the narrative's structure actually finds itself in modern times. At times it can meander (especially during the mid-section where Captain America is coming to grips with the situation he finds himself in) and the melodramatics are particularly dull, but the confrontations between the Red Skull and Captain American are colourfully staged. Also there are one or two decent action set-pieces. However some moments are truly under-lit. Pyun's direction is limited, but he makes good use of locations especially when it hits its European setting. Special effects come off completely hokey with their daft delivery. No way is it successful in making it work, but I expected much worse and came away quite diverted by this blotchy b-grade superhero fare.",4.0,3 June 2011

Knew it was bad...,"I just expected this movie to be bad, reading the reviews, so I saw it in a different perspective...

What went wrong in this movie is simple: Cap was not involved in a worldwide mission to save the universe, he was just there to quest for his origins and of course find the Red Skull...

However, turning this from a WWII perspective into a contemporary story was the big mistake. Hoping Marvel learned from that mistake when they released X-Men in 2000 (and not only from that, but also the Fantastic Four and The Punisher, the latter being released this Spring 2004...).

And worst, it was produced by Menachem Golan and Yoram Globus, the same who did a mess out of Superman 4 !!!!

See it for curiosity, but die-hard Captain America fans should wait for a better story out of Mr (Avi) Arad or Stan ""The Man"" itself...

But I think they really wanted to make a sort of ""what would happen if Cap was alive today"", and since I thought that both Cap's and Skull's costumes were silly in the first place, I didn't mind.

What did you seriously expect this film to be?,"Most on here who has written really damning reviews are perhaps been a little unkind and need to put things in perspective.

Firstly this film came from the remnants of the B movie empire, Cannon films (the company who brought Jean Claude Van Damme to fame and made lots of forgettable films with Chuck Norris and Charles Bronson). Secondly it was made on an incredibly tight budget that wouldn't even cover the catering bill of a modern Marvel film.. Thirdly this was made in 1990, so pre-CGI days where unless you were making a Star Trek movie or the original Total Recall film, then you had to do everything the old fashioned way without computer help using practical effects and without the backing of a major studio.

Whilst director Albert Pyun may have been desperate to make this film because he was a Marvel comics fan, his experience at the time consisted of a handful of low budget action films for Cannon flms. He does the best with what he has but the limitations are evident.

The film is a Captain America origins story and is surprisingly close to its source material. Matt Salinger tries his best in the lead role but is hampered by cheesy dialogue, a terrible looking costume and limited acting ability. He's not terrible but he lacks the charisma of Chris Evans version. However the film is seriously let down by its action sequences (Pyunh concentrates a lot on close ups and edits). Making an action film on a $3 million budget certainly isn't easy and it comes at a cost!

Pyunh does actually have a semi decent supporting cast including Hollywood names. Ronny Cox, Ned Beatty and Melinda Dillon who give the film a bit of gravitas but it is still a comic book adaptation from the pre-Marvel studios era. And whilst we'd already had well received adaptations of DC characters Superman and Batman by 1990, those had budgets that were 10 times the budget this film has (although the car crash that was Superman IV was also produced by Cannon films).

I'm not saying you should love this film, but take it with a pinch of salt and try and view it through the eyes of a child from 1990, when studios weren't queueing up to make Marvel films. In a way this was one of the first attempts to do so and had a big studio backed it i'm sure it would be more highly thought of. It's a better film than the 1994 version of The Fantastic Four as at least this film feels like people took it seriously. In the15 years after this film the landscape and respect surrounding comic book film adaptations changed dramatically so don't be too harsh on it. And even if i can't convince you otherwise, at least be grateful that Cannon films intended Spider-man movie from 1986 never got made as that would likely have made this film look like Citizen Kane.",5.0,8 December 2021

"Bottom 100 Marathon, Episode II: ""Captain America""","Gee whiz, what a flick! It's so stupid it's almost funny. Almost. But not really. Mostly it's pretty dull, but still somehow quite watchable. The music is fantastically awful in its eightiesness. Who better to play Captain America than Matt Salinger? Yes, you read that right. THE Matt Salinger. What? You've never heard of him? Me neither, and considering his performance in this movie, it's no wonder.

Serious mindf-ck occurs at the very start of the movie. The blue, red and white title ""Captain America"" unceremoniously appears on the screen - but we're in 1936 Italy! Some Italian dialogue makes me wonder if I have accidentally gotten hold of a dubbed copy, but my fears are thankfully never confirmed - although I doubt that the Italian dubbing mafia could've done a worse job at characterization than the American cast. Anyway, we see a little Italian dude playing the piano. Some anonymous military bad guy smashes a window and sends his henchmen to blow Italian dude's parents to pieces. It takes a while before we understand what the hell this has to do with anything - no, it's not a scene from ""The Godfather"" which was accidentally spliced into the film during production - because we quickly cut to:

SEVEN YEARS LATER

(as an afterthought) 1943

World War II is running full throttle and dazed-looking Steve is mugging his way through a tearful farewell to his family and girlfriend, Bernie (and here I was thinking this was a guy's name!). We are treated to such wonderful dialogue as: ""It's just that... I love you and I can't stand thinking that I won't know where you are or what you're doing!"" Sparks fly, chemistry's high (or maybe it's the scriptwriter) and Steve leaves his old neighbourhood... never to return... OR WILL HE?

It turns out Steve signed up for some lab rat work for the accent-ually challenged military. Before he can say ""no paycheck is worth this!"", he's strapped to a chair, attacked by flashing colours, and Captain America is born. There's no time for celebration, however, because an evil nazi bastard shows up and starts peppering everyone with a prop. What I love about this scene is that the military is carrying out this secret, important experiment in the basement of a bar and it's free for anyone to just drop in! Oh, that and the flashy colours, of course.

Captain America is hit and we find out that he's immune to bullets. The accent-ually challenged military guy sends him to stop Red Skull - the Italian dude from the beginning of the movie - a bad guy with a really awful case of acne who thinks the concept of jokes about English lessons is the best thing since spaghetti bolognese. Steve arrives at the bad guy's hideout, some bland action occurs and Captain America shows that he's a complete loser by actually letting this walking advertisement for Clearasil get the better of him. Suddenly strapped to a nuclear missile, Steve grabs hold of Acne Man's wrist and the latter makes the only sensible thing: he uses a knife to slice off... his own hand. That's truly brilliant thinking there, buddy.

Then we cut to a poor child actor telling his mum that he's going to be president of the USA when he grows up (FORESHADOWING!). The kid goes outside for some reason and sees Steve America and the nuclear missile in the sky. This is so inspirational to him that he has to rave about it to his blonde-haired snob of a friend, who touches his shoulder in a very disturbing way. I'd just like to point out that this is the WORST CHILD ACTOR I'VE EVER SEEN, EVER! And I've seen The Omen 2006, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, and Stephen King's version of The Shining.

50 or so years pass and - voila! - poor child actor #1 has indeed become president of the United States. A lot of boring stuff happens as Steve America is carved out of a block of really authentic-looking ice in Alaska; meets Bernie who's now supposedly 66 (I must say she ages extremely well!), married and has a seriously hot daughter; and has to cope with the cultural changes of the US since 1943, sort of like in ""Austin Powers"" only less touching. We also find out that Acne Man has magically transformed into Incompetent Plastic Surgery Man (whom I will refer to as IPSM from here on).

Some filler scenes, filmed as an excuse for the cast and crew to go to Italy, ensue until we finally get to the climactic showdown between IPSM and Steve America. Now Steve finds himself in a situation where he has to stop IPSM from blowing up Europe (!), but can't because... I.P.S.M. is armed with a machine gun?? What the hell? I thought he was immune to gunfire? Whatever. My brain hurts now.

I wouldn't want to spoil the film's ending for you so I'll just leave this already too long plot summary now. Add to what I've just said porn movie actors, a very eighties soundtrack, overly ambitious action with none of the budget it needs to not be a complete joke, and Matt Salinger's... um... original performance as the Captain himself, and you have a film which is actually pretty watchable in an F-movie kind of way.

In conclusion: It's exactly stupid and unintentionally silly enough to keep your attention to the bitter end (unlike something like ""Bloodrayne"", whose stupidity bored me to tears) and really all you could ask for from a good bad movie. It's pretty mean to call it one of the 100 worst movies ever. Remind me never to write a review this long again.

Horribly dated.,"This movie is probably a contender for the worst superhero movie ever made, though Elektra or Catwoman would beat it to that dubious honour, or even Supergirl. The costumes in this movie are disappointing, the action scenes are not well filmed at all, the plot of the film is also extremely disappointing and low budget. The movie was released after great movies like Superman and Batman had come out, how this hoped to compete with them I really don't know. The film was surely dated when it came out and looks even more so now. I'm glad we'd had the recent movies so we can now forget about this one.",3.0,5 January 2024
This Captain Will Save America!,"Yes! Another superhero film comes and goes! What I love about these kinds of films are that we have the hero. We have the villain. We have a damsel in distress. Heck, we even have a problem in the world, like a shortage of cows, or that we need help opening a nasty carton of milk! This movie, ""Captain America,"" does all of that. No, there isn't anything in this movie that has to do with cows or opening milk cartons or anything. However, there is the hero, Captain America, and the villain, The Red Skull, and so forth.

""Captain America"" is a superhero movie that may not be as exciting as ""Spider-Man,"" but believe me, if you are lucky enough to find a copy (and they are extremely difficult to come by nowadays!), then you can watch this movie and see what all the buzz is about.",10.0,17 February 2006

For Die Hard Comic Fans Only,"When a summer film gets hyped, then mysteriously gets banished to a direct-to-video release, there's a problem. That's pretty much the backstory for Captain America--hyped as Marvel's answer to Batman in 1990, set to celebrate the character's 50th anniversary, and.........well, just vanished. After a few abortive theatrical release dates, it was snuck into video stores 2 years later. Not that it really mattered, anyone who had any desire to see it got their bootleg copy long ago.

On the bright side, the beginning is pretty good and the end is pretty good. Unfortunately, there's just this hour in between that's rather dull. Steve Rogers is rarely in costume, and spends a lot of the film looking like he had his brain surgery done by the paperboy. Ned Beatty is pretty decent in the film, but after his love scene in Deliverance, anything's a step up for him.

one of the worst superhero films of all time,"So I do the review of captain america 1990 So at the time I didn't know this film at all and neither did the other people in the world until the internet was created So this film had been the beginning of the years90 to make a superhero film given that last year Tim Burton's Batman film was a success and they decided to make Captain America films but I haven't seen the other previous ones so I can't make any comments. And what what do you think of this film My God how bad it isI swear to you, I swear to you, bad films like these can't really be seen, they would always be seen, but not like this type of superhero, I swear to you, because this is truly suffering and it shouldn't have even existed then all the things and I can tell you one thing it doesn't suit me at allI liked the film Justice League of America 1997 but I gave it an extra vote because this Captain America is much worse. So let's talk for a moment about the main character. For me it was a really bad adaptation. He should be the great character of all of America instead. Thethey treated a complete idiot I swear this character is a real idiot worse than Shazam in the second film and so who why because he doesn't realize that he has ended up in another year or that he had been invented a lot of years but he's just an idiot anddo you want to know how he finds out he discovers when his love has become an old woman And let's not talk about the costume someone will say But it was a film from the past To tell the truth It was also disgusting of the time and all the characters are terribly badly written but the tall but the other character she wasbadly adapted it's really the Red Skull I swear this is really worse than the film And then his appearance is really horrible and then he's not even a German he's Italian and then when he appears in the present he has completely changed his appearance therefore bad just worse and then the ultrasoundaction films are really bad and I don't understand why they made a blu-ray edition of this film.

Cannon Captain America,,3.0,3 May 2022
Still Evolving,"Marvel has struggled ever since the end of WWII to make Captain America relevant, and even the.2011 update missed some marks. This 1990 attempt had both pluses and minuses.

Concerning the Red Skull's backstory. Here, it's presented that he is an Italian and the result of Italian fascism. This is grossly irreverent to the generation that saw him as an American icon in opposition to the NAZI regime in Germany, and for reasons unknown they decided to omit that it was Hitler himself who took the Red Skull under his wing (the 2011 rendering failed here as well). This can be considered a goof anyway because for the Red Skull to be a master of espionage during WWII he would have needed to be at least 25 in the mid 1930s, so for him to have been a young boy at the time he began his indoctrination would have meant it started well before the Nazis even came into being; even the comics never explained this.

Captain America's cowl and costume didn't look that great in this one; it seemed rubbery and as though it would tear under the slightest stress. That said, it could have been worse (see the TV movies from the 70s).

All that said, the story itself in this one wasn't awful. They just made some changes from the source material that didn't need to be made considering ""political correctness"" hadn't even happened yet. The casting worked. Given where Cap '90 was for its time, we can expect them to finally get it right about 2035... maybe.",4.0,20 November 2022
Confusing but Amusing,,8.0,22 July 2011
a mixed bag,"This movie is truly a mixed bag.

There are several elements colliding here. On the one hand we have a...yes...ambitious script. The origin story of Captain America, his first mission ending in partial failure (he fails to defeat the red skull but at least manages to avoid the destruction of the white house back in 1943). The culture shock Steve Rodgers has to deal with when he reawakens in the 1990's. A touching scene when he finds his old, dearly and sincerely loved girlfriend as an old woman. The feeling of guilt Captain America has to deal with when he learns that his failure to stop the red skull during WWII indirectly caused the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King. The personal tragedy of bringing danger and death to his old girlfriend's family. And then, as the current president of the united states is kidnapped, Captain America sets out to save the president and finally defeat the red skull...redeeming himself.

It is a big story. But it is hampered by low production value, an uneven direction by ""trash-auteur"" director albert pyun and irritatingly edited action-scenes.

On the other hand there is the strong performance of matt salinger as captain America, playing is part with honest sincerity. Solid performances by Ronny Cox, Ned Beatty and Scott Paulin. And, I think, and endearing and under-appreciated performance by Kim Gillingham in the ""triple"" role of captain America's young and old girlfriend bernice and her daughter sharon.

All in all this movie represents good intentions hampered by a low budget. Take the same script and the same actors and give it a decent budget and a competent director and you would have one of the finest feature films based on a comic book EVER!",6.0,28 May 2011
I liked it.,"Unlike every Superman film staring Christopher Reeves that was ever produced, Captain America is actually watchable. Then again, I have absolutely zero background knowledge of the comic book incarnation so I'm likely being very generous.I liked the fact that he spent most of the film wearing normal clothes. With a costume that ridiculous he needs to. Watching someone who was frozen in the 1940's try to reorient themself into the 1990's, and cope with all the changes that have occurred since, was reminiscent of the movie ""Forever Young"". Perhaps this film's biggest asset, and its biggest failing, was that most of it seemed a lot less comic booky than most comic book movies. Granted the cinematography was pretty low quality for 1992.",,19 September 2000
A re-evaluation of a previous review,"With a new ""Spider-Man"" movie due out this May, an upcoming sequel to ""Blade,"" and ""X-Men 2"" to start filming soon, I thought it would be appropriate to review some of the previous attempts that Marvel Comics has made to get their characters onto the big screen. It's no questions that their films have never been as successful as their arch rivals, DC Comics, especially in the nineties. While there was a successful TV Incredible Hulk series in the seventies, a never-released, low-budget ""Fantastic Four"" flick, and an *ahem* film version of ""The Punisher"" that is not even worthy of mention, at the end of the day, the only cinematic interpretations of their heroes that are worth commenting on at all are ""Blade,"" ""X-Men,"" and ""Captain America.""

In an earlier review, written back in my naive, less-educated-in-Cinema-days, I stated that ""Captain America"" was the greatest super-hero film ever made. This is not a true statement, and it was one I made having not seen the film in a few years, and the flaws were less-apparent in my mind. Yes, there are many flaws in this film: Some of the dialogue is cheezy, many of the characters are underdeveloped, and there is simply not enough time spent with Captain America in costume. However, in the heart of this film there is a very sincere, very respectable tribute to the golden-age superhero, and I feel that the movie is still very much worthy of praise.

Without going too much into detail about the nature of the plot, I will say that it successfully sums up sixty years of comics into one movie. Both the characters of Captain America and his facist counterpart, the Red Skull (brainchild of Hitler in the comics, created by Mussolini and sold to the nazis here) are depicted as much more tragic than in the comics. Both characters are well-constructed and sincerely acted by Matt Salinger and Scott Paulin, and the film is basically a tribute to old 1940's serials with two strong characters taking center stage.

When I say a tribute to 1940's serials, this is exactly what I mean. Every plot point, every character save Cap and the Skull, serve nothing more than to move the story along from action scene to action scene. Many things happen that make little sense- for example, upon being revived in the nineties after being frozen in ice for fifty years, Captain America is found by a conspiracy theorist who has been piecing together his story for years. How does the guy find our hero? He just happens to be driving through Northern Canada and stumbles upon him. Once the Red Skull realizes that Cap is still alive, he determines that the hero must be out to destroy him. Now, Cap has been out of commission for fifty years, and the Red Skull is now a mysterious, Corleone-esque kingpin. In this film, they only encountered briefly in the 1940's before Cap was frozen in ice. Why on earth would Skull jump to the conclusion that hey! Cap is thawed out, and his first objective will be to stop the Red Skull? In another part, realizing that the Skull is hiding in Italy, Cap jumps on a plane fro the U.S. and flies there. Um.....how did he get on board of that plane? Surely his passport wasn't perserved with him in the ice?

But nevermind....these plot holes, and many like them, are irrelavent to what this film is trying to do: Put our hero in a series of spectacular action scenes and watch how he gets out of them. It is not trying to tell a serious story, it is simply trying to give us some silly, comic-book action in a movie-serial kind of way, and the movie does just that. Our hero is strapped to a German rocket headed toward the White House, dodges nazi villians in Northern Canada, is amazed in some cleverly-written scenes how many American products are made in former enemy lands of Japan and Germany, fights the Red Skull's henchmen in Italy, and finally has an explosive showdown with the Skull himself in the kingpin's castle, where the villian threatens to blow up all of Western Europse with an atomic bomb which he receives from a piano. All this combined with the fact that the Skull is responsible for the deaths of JFK, RFK, and Martin Luther King, and now he plans to use a brain transplant to make the new economically-aware U.S. President his slave.

It is impossible to take this film any more seriously than you would take an old serial or a four-part issue of the Cap comic book, and this kind of treatment is exactly what a Captain America movie needed. As a result, the low-budget, occasionally hammy acting, and confusing storytelling only add to the film's effect and heighten director Pyun's well-choreographed action sequences. There is just something grand and, dog-gonnit, patriotic about the President of the United States leaping from a tower in order to keep the Skull from using him in is experiments, only to be successfully caught and saved by Captain America, who is crawling up the wall vigorously. In real life, this would have ripped both their arms out of their sockets, but in this movie, what difference does it make? It's such a well-shot scene!

This said, Cap and Skull are well-developed, and they hold the film together when it threatens to go over-the-top in its comic-book silliness. Cap fights the Skull and fails to defeat him in the 1940's, only to be frozen in ice and thawed out in the nineties, where he learns that, because he failed to defeat the Skull, his arch villian is responsible for the deaths of many historic figures. Feeling he has failed his country, plus realizing his old girlfriend is now old with a family of her own, Cap is a determined, meloncholy hero with nothing to lose. There is a sincerity to the part that Matt Salinger brings, and with his niavity and his boyish-good looks, it looks as if Cap is truly a hero from the 1940's, who has stepped out of his time and into ours and is truly amazed at the changes that have come (though attempts to give him lines featuring old 40's terms such as ""Gee-wizz"" and ""holy mackeral"" don't come off so well). The Red Skull watched the slaughter of his family as a small boy in the 1930's, and this tramautizing event that led to his transformation into the monster he now is has bittered him over the centuries. In a film which emphasized overacting, he probably has the sublest role, yet he still has the film's best over-the-top lines (""Assassination isn't worth the trouble. It took two years to find Sir Hans. Three to find Oswald. The King job alone cost us over twenty two million dollars. What do we get for our troubles? Saints. Martyrs to the cause."") Must like Michael Corleone in the ""Godfather 2"" (though on a much smaller level), in the film's final scenes, he builds himself up as a great, powerful crimelord, but to the viewer, he simply comes across as pitiful.

In the end, ""Captain America"" is a fun, low-budget, patriotic, feel-good action flick which works in a Saturday Matinee sort of way. While never released to theaters here in the U.S., it made the theaters, perhaps ironically, overseas and, as a result, built the bridge for the bigger-budgeted, more-serious Marvel Superhero movies that came years later and are still to come. Certainly worth watching, certainly worth owning, certainly a tribute to sixty years of ""Captain America"" comic books.

Is it a B movie or a C movie?,"The first time I saw anything about this movie was a poster in a magazine. Besides the rubber suit (which should have been more of a light chain mail type thing) the most glaring thing I noticed was that the ears are part of the costume and not the actor's ears at all! This was the first sign of the level of budget we were looking at.

I mean, his ears were rubber, and they got folded up and weren't even fixed for a promotional poster! So, given that we're now rating this on the B movie scale, it really wasn't too bad. It was an enjoyable flick that could easily be replaced by a decent remake, but is on par with the old Captain America movies.

If you're a fan of the older comic book adaptations, you'll enjoy it. It's an above average B movie. I'm glad I own it.",6.0,18 May 2005

An under-rated action romp,"The 1990 Euro-American Captain America really gets a lot of bad press that it doesn't deserve. While it definitely has some flaws, playing fast and loose with some plot points (honestly no more so than the modern Marvel Cinematic Universe), it does stay true to the spirits of its main characters, and includes the same sorts of sly call-backs that those of us raised with RDJ's Ironman and the more modern Cap have since come to expect.

Where the movie really struggles in its budgeting choices, lavish location shots and action sequences definitely thrill the eyes, but the money probably would have been better spent on costumes and lighting/camera quality, where interior shots often come off dark and grainy. (you'll see many reviewers complain about cap's spandex, which compares poorly to Keaton's 1989 Batman, and even Christopher Reeve's final turn as Superman) Another point where the movie probably failed to compete is in tone... it's not quite as dark or as cartoonish as the contemporary 1989 batman, but likewise it's not as comedic or uplifting as the 80's superman movies, making it an awkward fit for audiences of the day expecting one or the other. And its largely European villains and themes would have probably have failed with an American audience had it gotten a US theater release.

But make no mistake, the movie is chock full of good points. By the standards of a 1990 movie, the physical stunts are impressive, relying more on physical talent than on wire-work or camera tricks; and the exotic localities serve to impress the spy-thriller tone of the story very well, giving feel of the dying days of the cold war and European espionage. The cast fit their rolls very well, even when those roles seem a bit ill defined by a script that cuts to different settings quickly with a spy-novel's sensibilities. It has all the flair and bombast you'd expect of a movie written in the late 80s/early 90s action piece with a slight kung-fu twist.

While this flick certainly shows some of its age and budgetary constraints to a sophisticated 21st century audience, it's worth a watch for any fan of capes movies or action film buffs.",7.0,22 August 2015
What could have been the start of a potentially great franchise,"Half-way decent adaptation of the classic Marvel comics character, which many people either love or hate. Most of the half-way decency the film has it derives from star Matt Salinger, the son of over-praised asshole writer JD Salinger. In a role that could have been made comical or just plain bad by many other actors, Matt manages to imbue the character with an authentic feeling of sincerity similar to what Christopher Reeve gave to Superman and often missing from other actors in superhero films. Had this film been left with a bigger budget and gotten a big theatrical release it could very well have made Matt Salinger a star, or at least establish his name and allow him some leverage to pursue other roles in bigger projects like Helen Slater after the endearingly classic disaster ""Supergirl"" (1984). Actually I think both Dolph Lundgren and Arnold Schwarzenegger, respectively, were both considered for this role, but it's just as well that they didn't get it, seeing as how their accents would have worked against them playing this ""All-American"" hero. Although Arnold's name on the picture might have gotten it a theatrical release instead of going direct to video (a similar fate befell Dolph's ""The Punisher"").

After Steve Rogers gets pumped up by the super soldier serum he becomes Captain America and gets into a disastrous first mission that ends with him getting his ass kicked by the Red Skull, who straps him to a missile pointed at the White House. Cap narrowly manages to cut off the Red Skull's hand and wrecks the missile so that instead of hitting the White House it lands in the Arctic and freezes him there, but not before he is spotted by a little boy who grows up to be President Ronny Cox. When Cap thaws out, he finds that much has changed while he's been gone, like his old girlfriend and her now adult daughter. He also finds out that the Red Skull is still alive and still out to conquer the world. Naturally, Captain America catches up with the Red Skull and beats the crap out of him in turn (""Stop calling me your brother!"") before saving the world.

The guy playing the Skull is ineffectual, but he's got a nice looking daughter. Again, the real saving grace here is Matt Salinger's sincere performance as the title character, but even that can only do so much against a weak script and boring villains. Still, I enjoyed this film and I feel that fans deserved a chance to see this in theaters. And now I hear that Brad Pitt wants to play Captain America! Oh the shame...",,20 April 2004
"Cheap and bland, but true to the vision of the source material","This adaptation of Captain America stays true to the vision of the character despite its production and somewhat amateurish appearance. The suit looks cheap, but it's pretty respectful of the suit Steve wears in the comics. Red Skull's makeup is quite bizarre and even terrible. The plot is simple, but good at taking elements from the character in the comics. Steve Rogers' story arc is well embodied and is an acceptable adaptation. Sure it's a simple action movie of the period with a tempered violence, but it manages to be entertaining. It is by no means one of the worst Marvel adaptations, although its quality is unprofessional. Marvel failed in trying to bury this movie and it is a film that deserves to be known by Marvel fans. My rating for this movie is 8/10.",8.0,24 March 2023
Not as bad as some say,"I guess we can get the bad out of the way; the production is very cheap, the hero's costume and the makeup on the main villain (and a few other important characters) are not very convincing. The plot is more than a little condensed from the source material, which makes Captain America seem like a not very good hero. Even a short montage of his exploits in World War II could have helped set him up as a better hero. Also a lot of the cast really overact. The Good: Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty DO NOT simply phone in their performances, and they carry their scenes exceptionally well. Matt Salinger, as the titular Captain America and his altar ego, does have an ""aw shucks"" likability that helps him fit into the ""All American"" nature of the character. The script does not give him much to work with, but he is likeable and sells the ""man out of time"" aspect really well. Lastly, despite being mostly shot in Yugoslavia, the filming manages to sell a variety of locations very well. The silly fun: some of the editing and special effects will illicit (presumably unintentional) laughs, and those laughs will up the enjoyability factor. Despite some actors' overacting not being very good, Darren McGavin and Scott Paulin are both clearly having a blast playing deliciously evil characters. On the whole, Captain America 1990 is not a great film, but it is enjoyable. And if you are in the right mood, will make for a fun Tuesday night in front of the TV.",6.0,3 March 2020

Better than Previous Captain America Movies... But that's not saying much.,"This movie was made in the early 90s before Marvel had a true understanding of how to make a good transition between comic and screen.

(A great improvement over previous movies where the Captain America Character had nothing to do with the Comic Version (see the 70's era movie with the Captain with the clear plastic Shield.)

This is a piece of fluff and a step in the right direction.

Not bad,"Despite its forgotten status today - especially in the wake of the recent mega-budget revamp - CAPTAIN America isn't bad for what it is, which is a low budget, cheesy, superhero family adventure film. Okay, so the director is Albert Pyun, who I have to say is one of my least favourites, and the paucity of budget is evident throughout, but other than that this is surprisingly watchable.

I think it's fair to say that Matt Salinger is one of the more wooden superhero actors to be seen on screen, but the supporting cast makes up for that. THE HIDDEN's Michael Nouri shows up as a military man, good old Ronny Cox is the President no less, Ned Beatty ISN'T a bad guy, and there's even a part for TV's one time Kolchak, Darren McGavin.

It's a fast paced little movie that takes in Steve Rogers' origins, sends him through time to the modern day and then involves him in a plot involving an old enemy. Not much of it makes too much sense, but there's plenty of action and scenes of our hero battling the bad guys.

Silly Ploy to Capitalize on Super-Hero Craze of Early-1990s.,"A movie that is little more than a quick fix to capitalize on the enormous success that ""Batman"" had two years before this film's release, ""Captain America"" is a really silly production that uses some exotic locales to make up for a lack of a suitable screenplay and invisible direction. Matt Salinger is dull in the titled role and he gets no support from ""Deliverance"" alums Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty who both must have been desperate for work and money when they were approached with this project. The titled character comes to life during World War II but immediately gets frozen and meets up once again with the evil Red Skull in the present-day after nearly 50 years of inactivity.

Not bad at all,"Given enhanced strength and stamina, sickly Steve Rogers became Second World War hero Captain America, but apparently died at the hands of the Nazis. However, over 40 years later, just as the US President comes under threat from a mysterious conspiracy, a frozen body returns to life in the wilds of Alaska - and a legend lives again!

Having read mostly negative reviews of this film, I expected a stinker, but to my surprise I quite enjoyed it, finding it well-paced, with sporadic amounts of well-staged action sequences (real physical stuntwork with no high wire or CGI) and a very sincere performance from Matt Salinger as Captain America. He captures that all American, lost in another era confusion very well, probably better than Chris Evans.

However, with all that said, there are some weak moments such as some dodgy dialogue and underdeveloped characters/plot points. Red skull's daughter and her gang are inept and not at all menacing. I like this version of Red Skull, even though he's Italian, and he's got some cracking dialogue; he's a very suave, menacing.

Matt Salinger plays the red white and blue super soldier who must fight the red skull ( Scott Paulin ) Also on hand is an impressive cast Ronny Cox , Ned Beatty , Micheal Nouri , Melinda Dillon and Bill Mummy. Stan Lee was an executive producer.the special effects are not that great by todays standards. The movie was directed by Albert Pyan and produced by méneheim Golan. I enjoyed this movie and gone it 7 stars.",7.0,14 June 2023
A MISSED OPPORTUNITY,"Whilst I was a fan of Captain America as a child I can not say that I enjoyed either this film or the previous Captain America movie (made in the late 70's).

This film wasn't too bad and it did have it's moments but it just left you feeling dissatisfied once it finished.

There was not enough action in this film. There was action at the beginning and the end but the middle parts were very low on action. I think all good movies should have a plot but we need action as well.

The 1970's Captain America movies were better than this. The only reason I wasn't too keen on them was because they totally changed Captain America in them. His origin had changed, his costume was different, everything was different. Before I saw this film in the early 1990's I had high hopes. After watching this I felt really disappointed that the filmmakers had got it wrong again.

Some superheroes are badly portrayed on the big screen but only usually once. There are three Captain America films to my knowledge and whilst they are passable in their own ways they are not anything to get excited about.

I wouldn't recommend this film to any Captain America fans as they will probably be disappointed like me. Check out The Punisher (1990) starring Dolph Lungdren instead.",,22 March 2002
Endlessly cheap in almost every regard,"When a Nazi scientist defects during the war she tells tales of a process by which a child was turned into a super soldier, albeit with some rather nasty side-effects. She is funded to continue her work and when the time comes, US soldier Steve Rodgers volunteers and himself is transformed. Unfortunately a spy kills the scientist, who never wrote any of this down, so Steve is now the only one of his kind the Allies will have. He is dispatched to Germany to stop a missile being aimed at the White House. Once there he is stopped in his tracks by his opposite number  the Red Skull  tied to the missile and fired with it. He manages to divert it at the last minute but crashes into the North Pole and is frozen. Fifty years later he is discovered and, while much has changed, the need for a hero is still the same as the Red Skull continues to conduct evil in the shadows.

As if proof were needed, Captain America is proof that one cannot trust the child version of one's self when it comes to remembered opinion. Whether it is a forming sense of what is ""good"" or the warm glow of nostalgia, it is common for things to seem better when you watched them as a child only to discover that they were rubbish when you look at them with adult eyes. I have only seen Captain America once and it was on the BBC and I'm pretty sure it was dropped into the schedules as an unbilled replacement for something else. I barely remember the film and literally have only a few images and scenes in my head but, over time, somehow I have formed the opinion that the film was OK  nothing that good but certainly OK.

Well, if I could go back and slap my 14 year-old self then I would because this film is far from being OK, really far from it. Everything about it screams out how cheaply it was made  not just in financial terms but also in regards the emotional care and attention given it. The plot is basic and feels empty, like a four-sentence treatment was stretched out rather than developed. It never engages but it does produce plenty of small fights. Sadly these are mostly awful, lacking any intensity or reason to care and they add to the feeling that nobody really had much idea what to do with this other than churn it out. It is also hard to ignore how ugly a film it is because in terms of cinematography this is a real dog. It has no colour and it looks drab and flat throughout, with murky film and a real ""point-and-shoot"" sense about it.

The cast are mostly poor, partly due to them but in their defence their material is consistently horrid so who could work with that? Salinger is wooden but not in a fun way, but in a ""charisma black hole"" way. He seems sincere but that is part of the problem. Paulin at least seems to know that there is no way to play his character straight so he hams his Italian flamboyance and accent like no tomorrow; still no good but at least he gives the thing some life. Gillingham is pretty but she is really poor throughout the film and you cannot blame the material for her lack of charisma or chemistry with the others. Beatty, Cox and McGavin are strange finds, all of whom play like pros but should have known better.

Captain America is a stinker  everyone says it and everyone is right. It is an ugly film that might have been forgivable in the 1970's but when you consider it was released in 1990 it just makes it all the worse. To work on a low budget it should have taken a look at Flash Gordon and gone for camp fun but instead it settles for being a drab, dull and roundly poor film that feels cheap in almost every regard (script, acting, directing, cinematography etc etc) and deserves every bad thing said about it.",,29 December 2008
"The Red Skull, lol...","The Red Skull was my favorite part of this movie, just because of how funny the makeup looks. This version of Red Skull is my favorite as I just cannot stop laughing when I see it.

The Captain America of this movie is boring, though, nothing interesting going on with him.",6.0,27 April 2022
Can't live up to the promise of its first 25 minutes,"I was a superhero fan growing up, but I somehow never knew this film existed. I heard about it in recent years, probably around the time Marvel Studios was producing CAPTAIN_AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER (2011) for its shared cinematic universe. From what I heard, this 1990 version was a joke. But as I watched it, I was surprised to find that this is a legitimate Marvel Comics movie. Or at least it starts that way. In fact, the story of Captain America's origin (breezed through in a matter of minutes) is rather similar to the version that plays out in the 2011 film. This 1990 film keeps the retro WWII origin for Cap and the star-spangled costume is right out of the comics. The plot moves along rather briskly, and admittedly there are some cheesy scenes, but the first twenty-five minutes of the movie feel like a pulpy comic book brought to life. And in 1990, that's probably what they were going for.

Matt Salinger plays Steve Rogers, who volunteers for a top-secret government experiment to create super soldiers from the physically weak. He's not a scrawny kid like in THE FIRST AVENGER, but rather a strapping young man who suffers from polio and walks with a limp. The experiment turns Rogers into Captain America, the Allied secret weapon against Hitler and his own super soldier, the gruesome Red Skull (an Italian this time around, not a German). On his first mission, Captain America heroically foils the Nazis' plot to bomb the White House, but is consequently lost in the frozen North. Thawed out several decades later, Cap is called upon to ferret out the still-living Red Skull and rescue the President.

Cap's 1940s sweetheart is not Agent Peggy Carter, but Bernie, a girl from his hometown. He returns to find she has married and grown old, but she has a pretty blonde daughter named Sharon (a nod to Sharon Carter of the comics, no doubt). Sharon tags along with Steve as he tracks the Red Skull back to his native Italy.

Disappointingly, the movie as a whole doesn't live up to its first twenty-five minutes. There's a long section in the second half where Steve Rogers does his sleuthing without the costume, and there's nothing really Captain America-y going on. If they were gonna make one Captain America movie and have it stand alone in representing the character on the big screen, they should've had the guy wear the costume more. Otherwise the film becomes a generic action flick.

And while Red Skull is a brand-name comic book villain, his present-day incarnation in this film is a big letdown. Decades removed from his red-skulled WWII treachery, the evil mastermind has undergone plastic surgery to cover up his deformity as he lives quietly in his Italian fortress. With his slicked-back hair and tailored suits, the Red Skull looks like any generic mob boss.

It becomes obvious that CAPTAIN_AMERICA (1990) is a low-budget affair, not the Hollywood blockbuster that we've come to expect from superhero movies these days. The photography of the climactic action scenes in Italy looks almost amateurish. The cast seems fairly obscure today, although real-deal character actors Ned Beatty and Darren McGavin lend support, and Melinda Dillon has a scene as Steve Rogers's mother.

There are several points where the movie seems to be on the right track (there's a touching scene between Steve and Bernie, reunited after fifty years), but it somehow loses its way. (Reading up on the film, it seems some character development from the original script was cut from the final edit.) And the film oddly tries to carry a half-hearted environmentalist message, even urging the audience to support the Environmental Protection Act of 1990 in the end credits.

CAPTAIN_AMERICA (1990) is a strange movie.

depends on what you expect,"This one is truly awful, but if you are in the right state of mind, the ludicrous plot, the crappy special FX and the fact that both Cap and The Red Skull don't wear their trademark costumes/make-up for most of the movie will have you howling with laughter. And let's not forget the ""I'm sick, pull over"" trick Captain America (walking around with his shield in a giant bag) uses twice to steal a car.

In short, if you're into faithful adaptations of comics and superheroes, avoid Albert Pyuns travesty like the plague, but if you are into enjoying crappy movies, go find it. And pick up a copy of 'Nick Fury, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.' as well.",,21 October 2003
Is a waste of film!!!,"I disliked the movie because its small budget ruined all chances to have BIG, epic-scale action. The screenwriter admittedly was no fan of superhero stories, and it's evident. Captain America gets into more action OUT of costume than he does IN costume.",,28 December 1998
This is da bom! Er.. I mean a bomb,"From the director who brought you such timeless classics as ""Nemesis"", ""Nemesis 2"", ""Nemesis 3"", ""Nemesis 4"", and ""Brain Smasher...A Love Story"" - comes the movie - you will wish was never made....

Captain America!

Wow, what were they thinking here, huh??? I can't believe that not one person, not one lowly gaffer or key grip, way in the back, spoke up and said, ""hey...what are we doing??...this movie sucks!""

I mean they must have tried extra hard to make this movie this bad. The acting, directing, plot, make up, everything about this movie is bad. You thought Batman IV was bad? Not even close to this movie, my friends!

To give you an idea of how bad this movie is, even Dolph Lundgren (of ""Punisher"" and ""Masters of the Universe""), who was originally rumored to be cast in the title role, balked at this awful film.

Sucks as a Movie but great as a comic book,"Problably the defining story that ever Featured Captain America was that the Avengers found him floating in an Ice Cube, so the Movie was pretty fidel to the book. But the crappiness of this movie shows why you shouldn't be fidel to the book (like Harry Potter)",,1 February 2004
Does he do childrens parties though.,"In what has to be the greatest anti-communist comic hero of all time, Captain American made his most recent transition to film in this instantly forgettable 1992 straight to video release. Not since the early 70's (the proverbial golden age of really bad movies) has there been a film that delves to the bottom of the barrel in an effort to scrape out what is left quite like this film does.

Captain America seems like it was doomed to fail long before the opening credits ran. The feature was plagued with Legal Red Tape when parent studio 21st Century films went under shortly after this film was in the can. It was shelved for 2 years before finally being released to video. If your wondering, yes they are same group who are also mostly responsible for the legal fiasco that helped hold up work on the much touted never seen James Cameron Spiderman project. With far too much of Old Cap's (Matt Salinger) time spent walking around bewildered in this part action, part fish out of water tale. Matt Salinger turns in an Ernest and honest performance given the nature of the roll there really isn't any room for him to flex his acting muscles. Ronny Cox (Robocop, Total Recall) plays the President, that needs rescuing, but given the high cheddar content of his lines and the patriotic condescending monologues that he is forced to run with I say, let the terrorists keep him he's no good to us. Ronny obviously had car repayments due when he signed on the dotted line for this little piece of cinema slop. Scott Pauline phones in his performance for the make up heavy Red Skull and just spouts of cliché after cliché. The only thing that kept me from turning it off and setting fire to the tape (in an effort to protect the delicate minds of my nations youth) was the occasional action sequence which weren't bad, and as a result kick started pace wee bit. It's just a real shame there weren't more of them. Despite a promising intro the action pieces it fails to regain the momentum, despite director Albert Pyuns (Cyborg) best intentions (and there must have been a few) the film falls flat on its face, scene after agonizing scene. I suspect with some half decent management on this title, a modest and reasonable Captain America film could have been produced. Nothing like some cheap hack and slash film making to make a couple of bucks when you're in receivership I guess.

You can Consider yourself duly warned so rent/buy (if someone hasn't stolen it for use in satanic ritual as this is pretty much all its good for) and watch at your own peril. Only seasoned die-hard Captain America fans will truly appreciate it, if only for the occasional moment when he is doing superhero like stuff. The rest of the time they too will be reaching for the straight razor to put an end to the madness.",,10 September 2001
Please...remake this and make it better!!!,"I first found out this was on TV while I was away on vacation so I had my brother tape it for me. He warned me that the film was pretty bad. And well, after seeing it, I liked it the first time, but as I watched it again and again, I felt distraught. I was realizing what a bad film this was. The only thing I liked about the film was the costume and the original Red Skull makeup. How can you have Cap be frozen for 45 years only to come back as a moron and the Red Skull looking like Jigsaw (one of the main villains in the Punisher comic book). A sad effort.

However, I heard Marvel planning to do something new with Cap. Let it be a better version of a live action film than this and give it the story it deserves to have...heck, add Bucky to the new version. It does better justice than this one.",,16 April 2002
Funny for the wrong reasons.,"I couldn't believe they made this movie so badly, plotholes the size of mountain passes, terrible special defects and atrocious acting: ""ahh, my american brozzer haz arrived"". Actually, I quite enjoyed laughing at it.",,2 February 1999
Ugh,"Matt Salinger makes a passable Captain America, but the movie itself is a real dog. Cap is on the trail of the Red Skull, who somehow has become an Italian. The film is talky and poorly acted, the action laughable. Salinger spends more time in street clothes than his Cap costume. This film is more like a poor man's James Bond flick than a superhero film, and clearly was shot on a minuscule budget. What could Stan Lee have been thinking? All you have to know is that Z-Grade director Albert Pyun directed this schlock. Skip it. (The previous Captain America film, shot back in 1979, is even worse. As Cap, Reb Brown wears a motorcycle outfit and helmet, and carries a small plastic shield that looks like somebody's forgotten umbrella.)",,25 July 2011
A Total Piece of Cap,,,27 August 2003
"Fourth time's the charm, right?","Wrong!!!!!! Oh, man get out your hip boots to wade through this excrement of a film.

I waited in anticipation for this film, back in the day. Stan Lee was talking it up, it was going to have the Red Skull, and the beginning was going to be set in WWII. Imagine my disappointment when I saw a still of Matt Salinger in the costume; his ears are rubber!!!!!! This didn't bode well and it sums up the movie so well.

This film is part of the 90's Marvel Triumvirate; Punisher and Fantastic Four being the other two parts. Marvel always licensed their properties on the cheap and these were the few results that materialized. Thank god they were all that materialized!

Let's begin with the star, Matt Salinger. His sole claim to fame was a famous father, J.D. Salinger. That's nice, but that doesn't mean he could act; and he couldn't. His scenes are excruciating to watch. He has all of the presence of tapioca.

Next the villain, the Red Skull; at least for five minutes! Then, he becomes the Caucasian Skull. Scott Paulin was little more than an extra in The Right Stuff and here we find out why. And who's stupid idea was it to make him Italian? The Skull is a Nazi, for crying out loud! The Fascists were pikers in comparison. The Skull's accent is about as threatening as Mr Rodgers.

The film starts out fine, in WWII, but gets the heck out of there fast. Then we are stuck with the boring fish-out-of-water second act, and Cap-out-of-costume nonsense. Why is it that Hollywood thinks super hero comics will make great films, and then do everything to keep the super hero out of the film? Anyway, we get a bunch of nonsense involving a bland President who was saved by Cap as a kid, a boring love interest, and the Caucasian Skull. Feh!

Albert Pyun is a name that should be wiped from cinematic history. I have seen two of his films and they were 12 too many! At least, they felt like 12 bad films. He must have had some kind of secret info to get great actors like Ned Beatty, Ronnie Cox and Darren McGavin in this mess. At least Bill Mumy has an excuse as a comics fan.

Do yourself a favor: read the Captain America comics, see X-Men or Superman, but avoid this film at all costs!",,8 January 2003
"I don't usually walk out of a movie, but ...","Obviously, this movie was hastily thrown together on the heels of the revitalized Batman franchise. I believe it began with the best of intentions, but we all know where best intentions lead. Anyway, Captain America went direct to video rather than to theatrical release. That should have been my first clue. But even so, I was willing to give it a go. So I endeavored (sometimes in vain) to remain conscious during the movie.

The characters and relationships were as poorly developed as the plot. There was no arc for any of the characters. The action and special effects were equally choppy. Example: one minute Cap is in a punch-up with the Red Skull. The next he is effortlessly subdued and tied to a rocket bound for Washington D.C. Talk about potentially giving Americans a complex. That Cap prevented the missile from hitting D.C. by shear force of will was almost as ridiculous as the scientist surviving the plunge during her escape from the fortress.

The conflict between Cap and the Red Skull was not believable and the Red Skull was more moronic than menacing. Why would he show any loyalty to a regime that gunned down his entire family before his eyes? Also, if Batman deserved a molded mask and Kevlar armor, why not Cap? I realize it was 1936, but if they could turn Steve Rodgers into the ultimate super soldier, couldn't they at least give him a better looking uniform? After all he represents the pride, glory and fighting spirit of America. It made me long for the days of Reb Brown and his cheesy motorcycle helmet/mask. Cap deserves better.

I was really looking forward to this movie, but was sorely disappointed. By contrast, the unfairly maligned Punisher was both comparatively and empirically far superior. By the way, none of this is Matt Salinger's fault. He became Steve Rodgers, but he was not given enough dialogue or an opportunity for character development and to neither make a credible transition to Captain America, nor to develop the duality (e.g., the Clark Kent/Superman dichotomy). Maybe it may have turned out better if Captain America were ""Made In Japan."" Although Marvel redeemed itself with X-Men and will hopefully continue to do so with the much anticipated Spider-Man, this Captain America made me almost want to emigrate to Canada.",,10 February 2002
A waste of film!,"I remember looking forward to this movie's release back in 1992. There was even a poster up under the coming soon section at the theater. Well, a few years passed and it never came. One afternoon it came on cable and I finally got to see it. I wish I hadn't. The first ten minutes or so were good and then it went downhill from there. It was slow, boring, and had lousy special effects. Even the Oval Office looked ridiculous. Please, if you value your time, never watch this poor excuse for a movie!",,30 December 2000
Stan Lee Will Spend Eternity in the Pit,"This film is a slap in the face to all fans of Captain America. Instead of a super-soldier with a heart of gold, we get Li'l Abner wrapped in an ill-fitting flag. Captain America's glorious background fighting Nazis is rinsed away as he's defeated out of the gate. The Red Skull is transformed from a nightmare vision of evil into a sensitive Mafioso. This movie ended up being so thoroughly weak that no attempt was made to give it a theatrical release. If only they'd destroyed all the prints and negatives before letting it hit TV and VHS!",,16 August 1999
oh good lord- trite sh***,"this gut wrenchingly bland, unimaginative and tedious 'film' almost put the kybosh on any comic/graphic novel ever being translated onto celluloid. I yearned to see this and finally found it on TV at some god-awful time of the day. Settling down with beer to enjoy something that should at least be enjoyable on a 'cheese' factor level I'm afraid I gave up after about half and hour. That's an all time best- comfortably surpassing 'Malice' and the Karate Kid films. So little money, such a poor script. Only the Schumacher/Schwarzeneggar (sp?) batman fiasco has been worse for a comic book. DON'T watch this film- it's not 'so bad it's good' it's just bad.",,26 May 2006
Not even a double dose of super soldier serum could've saved the Star Spangled Avenger...,"If you looked up ""straight-to-video film"" in Webster's dictionary, you'd see the box cover to the disastrous Captain America, a film that not only strays away from Kirby and Simon's legendary comic book character, but also is a simple and concise failure.

The plot is ridiculous, even for a comic book movie, and the idea to make the villainous Red Skull an Italian, as opposed to a German everyman, is a major inconsistency in the the history of the character. Matt Salinger, son of author J.D. Salinger, is barely passable as the good Captain, but is neither physically imposing or strikingly handsome enough to appear as the Sentinel of Liberty. Secondary characters, including Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox as the President of the U.S., are boring, poorly written, and really not necessary.

Scott Paulin's turn as the Red Skull is also really hokey, and who came up with the idea that he should have extensive plastic surgery? The guy is called the Red Skull for God's sake!

The dialogue is lacking on pretty much every level, and the action sequences are short and fall flat. As for Cap's indestructible shield, who thought up of the ridges? At least it is not as bad as the clear, plastic number featured in the two forgettable TV movies featuring Reb Brown (who is more physically capable as Cap, but has that ""dumb-as-a-brick"" look on his face).

Don't pick up this movie. Avoid it all costs. Pick up the comic, especially from the Roger Stern era or the late Mark Gruenwald's issues. You'll have a better time, and it'll probably be cheaper.",,5 February 1999

Modest adaptation,"My review was written in June 1992 after watching the film on video cassette.

Shelved for over two years, ""Captain America"" is released direct-to-video as a strictly routine superhero outing.

Menahem Golan produced the picture in Yugoslavia in 1989 and sold it to Columbia the following year. Posters for its theatrical release went up in Manhattan, but the film never showed up, though it would have made passable Saturday matinee fodder.

Following a 1944 serial, Reb Brown toplined in two TV movies of the comic strip hero a decade ago, and Matt Salinger ably embodies his all-American spirit here. Film opens in 1936 where experiments by Italian scientist result in a boy with superhuman strength, named Red Skull.

Seven years later the Allies are working with emigree Italian scientist Carla Cassula to develop a regiment of U. S. superheroes. Only one test subject emerges, Salinger, who's christened Captain America. He loses a battle with Red Skull (in which CA's shield is thrown like a Frisbee) and is launched by rocket to destroy the White House.

Salinger is able to veer off course and lands in Alaska where he remains frozen in ice until the present day. Unthawed, he whips into action to prevent an evil U. S. general (Darren McGavin) plotting with Red Skull to control the U. S. president (Ronny Cox) with a brain implant device.

Sallinger has some good moments dealing with the cultural shock of his Rip Van Winkle reawakening, but the film never takes flight under Albert Pyun's leaden direction. (Pyun was earlier set to direct a film of Marvel's popular ""Spiderman"" character, but that was not yet realized.) Under heavy makeup, Scott Paulin makes little impression as the pic's villain Red Skull. Pretty heroine Kim Gillingham and Italian femme fatale Francesca Neri (as Red Skull's daughter) provide decorative touches.

Pic is already quite dated, as McGavin and Paulin plan to blame everything on the nasty Soviets. Photogenic locations and cheap chase and action sequences do not hide the fact that this fantasy adventure is missing the large-scale set pieces to which action fans in the age of Schwarzenegger have become accustomed.",,21 July 2023
