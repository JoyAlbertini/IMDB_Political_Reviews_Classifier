Brilliant Dramedy With a Shocking Finale,"Do The Right Thing is perhaps the best case study of racism ever made. Some people claim that the film perpetuates black stereotypes. Some people don't think. The black people in Do The Right Thing, like the white, Hispanic, and Korean people) exhibit all the unfounded fear and rage that stems from racism. The only truly stereotypical black man in the film is portrayed as an idiot. Buggin' Out sets the whole thing in motion because he is outraged that the local Italian-American pizza man Sal doesn't have any pictures of African-Americans on his wall. He spends the rest of the film trying to gain support for a boycott of Sal's. The rest of the predominately black neighborhood rightly views him as an idiot.

Spike Lee himself plays Mookie, the closest thing to a protagonist in the film. Mookie is a lazy delivery boy at Sal's who has a girlfriend and a baby that he doesn't support. Samuel L. Jackson plays the local DJ who is ultimately the voice of reason in the film. There are a slew of backup characters, nearly all of whom play important roles. Radio Raheem, Da Mayor, Sal's sons, Jade, and many others are vital to the film.

If I had to guess why some people don't like this film, I would say it's due to the fact that there are no good guys. There aren't even any bad guys. There is no one to root for because everyone is guilty. Spike Lee's magnum opus examines the deterioration of characters incredibly. You can feel the characters wearing thin as the hot day drags on and tension mounts. The only flaw of the film is that the subplot of Mookie's relationship with Tina flip-flops, but even that is for a purpose. Don't let the handful of vocal naysayers keep you from watching this indie masterpiece.",9.0,26 October 2007
"Creative, but definitely not flawless","It's sometimes difficult to separate artists' public statements from the work they're commenting on, or to ignore the politically charged aura a film generates. There's always that nagging feeling that a movie's point must be sussed out, that the real intentions of the filmmaker must be understood. But in retrospect--and despite director Spike Lee's rhetoric--Do the Right Thing may not be as profound as previously thought. While it should be applauded for taking on the subject of race without Hollywood's usual heavy-handedness, simply presenting a topic doesn't automatically mean anything is actually being said about that topic.

Whatever problems there are with the content, Do the Right Thing is still great film-making. It's a vibrant, passionate, funny movie, and like a true work of art, it both surprises and provokes. It's technically audacious and features one of the most successful displays of stifling, suffocating heat ever put on film.and it does it without being languid itself. The dialogue is fast paced, the characters energetic, and the camera-work unpredictable, full of clever pans and Twilight Zone angles. And, except for the always excruciating Martin Lawrence, the performances are uniformly good throughout. Lee also manages to out-Altman Altman by presenting a large cast of characters without it ever becoming confusing or disjointed.

Taking place over the course of one scorching day in Bedford-Stuyvesant, most of the action occurs in and around a pizzeria run by Sal (Danny Aiello) and his sons Pino and Vito (John Turturro, Richard Edson). But the entire neighborhood is featured as the film intercuts between various exchanges, many of them tinged with racial overtones: while Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito) challenges a white tenement owner when he feels slighted, down the street three men debate the right of a Korean to own a variety store in ""their"" neighborhood.

There are personal moments as well: Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) continually attempts to soften Mother Sister's (Ruby Dee) opinion of him, while Mookie (Lee) juggles time between his job at Sal's and his increasingly aggravated girlfriend (Rosie Perez). Although Lee doesn't have the time to make all his characters three-dimensional, he avoids sentimentalizing or demonizing any one group; there are both blacks and whites who are sympathetic (Sal, Da Mayor) and troublesome (Pino, Radio Raheem). Only the Korean storeowner played by Steven Parks is a blatant caricature. (Asians seem to get short shrift no matter who is behind the camera.) Presiding over the action is disc jockey Senor Love Daddy (Samuel L. Jackson). Like Wolfman Jack in American Graffiti, he provides ongoing background music, as well as periodic commentary.

Eventually, the heat and personal tensions culminate in an explosion of violence centered on Sal's pizzeria. The violence escalates after one of the characters is killed. It's at this point that the film becomes problematic. The murder is supposed to be a tragedy, meant to provoke outrage in the audience. But the killing of a fictional character isn't enough in itself to warrant a reaction. It's not that audiences are jaded, but drama usually elicits judgement based on the narrative alone. If a character is a jerk, his death won't elicit much of a response. Like Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, Do the Right Thing relies too heavily on the personal baggage audiences are supposedly bringing to the film. Drawing on contemporary events and feelings may be provocative, but it dates the film and makes for poor drama. The reactions of Mookie and Mother Sister to the murder may have been understandable to a disenfranchised group, but in the context of the plot they appear unmotivated, almost random.

The somewhat ambiguous nature of the movie could easily be trumpeted as a selling point. Lee doesn't want to hold your hand; he wants you to make up your own mind. But there is a fine line between ""bravely ambiguous"" and ""maddeningly directionless."" While Oliver Stone continually has been pilloried for his blatantly didactic films, there is something to be said for being recklessly personal and taking a stand. Lee made a movie about racism; but we're so starved for challenging works, for thematically mature movies, we've embraced a film that ultimately says nothing more than ""racism is bad"" and ""no one person or group is to blame.""

The simplistic ideals of Do the Right Thing are most evident in four scenes: 1) Love Daddy lists practically every major black musician from the last fifty years; 2) in an overly contrived sequence, Mookie gets Pino to admit that his cultural heroes are all black (Magic Johnson, Eddie Murphy, and Prince); 3) Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson and Louis Farrakhan are all mentioned; 4) the words ""Tawana Told the Truth"" appear spray painted on a wall (a reference to the Tawana Brawley controversy of 1987). No differentiation is made between the listed artists, and no context is given for the black leaders mentioned. These aren't explorations of racially-charged issues, it's just name dropping.

Despite its flaws, Do the Right Thing provokes discussion. It's an impossible film to dismiss. Spike Lee's subsequent career has turned out to be a disappointment, but Do the Right Thing, along with Malcolm X, represent Lee at his creative peak.",7.0,22 June 2006
Do the Right Thing (1989),,7.0,10 May 2011
There it is..... Love and Hate,"90% of Spike Lee's masterpiece Do the Right Thing is a perfectly developed character study of a wide range of model personalities who all happen to be in Bedford-Stuyvesant on the hottest day of the summer. What the other ten percent consists of you will have to discover for yourself.

This ingenious film explores extremes, but never gives itself over to stereotypes as its plot cleverly navigates through the politics of inner city life and the struggles of American racism. As an artful and intelligent examination of the ethics of violence and prejudice, Do the Right Thing is unparalleled. It implies a simple profound question - what is the 'right thing'? But steadfastly refuses to supply even a hint of an answer - appropriately leaving its central point entirely up to its audience. Instead, the film points to a different, perhaps more important question ""Whose version of right is right for you?"" There are a lot of good people, a lot of bad people, and a very realistic majority of people who are usually somewhere in the middle but also somewhat confused throughout this film. African American, Latino, East Asian and Italian American cultures form the dynamics of the relationships that drive the story, and conflict is their medium. Drawing from two incisive but different comments on violence from Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, Lee extrapolates his story and the ideas he wants to explore by showing us characters that are as real as they are exaggerated and somewhat unpredictable events that they create, are swept into or actively or passively participate in. Although the point of the film is not really critique, nobody is left unscathed.

I am not going to tell you what the film says - I can't, because it is, more than most films dealing in such a direct manner with the subject of race, open to interpretation. And what you bring to it will influence, but not determine what you take away from it. It is just that powerful.

Instead, I will simply give Do the Right Thing my highest recommendation.

Superbly written, edited, directed and filmed. Well acted (Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, Giancarlo Esposito, Rosie Perez, Spike Lee and Richard Edson really stood out for me) and very nicely soundscaped, Do the Right Thing is the perfect film for a solitary night of reflection or for sharing with an intelligent group of friends. However, be forewarned, the film hits hard, and will disturb some people a great deal - especially those who feel a need for closure and resolution.",10.0,28 February 2008
"That's the double-truth, Ruth","In all likelihood Spike Lee's most important achievement - as director, writer and actor (though to my taste Mo' Better Blues is just as good a picture) and one of the strongest films you'll see about race relations, 'Do The Right Thing' looks dated at times, but it lost none of its impact and relevance. The movie takes place in a particularly hot day in a primarily African-American neighborhood in Brooklyn, and follows the various personalities who live there throughout the day; the center of the story is Sal's Famous Pizzeria - its owners, some of the few white people living in the neighborhood: Sal (Oscar nominated performance for Danny Aiello) and his two sons (John Torturro and Richard Edson), and Mookie (Spike Lee himself), the black delivery boy. What starts out as a light, entertaining movie with some amusing characters and light humor, gradually builds up tension to the point of being unbearable, up to the dramatic and tragic climax. Spike doesn't put as much emphasis on the characters themselves as he does on the relationships and the tension between them; and in this image of a very specific and small frame in time and place, makes a strong and important message about racism and race relations in general. The film is populated with many different characters, all of them very memorable and each one a representative of a certain belief, mode of behavior or state of mind - on both sides of the conflict. From the uninhibited anger of Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito) and Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) on one side and Pino (John Torturro) on the other side, to Jade (Joie Lee, Spike's sister in the film and in real life) and Vito (Richard Edson), who are trying to connect and live at peace with the other side, to Da Mayor (Ossie Davis), in his isolated but peaceful state of mind, living in complete peace with the world around him, and Smiley (Roger Smith), living in his own isolated existence. Then there's Mookie, who is stuck in the middle, torn between his commitment and responsibilities to both sides. Finally we have Mister Senor Love Daddy - played gorgeously by the one and only Samuel L. Jackson, in one of his finest performances - half active character and half all-knowing narrator - who represents the voice of reason in the conflict, the reason which is bound, ultimately, to collapse. Each and every character plays an important part in the climatic and dramatic conflict to which the movie builds up, and though it's the radical ones - Buggin Out and Radio Raheem - who trigger the events that cause the tragedy, they are not necessarily the ones who finish it. It is Mookie and Sal, in fact, who ultimately play the main part.

Do The Right Thing is not an easy watch; it's a mesmerizing, tense, difficult film that breaks many taboos and slaughters many holy cows. But in the end of it - hopefully - you'll be wiser than you were in the beginning, and that's what Lee have always tried to achieve in all his films. Watch it to get a real view on racism that doesn't duck the difficult issues and isn't afraid to tackle the real problem, and to see a master director at work. It's one of the best films of its time.",10.0,24 May 2005
Spike Lee's best work! A mind-blowing masterpiece of cinema! @,"""Do the Right Thing"" is a powerful, uplifting, visually stunning masterpiece. It's a movie that I can watch over and over again, and deservedly takes the Number 7 Spot of My Favorite Movies Of All Time. This was one of Spike's debut efforts, and until this day--the best one. Spike gives us an honest, unflinching look at the Bedford-Stuyvestant area of Brooklyn on the hottest day of the summer. He perfectly displays the racial tensions that go on between everybody from blacks to whites to Koreans. Yet he never gets preachy, which is one of the brilliant things about this movie. Some of Spike's best work is demonstrated in his shots of Radio Raheem, played excellently by Bill Nunn. RR doesn't say much, but he has this violent gaze which sums up his feelings without a word being said. Spike gives us some great angles of his face, demonstrating the pure rage brewing inside of him. He also has a great scene in which he sums up the meanings of love and hate, in Spike's trademark poetry-in-motion style. RR constantly carries around a boombox, playing the same song ""Fight the Power"" by Public Enemy. That song is one of the best musical themes in movie history, perfectly summing up racial tension among inner cities. This movie doesn't tell its audience that black people are better than others, nor does it say that Hispanics are, or whites, or Asians. It just gives us a raw look at what happens when we let racial quarrels get out of hand. We learn how sometimes it's appropriate to preach against racism, and sometimes we're just overreacting.

The cast is terrific, and they deliver memorable performances. I really wish Danny Aiello picked up the Oscar for his role as Sal, because that is definitely the pinnacle performance of his career and one of the best I've ever seen. Other noteworthy performances are by John Turturro, Ossie Davis and Giancarlo Esposito.

The film is put together with such fast-paced editing that it doesn't once get boring, doesn't have any low points. This is a gritty, memorable film that I wish can be considered more prominent in the eyes of the average moviegoer, because it really deserves great recognition for its unique, unforgettable style.

Spike definitely knows how to do the right thing.

My score: 10 (out of 10)",10.0,30 April 2001
An underappreciated masterpiece,"I find it a tremendous oversight that this film gets so little recognition. The American film institute couldn't find one place in one hundered American films for this cinematic masterpiece that pulls no punches . It got no academy award and most importantly I could not find one friend who had heard of it. I call this a tremendous oversight because the film is wonderful. I know that Spike Lee is a rather eccentric personality and is not well liked by everyone, but his films are brilliant and this is no exception.

For about the first two thirds of the movie the plot meanders around a section of New York City as the characters awaken and start their days. For this first two thirds we have a comedy that is funny because of the eccentric and wonderfully developed characters. The audience is pulled into the story by the rich dialogue and inventive cinematography. There is just some quality about this film that makes it seem so real. This all sets up for the imminent tragedy to be all the worse as a result of the connection the audience has with the movie.

Then the film explodes. Those who have seen it know what I mean and those who have not should see it. This last third of the film should not be explained, it must be experianced. In fact this whole film should be experianced. I can't say enough.",,20 April 2000
practically the definition of a must-see movie,"I have heard people describe Spike Lee as a second-rate filmmaker; all I have to say is that second-rate filmmakers do not make films like this. Do the Right Thing is a masterpiece in both style and substance, and Im hard pressed to think of a more powerful, earth-shattering film.

But first, let's talk about the style. The color palette of the movie is wonderful; while its mostly deep reds, they manage to bring home the feeling that the residents of Bed-Stuy must have been feeling on that day. The cinematography is excellent... it features a lot of weird viewpoints and angles, but they are used to great effect and manage to work within the style of the film. One thing that really managed to impress me about the film is the razor sharp dialogue... each character has their own style of talking, and it really works well. This is a masterfully written film.

Now the substance... this movie manages to spiral into a truly spectacular ending. Throughout, its easy to see the necessary elements building, and, when it happens, it hardly seems like a surprise, but that doesn't make it any less shattering. The way that each character acts defines this movie throughout, especially at the end! Spike Lee does a brilliant job here. The movie is interesting and well-made throughout; each of the characters are three-dimensional and feel like real human beings - their motivation is understood throughout.

Do the Right Thing is a brilliant movie that never lags and never lets up. It manages to be vastly entertaining and vastly powerful at the same time. It's truly an amazing achievement in film, and its a shame it was not recognized more for its obvious brilliance when it was released in 1989.",10.0,6 April 2001
"A Brilliant Film, Though Controversial",,7.0,11 August 2008
Cruel reality meets light-hearted comedy,"I went to see a free showing of this film the other night, in light of recent events. Where a younger version of myself would have maybe shrugged and thought 'Well, this is an extreme depiction of reality', I now realize that it is not.

Do the Right Thing is a beautiful mix of comedy, great narration (what movie introduces an entire block of characters and makes you care about each of them?), intense dialogue and a very dark, grueling reality we live in, today. Not just in the United States, but everywhere in the world.

Unfortunately it cannot be fully called a historical drama yet. But hopefully, some day in the future we can watch this, have a chuckle and weep tears of sadness for the past in which racism, prejudice, bigotry and police brutality was commonplace. Until then: let's spread this movie out like a virus. It's been 30 years with hardly any change, the previous generations haven't been able to eradicate the evil that is racism. Let's do our best to make a difference.",9.0,10 June 2020
Great film but the message is mixed,"As a non white or non black person my self I view this film from a different perspective as I can't relate to either community. I understand Lee's message and point in the film and even after 30 years after the release, it is more relevant than ever. But for the character of Sal, he is punished for standing his ground. Should he have racially abused black people based on their race, no. But should he have been given the blame for the death of a black man, no. If Raheem killed Sal, which is definitely what he was trying by strangling him, the black community in the film wouldn't have been guilty for his death and say he deserved it. All he did was brake his radio. Sal saying that he only puts Italian American people on his wall is completely justified as he comes from a Italian heritage. If a white man entered the restaurant of a black man and said put up pictures of white men that wouldn't be seen as right. And it applies for both races, just because he is a white man doesn't mean he should be punished. Mookie's decision to boycott the restaurant and allow for the rest to burn down Sal's restaurant has no justification. I didn't understand Lee's point, was he trying to make black people look worse of better? To me it only represented what Americans think of the black community.",7.0,2 April 2021
The Boiling Point,"A scorching summer day brings racial tensions to their boiling point in a Brooklyn neighborhood. Seen through many points of view Spike Lee paints a convincing and critical picture of tensions in the most diverse city in the USA.

The film's strength is its ability to ring true to many sets of ears and especially if you frequent or live in a big city. You always here of events - big and small - on the news and there is usually that element of ""racial tensions"" or ""possible racial motive."" In a city where over 200 different languages are spoken (which can give you an idea of how many distinguishable cultures there are) it is only a natural ingredient for friction between people. Whether you hate the other guy, or are just annoyed that you can't understand him nor he you, when all you want to do is buy some groceries. This film shows many situations of this type and how everyone is, in a sense, innocent and guilty at the same time. If a situation gets out of hand and you have people throwing slurs at each other there is that famous expression: ""he crossed the line."" Well even with critical hindsight, this ""line"" isn't always visible and when it is, it's faint.

Spike Lee manages to show that very well and with a lot of diverse characters, hence the film being able to ring true with an equally diverse audience.

The only problem is that in today's America the issue is more about class and not just race, though race and class are intertwined. ""Crash"" presented the issue of class and lifestyle a little bit more thoroughly, but in the end felt preachy and unrealistically sentimental. ""Do the Right Thing"" is much tighter and the film's climax and overall impact is more powerful. Also of the note is the terrific acting from the entire cast. --- 9/10

excellent drama with a message,"If I had to make a list of the top ten things that I find most boring, racism would be right at the summit along with economics and The Blair Witch Project. For that reason, I have avoided Do the Right Thing up until now for fear that it would be a lecture on racism...but actually, I don't know what I was afraid of, as this film is really good. Spike Lee's racial drama is actually more a film about the feebleness of racial divides and how violence only breeds violence, as opposed to a film ABOUT racism. In fact, the film can be best described as a cinematic materialisation of Martin Luther King's famous ""an eye for an eye leaves everybody blind"" speech.

For this movie, Spike Lee has put together a terrific cast, that includes many actors that have gone on to become big names in the movie industry, people such as Samuel L. Jackson, John Turturro and Martin Lawrence, not to mention smaller stars such as Ossie Davis. The cast comes together excellently and the neighbourhood that Spike Lee has created for this film feels very real, and through the multiple personalities that inhabit it, it manages to stay interesting and realistic throughout. The atmosphere of the neighbourhood is also of note, and you really do get the feeling that someone could say 'biatch' or 'dogg' at any time. Spike Lee delights in showing us many different people, and at different times - including their reactions to certain events and their interactions with each other, and it all helps to build up both their own characters and the neighbourhood that they live in. This proves to be invaluable to the film as it has no real plot and therefore relies on the characters and the neighbourhood that it has created to build itself, it's scenario and therefore it's message, up.

Do the Right Thing is a portrait of how multiple cultures live together in modern day America and it also succeeds in being a stark and potent portrayal of how violence never gets anyone anywhere. Spike Lee has shown his talents as an actor, director and a writer with this film, and even though majority opinion of him seems to be that he's a disagreeable old crone; at least he's one that has talent.",8.0,10 December 2004
A masterpiece full of sound and fury,,10.0,5 December 2001
A brave film you could never make today....,"""Do the Right Thing"" is a film about race and race relations that you simply wouldn't see made today in Hollywood. Why? Because the film is brutally honest about race...and would make the heads of many politically correct folks explode by the dialog! No, the film is not a sanitized view of race....the language is raw and vile...but also realistic. And, talking about race WITHOUT racial epithets and the ugliness of racism would have neutered this film....and I like how the film is in your face about the topic.

The story is set in an ethnic neighborhood where mostly Black and Hispanic folks live. There also are shop keepers who are Italian and Korean. And, in many ways this is typical of many inner city neighborhoods...and not just in New York. Everything occurs during very, very hot summer day....and the heat clearly put everyone on edge. Add to that a lot of hatred, a lot of folks talking AT each other and not TO each other....and you have a recipe for a horrible tragedy. But it's best you just see it all for yourself.

I appreciate the story not only because it does not sanitize racism but because it provides a lot to think about but doesn't spoon feed you answers....other than folks just need to listen to each other more than we often do. Many incidents are up to the interpretation of the viewers and the story, though horribly sad, seems very relevant today...not just 1989.

By the way, if you are worried that the film might be some sort of attack on any ethnic group, I don't think it was the film's intention at all. See it and see for yourself.

Also by the way, I am surprised the film wasn't nominated for Best Picture. I am not necessarily saying it was the best film of the year, but clearly it was better than several of the actual nominees.",10.0,26 September 2021
American cinema vérité,"It's a hot day in Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn and it's getting on everybody's nerves. Mister Señor Love Daddy (Samuel L. Jackson) is the radio DJ. Sal Fragione (Danny Aiello) owns the local Italian pizzeria where his sons Vito (Richard Edson) and Pino (John Turturro) work. Mookie (Spike Lee) is Sal's delivery boy and finds himself in the center of the boiling racial tension. Tina (Rosie Perez) is his girlfriend. Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) is Mookie's friend who is railing against everything. Mother Sister (Ruby Dee) watches over the neighborhood. Drunk Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) sweeps the sidewalk for a dollar everyday and tells Mookie ""To always do the Right Thing."" Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) carries around his loud boom box.

This movie is most notable for bringing everyday race relations to the screen. Buggin' Out demanding to have black pictures in the pizzeria is one of those great scenes in American cinema. The biggest complaint is the lack of drugs. In the end, this is not suppose to be a hard gritty realistic portrait. It's a racial struggle where the characters are everyday people. There are no easy villains. Spike Lee taps into something more powerful than just a bunch of stereotypes. It's the Korean grocery story, the yuppie moving in, the old black resentments, the Italian holdouts, the Puerto Ricans, the young punks, the police, and the heat.",9.0,27 September 2014
When someone does the wrong thing and others react the wrong way,"On a hot summer day in a predominantly black neighborhood in Brooklyn, one person makes the wrong decision and sets off a chain of events that results in havoc. Rosie Perez is a highlight on the feminine front.

""Do the Right Thing"" was Spike Lee's breakthrough film that he made when he was 31. It's a stylish and spirited account of a mostly black community in New York City that's well-rounded with drama, humor, entertainment, honesty and tragedy.

On the one hand, this neighborhood seems like a pleasant enough place to live, if you don't mind the big city. The characters are not painted as one-dimensional, generally speaking; they have both attributes and faults. Yet it's a relatively peaceable environment with the various races/ethnicities getting along just fine with only minor (and amusing) altercations. Nevertheless, it's a tinderbox that doesn't take much to set aflame.

The last act leaves a bad taste. I can't believe Lee had the gonads to be this honest, but he shows why most people don't want to live or do business in black neighborhoods, including many blacks.

While people debate who's right and who's wrong, it's simple to figure out: Buggin Out taking offense about something immaterial at Sal's pizzeria is unjustified. If he thinks it's that big of a deal he doesn't have to dine there, plus he can start his own restaurant and decorate it however he wishes. At the same time, it could be argued that Sal should've reacted in a wiser way that turned away Buggin Out's curious anger, rather than augment it. Meanwhile Radio Raheem makes a foolish decision by allowing Buggin Out to negatively influence him. Why can't they just do the right thing? It's frustrating.

This is a well-made classic and worthy of its iconic status, it's just not exactly my cup of tea due to the exasperating last act that's too brutally honest. How about doing the right thing by making art that inspires hope, unity and healing for inner city communities? This piece points to the problem, inspires questions & debates, but offers no solutions except... move away from black neighborhoods.

The film runs 2 hours and was shot in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.

"Spike Lee's explosive, brilliant cinematic masterpiece","I felt that Do the Right Thing should have been included in the AFI's Top 100. It has remained a powerful and moving film that I cannot stop thinking about years after its release. All of the elements so beautifully coalesce: the acting (from Turturro to Davis to Harris to Esposito; its all superb), the cinematography (Dickerson's extreme angles and vivid color scheme perfectly contribute to the feeling of heat), the screenplay (funny and light catapults to poignant and fierce in the blink of an eye), and the direction (Lee is never afraid to take huge risks in his technique). Everything pays off double. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.",,8 January 1999
Did anyone in this movie do the right thing?,"It doesn't look like any of the characters did the ""right thing.""

Mookie and Sal were mostly on the right track until the last ten minutes.

For that matter, it's hard to see how anyone could've done the right thing, given the desperate straits they were all in.

I guess that's the point.

But still, it was frustrating to watch Mookie and Sal, the two most reasonable people in the movie, because they were so unbearably stubborn, Sal in his self-righteousness and Mookie in his laziness.

What no character did well was to step back and really try to take a look at the big picture.

do this...,"When I first saw this movie in the early 90's it really didn't interest me, but I thought it was OK. After watching it again last night I realize it was still just OK, even though everybody else in the world thinks it is some kind of super movie here to bring the struggles and views of the poor black into the homes of the average American. But after some offhanded remarks and resultant discussion with the(Japanese) wife I realized that Mr. Lee may still be the giant egotist we all know and love but I don't believe this was directed so much towards the mainstream, as it was towards the poor black youth who blames all his troubles on everybody else and consequently acts with questionable wisdom. (not unlike the racial reversal Travolta film 'White Mans Burden')

Of course you can go on forever talking about how racism is bad, and stereotype this and negativity that, but as Mookie shows us what he doesn't learn, it all comes down to (money?) doing the right thing. This chronically late worker, not in school, absent father gets mad at the perceived wrong committed by his employer and incites a riot. While certainly being an easy thing to do, I can find no circumstance within the movie that justifies this as being the right thing to do. For the black youth looking for the right thing to do, the messages are pretty clear:

1. Get a job

2. Dont beat up the dorky white guy for accidently scuffing your devastatingly important Nikes

3. Be a little considerate and turn down the radio.

4. Sal and Co. aren't out to get you, and if you dont like em,

5. Save your money, open your own pizza shop, put whoever you want on the wall.

Lee expands on this further with 'Clockers', where the kid escapes from his block at the end. But for the majority of contemporary viewers I feel this movie just follows standard Hollywood formulas of: excessive foul language, (thankfully few) immature sexual references , and constant and unabated conflict that leaves you quite tired by the end of the film.

While this movie rates as only OK with me I gave it a '7' for the excellent acting and honest representation of peoples feelings towards situations that exists in Brooklyn today. I mean seriously, you can go to the Fulton Street Mall and watch a live reenactment of this movie everyday. Arab, Hispanic, and Italian shop owners dealing with the young black still acting up on the block.

After watching it I have to admit those people were right. The movie showed a Brooklyn street during a heat wave in the summer. This block was mostly African Americans however there was a pizzeria owned by Italians as well as a grocery store owned by Koreans. The movie showed how different minority groups view each other. I found it extremely interesting during the montage of racial slurs to see that even groups who are harassed because of their ethnicity still do it to other groups. The end of the movie really surprised me. I figured there would be some sort of clash of the groups however I didn't think that it would explode the way it did. Another part of the movie which really surprised me was how the police were portrayed, as murderers and bigots. One scene in the movie which really stuck with me was when the fire fighters were trying to put out the fire and they used the hose on the African American rioters. This scene to me really showed how not much has changed in some sense since the 1960s. Overall I found this movie to be extremely well done and very powerful and definitely one of Spike Lee's best movies.",9.0,30 March 2005
Classic Spike Lee,"I saw this film, and have since purchased it and seen it several more times, and I have come to the consensus that this is the greatest Spike Lee movie ever made and one of the greatest films ever made . . . ever. The story revolves around racial tension which has existed forever, but more specifically tension which has risen to new heights on one of the hottest day of the year in Brooklyn. This movie, rather this masterpiece is an extraordinary and brilliant depiction of racism, the aspects of racism, the characters involved in that racism, and the profound and fateful impact it has on life. The acting is believable, as are the characters, and Spike Lee's vision behind the camera is once again reaffirmed as genius. And all though this film may cause some viewers to cringe and disbelieve at the actions and reactions of the characters and the story, I did not. I thank Mr. Lee for not sugarcoating and censoring this explosive and all-too-real tale. If you get a chance to see this film, Do the Right Thing and see it.",10.0,22 July 2000
Great for illustrating race and racism,I watched this movie in my cultural geography class. We were discussing the concept of Race and how it has been conceived as a biological description for such a long time. In reality it is a cultural discourse that has been molded through history. The film really helped illustrate Race and Racism. Spike Lee's use of unstated stereotypes constructs particular kinds of racial landscape which in turn inform the kinds of interactions different characters have throughout the movie. Excellent film. I recommend this film to anyone interested in how race and racism works in the world. It brings an uneasy humor which allows a diverse group of people (such as my class) to laugh together but at the same time share and contrast physical emotions.,10.0,1 November 2005

Controversy Needed,"Do the Right Thing (1989)

**** (out of 4)

I'll give my opinions on the controversy and some of George's statements in a bit. As for the film, I personally thought it was brilliantly made. Everything from the dialogue to the direction to the acting is all top-notch. The screenplay just comes off so natural that while you're watching the film you actually think all of the stuff was just coming from the actors on the spot and to me that's the sign of a great screenplay. Even the cinematography was top-notch to the point where you could feel that hot summer day burning you.

Now for the controversy. I certainly understand why George and various others called the film's racist but IN THE FILM, the characters are racist but I don't think THE FILM was trying to say that everyone in the world is racist. I think the racism is these characters are not really the people watching the film. It's rather strange because all the racism really took off during the riot scene and some of this might have been done for a message but I think it also took away from some of the characters. The final act of the film really turned into a remake of The Birth of a Nation. In TBOAN, blacks attack whites and the Klan shows up to save the day. In this film, blacks attack whites and the ""Klan"", ala cops and firemen, show up to save the day. People say Griffith showed blacks as animals but what shocked me here is that Spike Lee did the exact same thing here. Throughout the film we see blacks who are either drunks, jobless or racists not doing a thing and then in the end they start a riot. The white characters are all ""workers"" who ""put up"" with blacks but deep down they feel that blacks aren't nothing but the ""N"" word. WTF??? This ending, I feel really took away from the Danny Aiello character. The only white person in a black neighborhood stays in business and is well liked for 25 years yet his racist nature only comes out on this day? Wouldn't they have known this guy was a racist from the start? Then there's the Spike Lee character who works for this white people and tries to ""do the right thing"" by working yet he turns into one of the ""animals"" at the drop of a hat? The only non-racist person in the film just happens to be a drunk so is there some sort of message here? For the sake of an argument I'll say that all the non-racists were at work and Lee just didn't want to show them in the movie. If everyone shown in this film were as racist as we see in the last part then I think that pizza store would have been burned down years earlier. I personally don't feel this neighborhood was nothing but racists but Lee certainly wants us to think that. I think the racist angle was just used at the end to get soem sort of message across, which we get to read in the end with the quotes from King and Malcolm X. These two quotes go against one another so perhaps Lee didn't know what he was trying to get across.

In the commentary Lee does bring up some of the controversy and adds some rather interesting comments to the film. He asked why white America was so upset with the pizza joint burning down yet didn't feel anything for the black guy that the cops killed. I would answer Spike that the viewer doesn't need to connect with the person being killed. Do we tell Arnold, Willis or Gibson to just arrest someone and not kill them? If they do kill the bad guys do we question why they did it instead of taking a lesser act? I think the reason people overlooked the killing was because the guy killed was a stereotype bad guy. Lee never took the time to show this guy doing anything except harrassing people so why should we feel anything at the end? On the other side of things, it's rather hard to support the pizza store owner because he just HAD to throw out a racist slur after 25 years. Wouldn't it seem more natural for his older son to shout out this slur since we already knew he was a racist? In the commentary Lee said that Aiello didn't want his character to be racist but Lee forced him to do so. If that one word wasn't said then the white characters couldn't have been racist and there wouldn't have been any question regarding the pizza store vs. the black guy. Throughout the film Lee introduces ""bad characters"" and then, in the end, turns the good characters into bad characters so how are we suppose to feel? As with Crash, I think this type of racism only lives in the screenwriters head. I personally don't see how anyone can look at either of these films (or the Griffith movie) and see any sort of truth. All three films contain stereotypes that lead to controversy but I think the jokes on the viewer because there really shouldn't be any sort of controversy. These films have characters acting racist for entertainment only. I don't see any message in any film and if there are suppose to be messages, then I think only the screenwriter would get them. I understand the word racist being thrown at this film but I think by doing so we're giving Lee too much credit. I'm going to look at these racist characters and events as a form of entertainment. I personally don't live in the world these guys put up on screen so a message isn't going to do me any good.",,26 February 2008
Summer in the city,"""Do The Right Thing"" is an early Spike Lee opera which takes place during one hot summer day in a Brooklyn neighborhood where the weather brings the people out into the streets and in contact with each other. On the up side, the film has an excellent cast and is colorful, busy, and well crafted. On the downside, there's not much of a story in this tableau which makes trite statements about racism in America while obvious histrionics and staginess undermine the film's credibility and meager entertainment value. A lukewarm watch at best. (B-)",6.0,11 May 2003
The Melting Pot Becomes A Scorcher!!,"The bottom line on afflictions and agitated dirges of emphatic disagreement are all due to one culprit... Everybody's life is total abject misery!! The array of cultural stereotypes in this movie did anything but galvanize, they became down and outright isolated!! Fruition with accomplishments manifested itself in a very dismal way in this film, and the perpetual imagery of oppressive heat in this outdated New York City neighborhood was dreadfully ubiquitous!! Beligerance with the African American culture was irksome to the old Italian culture because it was very non-comprehensible!! The lives of all of these sub middle class New Yorkers was one where their careless actions manifested their acts of precarious amelioration!! Every dilemma was attributed to money, or more significantly, everybody's lack of it!! New York City has always garnered a featherbed of assimilation into it's cosmopolitan dynamic. The movie ""Do the Right Thing"" depicts the ramifications of such a fate!! This film has tremendous acting performances by a number of actors and actresses, and Spike Lee's involvement in this movie is sensational!! This website has ranked this film one of the top 250 best film ever in the history of American movie making... This is totally understandable, as I have rarely seen a movie which intensifies it's emotions so graphically that you have a thorough conception of what each and everyone of the main characters in this film is going through!!

"On the hottest day of this summer, unless you have a pool, STAY INSIDE and WATCH this movie!","I love this movie. It is obvious that this movie would have been one of racial conflicts, but conflict is what makes a movie so good. One thing although I don't understand is, why is it a pizzeria? Like it is a good idea, since Italians own and run it, but its the hottest day of the summer, people want ice cream, i think that would have been the more logical choice concerning the circumstances, but still overall amazing. Also, the different characters in the movie are good. They all have different personalities, that tie together and have a great effect. Spike Lee usually writes good dramatic movies with some comedy here and there, so kudos to him.

Spike Lee's best film.,"Here is a film, Spike Lee's best, that takes on a controversial subject such as racism, and doesn't indulge in emotional manipulation, prejudiced intolerance, or exaggerated endeavors. The film centers around a neighborhood of different races and colors that long for demographic equality, but must unfortunately tolerate one another and withhold their true bigot nature to avoid violent opposition.

However, through an absolutely plausible stream of events, an intense onslaught occurs, all the tension between the Hispanics, Blacks, Whites, and Asians explodes, just as they all envisioned it would. We watch with dread as all the setup finally unfolds, without restraint, with tragic aftermath.

The main characters and the dialogue shared between them rings true, almost relateable in the sense that we share the same weaknesses, and we all have our lot of negative criticism to our surroundings. Spike Lee understands his characters, and creates three-dimensional personalities through his obvious experience with racial intolerance.

Lee's perfect structure and visual enticement is one trademark he uncannily includes in all of his films. His structure never descends into an episodic, forced stream of events, he never adds random, implausible plot elements to boost interest. His films usually hold a wide range of ideas and satirical merit, but with restrained, authentic execution. Only during his climaxes does he take his films to another dimension of realism, but even those usually hold sardonic entity.

Overall, Do The Right Thing is a visceral, unique experience, one that doesn't preach that racism is bad, but shows you how cultural and ethical differences can tear apart an entire community.",10.0,29 June 2008
Do The Right Thing,"Do The Right Thing is a powerful movie full of the everyday struggles facing the minorities of this world. this movie plunges you into the intercity life and shows you things you may have never seen.

This movie is powerful and sends out a strong message, with no resolve by the end, this movie really does leave you wondering ""what is the right thing?""",8.0,10 May 2011
No Humanity in any Characters,"I was incredibly disappointed by this movie. The only character that seemed to be anything other than a crude cartoon was the Mayor. Seriously, I know that riots have been started over tragically trivial things in real life, but a radio? I'm sure any store owner, whether black or not, would have objected to Radio Raheem's obnoxious boom box. And once the cops showed up and there was a real reason for outrage, the community continued to lash out at Sal's shop, ignoring that Raheem would quite likely have murdered him in the street had the cops not arrived. And, no, that in no way justifies the actions of the office who killed Raheem. And how dare Mookie ask Sal for his salary?",,8 August 2009
Do the Right Thing,,6.0,11 May 2011
"Results vary on the viewer, but it's still mostly mind-blowing","One of Spike Lee's best (and most discusses) films- Do the Right Thing, tells the story of the community in the small yet important Bedford-Stuyvesant and the different characters and situations that come together in some way or another on the hottest day of the summer. There is Mookie, played by Lee himself, as a realistic pizza boy, Danny Aiello as the tough but fair pizza store owner, Ossie Davis as the block's drunkard and a lot of other interesting characters. This all leads up to a volcanic and (dare I say) appropriate climax. Written, directed, acted and photographed with pizazz and with a superb quality about it, Do the Right Thing shouldn't be ignored, and should be watched if only to get a better understanding of what Spike Lee did for a breakthrough. Also one of the best films of 1989. A+",10.0,19 November 2001
"Spike Lee's thought-provoking ""Do the Right Thing""","Film-making is a tough & competitive business with directors following Hollywood movie-making protocols in order to stay busy. One director/writer dares to defy Hollywood standards of film-making like none other, and that man is Spike Lee. Lee's prior films such as ""Mo' Better Blues"" & ""School Daze"" have transcended the usual methods of movie-making by using unorthodox camera angles, derogatory racial slang, & elusive story lines/topics/messages as well as race relations in America. No other director has tackled the issue of race relations in America & the Black consciousness better, more accurate, or with more conviction than Lee. ""Do the Right Thing"" challenges the notion that no matter where you live or who you are, we all have preconceived notions about each other in terms of race & ethnicity. And at any given moment under certain circumstances, racial tension can erupt with only dire consequences to follow.

The film centers around the Bedford-Styvesant section of Brooklyn on the hottest day of the summer. On a corner in the middle of the neighborhood stands Sal's Famous pizzeria, owned & operated by Italian-American Sal(Danny Aiello) & sons Pito(john Turturro) & Vito(Richard Edson). For more than 20 years, Sal has made his delicious Italian-American food for many of the neighborhood's residents to his satisfaction. Sal is content with where he does business & wants no troubles. Unlike his father, Pino hates the pizzeria & is prejudiced towards Blacks & Hispanics. Pino's ire is further bolstered because of pizzeria deliveryman & deadbeat father Mookie(Lee). Mookie, well known in the 'hood, goes about his day always looking to ""get paid"". Mookie isn't so popular with girlfriend Tina(Rosie Perez) who cares for their young son Hector, who Mookie rarely sees or supplies support to. On top of that, Mookie lives with responsible & socially conscience younger sister Jade(Joie Lee) who constantly reminds Mookie to ""take care of his responsibilities"" & be a man.

As the film marches on & the mercury rises to very uncomfortable levels, racial tensions begin to bubble. Incidents upon incidents begin to occur. In the midst of the burgeoning tensions, a lonely & drunken old man called Da' Mayor(the late Ozzie Davis) tries to win over stern & cynical matriarch Mother Sista(real life spouse Ruby Dee) in a quirky kind of love between the two. Neighborhood lackeys ML(Paul Benjamin), Coconut Sid(Frankie Faison), & ""Sweet Dick"" Willie(the late comic Robin Harris) complain about new immigrants to the area have better opportunities to succeed while Blacks like themselves continue to struggle to make ends meet. Local youth cause mischief, city police make reluctant rounds, & Sal endures run-ins with neighborhood tough ""Radio"" Raheem(Bill Nunn) & loud mouth Buggin Out(Giancarlo Esposito). Enraged by the failure of Sal to put Blacks as well as Italian-Americans on his pizzeria's ""Wall of Fame"", Buggin' Out calls for a boycott of Sal's Famous. With ""Radio Raheem at his side, Buggin' Out storms into Sal's Famous. When Sal destroys ""Radio"" Raheem's boom box, a major fistfight ensues & starts an all out riot that spills into the streets. City police & fire arrive on the scene to quell the madness. In the process of apprehending ""Radio"" Raheem, police apply a choke hold too tight & strangle the neighborhood tough. Realizing ""Radio"" Raheem has been murdered, the resident youth converge on Sal's Famous to loot, destroy, & set it ablaze. The carnage affects everyone present, especially Mookie. The following day Mookie returns to Sal's Famous to collect his final pay. Angrily, Sal pays Mookie & inquires what his former employee plans to do. Mookie states that he is on his way to visit with his son & find a new way to ""get paid"".

Check out a young Martin Lawrence who plays a minor role along with a supporting cast of relatively unknowns. Call this film what you will. Judge it on it's merits or lack thereof. One thing cannot be denied; this movie makes you take a long, hard look at race relations in America & its ever presence in our society, no matter how shallow or how deep you believe racial prejudice to exist in our everyday lives. Lee's methods are ""in your face"" & controversial to say the least but nonetheless effective, if you take the time to pay attention. Check it out, even if just to satisfy your curiosity.

Powerful work of art,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. It was a really powerful movie that involved an issue that has been going on forever. And Spike Lee did a good job of capturing what its like to be a black man, especially living in the streets of NYC. I thought it was a powerful message to have at the very beginning of the movie the video of Rodney King being beaten by cops, which cop brutality is an issue we are still dealing with. I noticed that the colors of the film were mostly yellow and red, maybe as a symbol of the power that the white man has. In the movie the cops kill Mookie's friend in the middle of a brawl, and as the one cop is restraining Mookies friend, he is choking him to death with his club. The other cop even kept yelling at the cop to stop because he could see the kid was about to die, but the cop didn't care and continued. So they just throw him the back of the car.

This of course made Mookie and the rest of the crowd very angry at the police Mookie decided to pick up a trash can and throw it threw Sal's window which caused the rest of the crowd to start breaking everything and set the place on fire. I don't think Mookie should have done this because violence just creates more violence and nothing gets solved but things get damaged and people get hurt. I don't think the two boys in the film should have gone up to Sal in the first place, they have no right to demand anything when it is his store. They knew they were trying to start something and did.

Watching this movie and watching movies like this, the only reaction I seem to get is anger. Which is what I think Spike Lee wanted us all to feel watching this movie. This was an excellent Spike Lee and I highly recommend it.",10.0,6 May 2016
Important movie from spike,"A hot day causes tensions in a neighborhood that leads to a riot, a death, and more violence.

Overall this isa movie with a strong message and lots of style. It meanders in parts and is so hyper focused to a particular way of life in a particular place that it might seem almost alien to outsiders. But the myriad of characters and small interactions do add up to something in the end and makes this a strong movie with something to say.

I would say the only problem is Spike Lee's acting. He's just not good. Sorry to say, but he brings down every scene as if he's just waiting for his turn to talk rather than actually begin the character. Anyone else would have been better, but it was his movie, so there you go. He doesn't ruin the whole thing, but he is distracting as heck.",7.0,9 October 2022

Masterpiece; No.,,8.0,5 January 2009
and make no mistake my friends.,"The movie that put Spike Lee on the map in 1989 and the one that established his brave and bold style. This feature can be checked with his lively directing. But Spike Lee is also talented as an actor. His character, ""Mookie"" increases liking. The same remark could be said for the whole cast. Lee describes his characters with either an ounce of irony, either an ounce of tenderness.

What makes the main strength of the movie is that the director goes with ease from comedy to drama. Indeed, the beginning of the film leads to expect a normal and trite day. But, gradually, tensions between communities rise and an incident is sufficient to spark off a riot. From this moment, this is a realistic and down-to-earth vision that Spike Lee suggests us and wants to underline the fact that racism, nowadays, ranks among the major problems in the USA and this problem is far from being solved. In this way, you can consider the characters of ""Smiley"" and """"Radio Raheem"" as a clumsy attempt to demand more rights and tolerance towards black people.

""Do the right thing"" is probably Spike Lee's most accomplished movie and one of the finest movies devoted to racism.",8.0,16 February 2004
"Spike Lee's Do the Right was quite an upsetting, but still thoughtful, piece of work to me",,8.0,19 February 2012
Perhaps the dumbest & most overrated film ever made,"Spike Lee's `Do the Right Thing' is a vastly overrated film and a deeply unfortunate exercise of self-denial and a promotion of violence without reason.

Consider this: This film supposedly is about how a black community in Brooklyn is being oppressed by the `power'. And their `oppression' is made unbearable by a summer heat wave. Spike Lee totally ignores the fact that these characters can simply move somewhere else or heaven-forbid, actually work and do something meaningful with their lives.

Mookie as played by Spike Lee is ingrate and a poor excuse for a father. His girlfriend is a foul-mouth character played by Rosie Perez. As this charming couple uses one curse word after another in the presence of their child you really have to wonder why we should even begin to care about them. These characters are without any class or sense of responsibility.

The death of Radio Raheem (who spends his days walking around listening to his boombox and nothing else) sparks a riot against the only people (besides the Korean grocers) who actually work and provide a service to the community. And on top of that, Raheem only dies because he resists arrest by the police officers trying to stop a riot. This is no hero worth weeping over.

And what sparks this riot? Sal the Pizzeria owner (Danny Aiello) who runs and owns his own business has the audacity as a free citizen in a free country to display photos of his personal heroes who happened fellow Italian-Americans. Late one night as he is closing up shop, he nicely lets in some customers (when he has every right not to) to serve them pizza. With gratitude, these customers start verbally and physically attacking Sal. Mookie (whose only source is income is Sal) throws a garbage can through Sal's window.

Perhaps it's proper since this film is complete garbage.",,8 November 2002
Spike Lee made the right movie.,,7.0,9 December 2010
Black & White,"Let's take a little time on director's ambitions. Not all, but some of the most important directors in the business, are ambitious. They are always seeking beyond the images of their films, with a personal message the viewer don't always gets to appreciate. It happens more with writer/directors. Paul Thomas Anderson has been pursuing, I believe, the sadness of human reality, in all its aspects. In other cases, with directors but not writers, like Martin Scorsese; who puts something about his own life in each piece he directs. Writer/director Spike Lee generated the controversy that he would generate periodically years later when he released ""Do the right thing"". What does Spike Lee pursues? The fairness for his people: African-American, black people. As in many other movies, he proved that right with ""Do the right thing"".

Lee invites the audience to a typical day in Brooklyn. Right there, we listen to rap music, saying ""fight the power""; and when we see Spike Lee in his character Mookie, we know there's something about Lee's life. And we realize the film is his when we meet his realism, his characters and his (I wanted to arrive here) ambitions. We listen to Mister Senor Love Daddy (an over top, outrageously funny Sam Jackson) saying good morning from his radio station: ""And that's the truth, Ruth"". It's a sunny day; Mookie goes to work and bumps into a lot of people: Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito) and his friends Cee (Martin Lawrence), Punchy (Leonard Thomas) and other girls, the retarded Smiley (Roger Smith) Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) attempting to conquest Mother Sister's (Ruby Dee) heart, Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) spreading style all over, Tina (Rosie Perez) waiting for his man, three old men sitting in the street talking about lifeThis is black territory all the way through.

But there's also ""Sal's (Danny Aiello) Famous Pizza"", hated by his son Pino (John Turturro), who works there with his other brother Vito (Richard Edson), but loved by the entire neighborhood. The place has been there for over twenty years and the pizza is good; Mookie works there. But are these people black? Oh no, they're white Italians, with pictures of their white heroes in the walls of their place. So, when it seems like a common day, Spike Lee gets quietly to his objections. With his script, in which every character gets a chance to shine, he develops little things that you will find interesting and revealing. Buggin Out, the movie's craziest character, is the guy with the racist problems. This is not a movie where black hate white and vice versa. I mean, it's not like they love each other, but there's respect. The thing is that the characters are so marked by racism that they dislike the situation of being in the same environment the people of other color are. ""I detest this place"", says Pino.

Buggin Out has a problem with a white guy, when his new shoes are stepped by the guy. Buggin gets angry and asks what he's doing on ""his"" neighborhood, on ""his"" block on ""his"" side of the street. ""I own this place"", the guy answers. Then Buggin says: ""Why do you wanna live in a black neighborhood?"", Buggin asks angrily, referring to Brooklyn. ""I was born in Brooklyn"", the guy concludes. Buggin and his friends start shouting, and they can't understand that the guy was born there, because they are used to be among blacks and not among whites; but that's not hate. Anyway, that's the same Buggin that tells Mookie: ""Stay black""; because Mookie works with white people. A white man passes by with his old car, when Cee and company are playing with water. ""Don't throw water into my car"", he says. They do it, and laugh hard. The cops are also white, but they can't do anything to Cee and his friends, they were having fun and there's respect.

All of this characters are controlled by Lee, you can tell; even when he's also acting on screen. There's no doubt he knows that world more than anyone and how he wants to present it is very important. Like in ""25th Hour"", he moves his camera all around with his personal style, and puts his characters talking facing the camera directly. They start to say things, about other people and about themselves sometimes. In ""25th Hour"", the speakers where, black, white, Chinese, Korean, Latin AmericanAnything you could imagine, because it was a whole city. Before, in ""Do the right thing"", it was just a block, and the speakers where the people that lived there. It's amazing how Lee does it; the words he write and the characters stop talking but you know they have much more to say they could go on. You know Spike Lee has so much to say.

Going back to the story; Lee puts some clues to the incredibly unexpected conclusion. When Da Mayor tells Mookie: ""Always, always do the right thing"", and Buggin tells Sal that he is planning to boycott his placeYou feel something; like the way I felt as I watched ""It's the rage"". Something like a downfallA collapse. This is a very good movie, and I wasn't trying to interpret its conclusion, because I know how important a director's ambition is. So, when the screen goes black, and you read the words said by those black legends, you can only guess that everyone was just trying to do the right thing.",8.0,4 June 2005
One hot summer day in New York........,"A very distinctive and for it's time revolutionary film. The film opens on a scorching hot day deep in a poor block of new York with predominantly black residents. This isn't a crime infested gritty drug filled environment though, characters are mostly just getting by and living their own lives on their own terms. Under the surface though grievances are eating away at characters. There's a sense of futility to a lot of the characters lives which you get by the end. They are trapped to repeat the same things day in day out. The film has a very strong colour palette with lots of reds, blues and whites and yellows. The style is also very distinctive, with fast cuts, quick editing, characters talking directly to the camera, it's like a music video. It's not just the clothes but even the buildings which embody these colours. All the characters in this film have their problems, nobody is really satisfied with their lives. The film features various characters, some young, some older, mostly men, 3 Italian American men, two sons and their dad, there's hardly any women at all. The acting is great, the performances feel very natural, the dialogue is messy, crude but feels real and unscripted the interesting camera angles, movements, and directions and the way it almost breaks the 4th wall at various points is pretty unique and memorable. We also are given 3 guys who sit back and just take things in, giving a commentary, a radio dj, again who seems to be following the story and commenting on it somehow. It's a film with attitude, slang, fast talking characters and lots of hip-hop music used in the soundtrack. The film also has two cops in it who we meet again at the end. The film has no real main character we follow, it's more like a day in the life of this little block and all the problems these people have. It's all pretty hilarious until last 10 minutes when it turns super serious. There's one character, a sort of wise fool, who tries to act as a peacemaker and advises characters to do the right thing. Most of the action is centred around an Italian Pizzeria. Like many great films events take place over just 24 hours.",7.0,23 December 2023

I Can't Believe It Took Me 20 Years,"It took me 20 years to see this film, and I don't know why. I have always liked Spike Lee, and I teach film. Logic would suggest that I should have seen this by now. Now that I have seen it, the movie has been haunting me.

I think there is a huge misunderstanding about the film. Many assume this is pro-Black politics/world view; however, the movie seems to be squarely against Black ideology. This is a much more complex film than the silly movie Crash, and people should look at what this movie is actually showing. It does not clearly indict any ideology, and there is a strong question mark at the end.

First, many of the Black characters are silly and misguided. Sure, the ""son"" of the Italian restaurant owner is racist, but the father and other son clearly appreciate being a part of the community. In fact, prior to the riot, the owner is very pleased with his situation. The riot starters have a ridiculous request--to put Black pictures up in an Italian restaurant. It is clear that we are supposed to think they are not serious, and they do not really understand Black history. Even the older Black residents see them as silly.

The riot actually destroys one of the few places in the neighborhood that is welcoming. It creates distance. We do not fully understand why Spike Lee's character throws the trash can because he is even seen as a son. He seems to ""bite the hand that feeds him."" Nothing is resolved by the misdirected anger other than someone is dead. There is a picture placed on the wall, but the place is dead by that point. The fact that violence happens over a picture on a wall shows how superficial some race politics tend to be.

I know many think that Spike Lee is a ""race"" baiter--that he supports Black politics, but even Malcolm X tends to suggest that extreme Black politics can be misdirected. I suppose people can see what they want to see in the film, but the movie is much more complex than simple Black/White issues. This is a film that raises more questions than solves problems.",10.0,6 August 2009
A strong examination of incitement and radicalization,,,4 April 2017
31 years late watching this...AMAZING!,"Realizing I had never seen any of Spike Lee's movies, we put this on last night and were mesmerized. I had no idea. This is a masterpiece of a movie on so many levels and viewpoints that it was kind of overwhelming. Incredible actors and acting, cinematography, directing, editing, sound...it haunted my dreams last night, and continues to haunt me today. By ""haunt"", let me be clear that I mean the lingering presence of a life experience that was so rich and complex that your overwhelmed subconscious mind continues to process it long after the experience, seeking deeper comprehension, meaning, and answers. Not only was watching this film such an experience, but it was a technical masterpiece as well.

In the interest of no-spoilers, I will try to summarize what I think is important to say with care. Having read a bunch of online reactions of others to the movie already, I must say that like any good work of art, what you see in this film is what you want to see, biased by your preconceptions and life experiences. That is, in my opinion, the genius of this film. My ongoing subconscious yearnings for a bottom line, a moral lesson or meaning from this film, are doomed to end up unsatisfied in the end, because I don't think it exists. I don't think Spike Lee actually has an angle, a bias, or a lesson, other than ""do the right thing"", a simple reflection of the reality that consequences derive only from choices made, and that in choice alone lies morality, truth, and the power to affect a future outcome. Every individual choice--good or evil--writes the story of the future.

In this film, Spike Lee creates a vibrantly colored cinematic tapestry of life in a single 24 hour period on a single street. Within this tapestry he weaves a set of interlocking worlds containing stories of many detailed characters, each with their own backgrounds and troubles, each with their own hopes and aspirations, and each with their own struggles to survive in this microcosm that is their view of the world. Yet, these worlds all coexist on the same street, and as they overlap and collide there is both harmony and friction, there must be give and take.

Many say this film is about racism, but that is a colossal oversimplification. It's about human beings, who can be classified through genetics or culture in a multitude of ways: ethnicity and race, gender, parent or child, husband or wife, rich and poor, store owner and customer, spoken language, musical taste, mental health, disabilities, vices, or authority and power. In this movie, on a single day in a single place, we see through the lens of Spike Lee every single one of these facets of humanity play out in a struggle between harmony and conflict--between love and hate.

As my brain continues to struggle to find a clear punchline, a clear meaning, even a clear sense of what was right and what was wrong in this vivid story, I can only come to one conclusion: Spike Lee doesn't have a punchline, he only paints a picture to illustrate the human problem. In this picture lies the problem posed by the human condition, that we must always live amongst each other amid differences and conflicts and competition, and that even when we think we are doing a great job at this 99.9% of the time, life eventually presents us with a moment of split decision where our choices can have enormous consequences. Good versus Evil. The choice will never look as clear as those words imply, all we can attempt is to do the right thing.

Thank you Spike Lee, this film should have won multiple Oscars, and I can't wait to catch up on all your work which I embarrassingly have missed until now.",8.0,13 December 2020
Do The Right Thing (1989),,7.0,11 May 2011
Relevant to this day!,"I've seen a couple of Spike Lee 'joints'. I liked BlacKkKlansman but I wasn't a big of Da 5 Bloods. So far, Do the Right Thing is his best film.

Do the Right Thing takes place on the hottest day of the year in a Brooklyn neighbourhood and shows its residents as tensions being to mount when the day goes on.

I've seen this film a few times and it still has the same effect on me. Being his second feature film, Lee accomplishes so much with film in terms of its themes, characters and style. Working with cinematographer Ernest Dickerson, Lee really managed to emphasise the hotness of the day. The colour palette is filled with reds and oranges to convey the high temperature and characters are constantly seen sweating to reinforce that aspect. It works so well as the day gets hotter, the tension and conflict begins to rise leading to one of the most explosive third acts in a movie. The film is impeccably shot. Spike Lee brings a lot of style to the way its shot. The close-ups and dutch angles give us so much insight into the nature of the neighbourhood as well up the intensity and anger present in the characters.

Speaking of characters, I love all of them. The film doesn't necessarily have an actual story. It focuses on different characters of different races. All of them are incredibly watchable and interesting. Spike Lee gives each character something that makes them distinct. I don't think I'll forget characters like Radio Raheem, Buggin Out, Sal, Da Mayor and Mookie. All the actors involved do a phenomenal job here. Danny Aiello, Bill Nunn, Spike Lee, Giancarlo Esposito, John Turturro and Ossie Davis are fantastic. I, however, wish the female characters had more to work with.

What really makes Do the Right Thing special is its meaning and themes. Lee loves to explore race in his films and Do the Right Thing is no different. I couldn't believe the third act of this film. It completely shocked me at how relevant it is to this day. It's sad to see issues like racial tension and police brutality still be around in 2020 when Lee showed us this over thirty years ago. It's a very disheartening but powerful ending that makes you wonder how this going to be solved and what exactly is the 'right thing' to do.

Do the Right Thing is a very important and powerful film. It's expertly crafted with incredibly well written and memorable characters that eventually leads to one of the most impactful and relevant endings to a movie ever. Do the Right Thing is a must watch!",9.0,13 November 2020
Would've been better as a short film,,7.0,21 April 2024
It would be the right thing to watch this movie.,"Maybe the heat does make people ready to explode, but never so much as what ""Do the Right Thing"" portrays. It all begins on the hottest day of summer in a borough of New York. African-American Mookie (director Spike Lee) works at Sal's (Danny Aiello) pizzeria. As Sal and his sons are proud of their Italian heritage, they decorate the store with pictures of Italian-Americans. But Mookie's friend Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito) notes that the pizzeria's only patrons are black, so Sal should put up pictures of African-Americans. When Sal refuses, Buggin Out announces a boycott. From there...well, you have to see the movie to really understand it. John Turturro, Bill Nunn, Ossie Davis, and Ruby Dee all provide great support. All in all, this was probably Spike Lee's second best movie behind ""Malcolm X"", and this appears to be where he began his tradition of portraying Italians negatively (continued in ""Jungle Fever"" and the under-appreciated ""Summmer of Sam"").",10.0,25 November 2005
"Good story, amateur execution","I was looking forward to seeing Do the Right Thing, Spike Lee was awarded for the film last year and it was in my book of ""1001 movies you must see before you die"", so when I saw this film at the video store I naturally picked it up and I just watched it tonite. I can see where Spike Lee was going with the film and how angry everyone can get with the heat and just natural accusations due to stereotypes and misunderstandings, but it didn't seem like a strong enough movie that really effected me like Spike's other film 25th Hour.

It's one of the hottest days of the summer and we have a little Italian restaurant in the middle of a black neighborhood. Unfortunately, everyone is starting to gain up on each other due to the nasty heat and making horrible accusations and calling each other horrible names. All the heat and anger just builds up to a very heated and deadly conclusion that everyone could learn from.

Do the Right Thing could've been a stronger movie, I just felt like it wasn't strong enough, I know that I am going to get bashed and insulted for saying that, but I know when a film effects me and why it does and unfortunately Do the Right thing just didn't have me shaking, crying, or made me think after the movie was done. I have just seen Spike's better work, I know this was one of his first films, for that, I admit he did a good job, but it still felt too amateur for my likings.

Do the right thing,,,19 December 2012
One of the best movies I have ever seen,"I did not see this movie when it first came out because I was a young busy white guy engrossed in his life. It may be an advantage that I didn't see it then because I would have misunderstood what a true masterpiece it is. Only recently have I taken a deep interest in the racial, social, political, economic, and environmental issues that now plague the world. Everything about this film is more relevant today than when it was first released. I feel Spike Lee was very kind and generous with what he presented. I am both moved and awed by this film, and it goes to say it stands the test of time. If you ever wanted to try and understand the racial problems we face today and also have a glimpse of hope for a future, I think this journey is well worth your time.",10.0,28 January 2023
"An important piece of work, no matter what age you are or decade you live in","""Are we going to live together? Together, are we going to live?"" Spike Lee's 1989 masterpiece of racism and madness on a hot day in Brooklyn is still one of the true forms of art and of human characteristic. Racism lives on everyday in our lives from schools, work places, the streets, and God knows where else. Ever since Crash won the Academy Award for best picture, I was still infuriated that such a small film about how humans are racist could have a happy ending. Not even Atticus Finch from To Kill A Mockingbird would have anything to say about this and even his character is among the top heroes for thinking racism is bad.

Our hero is no other than Mookie (played by Spike Lee), a young man who's working at a dead end job delivering pizzas so that way he could support his wife (Rosie Perez) and child. Sal's Pizza is where he works at and it's runned by Sal (Danny Aiello) along with his two grown sons played by John Turturro and Michael Edson. Sal has been in the joint since forever and is very kind to all the people no matter what color or background they have. His sons Pino and Vito are very different however. Vito (Edson) is the only son who shows generosity to those around him like his father, where Pino (Turturro) has the hatred for black people and even Mookie gives him a lesson by asking him all the questions from favorite entertainers and all of his answers are African American entertainers (Michael Jackson, Michael Jordan).

There are different characters in this film from Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn of Spider-Man) who carries his boom box everywhere as his heart and soul. There's Da Mayor (Ozzie Davis) who knows everybody's business in Brooklyn. Giancarlo Esposito plays Buggin Out, a black militant who loathes Sal and his restaurant so much that he wants to boycott after seeing that there aren't any African Americans on the wall. Samuel L. Jackson, in a small and good role, plays Mister Senor Love Daddy, Brooklyn's voice where not only does he start his music at six in the morning but is the voice of reason for everybody to chill out.

While there are some moments were you will laugh, there are scenes that make you think about what goes on including a montage where Spike directs scenes of different actors saying about how they feel about the races around them. While it'll make you laugh, it'll make you think about how the human race works.

The last part of the film is an important act where all I have to say is tragedy; even it's final frame doesn't have the answer about the right thing.

""Do the Right Thing"" is not only an important piece of cinema, but an important piece that'll make you think of how we act with one another and hopefully we'll learn to accept those around us despite our differences.",10.0,3 March 2008
Why doesnt everyone know about this film?,,10.0,15 July 2020
It May Be The Greatest Film About Racism Ever Made,"Full of style, color, and humor, Spike Lee's masterpiece ""Do The Right Thing"" takes place during the hottest day of the year in a Brooklyn neighborhood. It explores the issue of racism in a powerful and brutal way, showing how every character has their own prejudices, and how some characters are far more villainous and hateful than others. Eventually, this hatred explodes into a finale that can only be described as shocking and chaotic.

For a large portion of the film, I was smiling and laughing at all of the joyfulness and comedy that is packed into this somewhat depressing story. Although it's about a strong and mature topic, the film itself is entertaining, hilarious, and likable. But, it's still a very heavy film at times as well.

Spike Lee portrays racism in a very powerful and meaningful way, and he doesn't just show whites oppressing blacks, which is refreshing to see, since it's a cliché in a film about race to show that all of the black characters are saints who don't have prejudices of their own. Pretty much every main character in ""Do the Right Thing"" has their own prejudice, some of them have far more mild prejudices than others, and some of them are far more kind than others. Characters like Radio Raheem and (especially) Buggin' Out are very hateful against the whites, and then characters like Pino are very hateful against the blacks. There's also characters who hold strong prejudices against Asian characters, and elderly characters. Overall, the film shows that hate can be inside of anybody, and can be directed to anybody.

Unfortunately, it seems like many people seem to be interrupting the film all wrong. Looking through message boards and reviews, some people may have the idea that ""Do the Right Thing"" supports the actions of Radio Raheem and Buggin' Out, but they're wrong. Based on the film I watched, the Italian pizzeria owner Sal is actually supposed to be somewhat likable. He cares for and likes his customers, unlike his son Pino, a very racist and unsympathetic character, and Pino comes across as the polar opposite as his very likable and friendly brother Vito. Sadly, Sal unleashes all of his hatred at the end of the film, when Buggin' Out and Radio Raheem unleash their own hatred. Mookie, a very likable black character, is also pushed to the limit at the end of the film. So both Sal and Mookie are good people who are pushed to their limit and unleash hatred, while characters like Da Mayor and Vito are never really filled with hate and remain likable for the entirety of the film, and other characters like Buggin' Out and Pino are very racist and unlikable for the entirety of the film.

At least, this is how I interpreted the film.",10.0,25 September 2016

Nothing but love for the block. One of the best movies of all time,"To start with, I honestly don't have enough words to describe this movie. Everything about it is perfect in every single way. It pictures a typical American block with such love, respect and adoration I wish everyone had in their hearts. Each character is so real and complete you can almost feel you know him in real life. Some of them are good, some bad, but no matter what, you feel that they are real. As the story unveils you get to know more and more of each of them: what drives them, why bothers them about their place in life and other people around them. Some say that Spike Lee shots nothing but racial movies, but I don't think he takes any sides. Look at each side in this story, each of them has their own skeletons in their closet and each was ultimately responsible for the events the movie led up to. Well, as I mentioned at the start of this little review, I really can't describe this movie good enough. The story, the casting, the direction and even colouring, are all brilliant. And when I say brilliant i rather mean smth like: it doesn't get any better than this.

Complex slice of life - including what is often invisible,"The subtleties of interactions are amazing here. Note, for example, the racial and ethnic diversity - there are African American blacks, Jamaican American

blacks, Irish American whites, Italian American whites, Puerto Rican Hispanics, Salvadoran Hispanics, Korean Americans, and (by reference) Jewish

Americans. Where are the WASPS? They probably own the brownstones, but

they never show up in the neighborhoods!

I think that Lee sought to show that everybody could be doin' ""the right thing"" by their own code, and yet the people are still jobless and poor and without air conditioning, and there are larger differences in this society.

""Doing the Right Thing"" here means seeking/demanding visibility for minorities that are overlooked, except when they riot. Doing the Right Thing means

operating your restaurant the way you want. Doing the Right Thing means

stopping a violent riot with police force. Doing the Right Thing means insisting on respect for you as a customer and a person (even if you express your person with your music). Each one of these people is trying to do good, and is very human and sometimes falls short. And even that is not enough to provide a

secure life with dignity. Bravo, Spike Lee!",9.0,21 March 2004
Do The Right Thing,,7.0,10 May 2013
Do the right thing...avoid this movie,"I live about two hours away from Seattle, where yesterday some big protest was held over WTO meetings that got so out of hand that police had to use tear gas and such to clear the streets from people who were doing things like smashing windows and vandalising and setting fires. Chances are, I will bet that most of those people have seen and were probably influenced by Do the Right Thing, as were people who caused the LA Riots and probably a lot of other violent protests too. Why? Because to me, this movie sort of gives the impression that that sort of thing is okay to do. Sure, it shows the trouble that people can experience from it(some businesses get ruined and there is a fatality), but it also features the central characters as the ring leaders of the trouble and I don't think these characters are SUPPOSED to be people we don't like or feel for(even though that's what I felt about almost all of them), I think they're supposed to be heroes and ""free spirits"" engaging in obnoxious behavior, which is really sick.

Never has a movie disgusted or angered me more than this piece of worthlessness, which is most certainly high on my list of worst favorite movies. And this is not simply from the protest at the end either, because I was pretty much feeling that way from after about the first five minutes and on, after being introduced to about my least favorite cast of characters ever. Basically, ""Do the Right Thing"" involves a bunch of young punks. One of them is Mookie, played by director Spike Lee, who works at an Italian pizza place with Sal(Danny Aiello) and his sons(John Turturro plays the more promiment one)and hangs out with fellows like Radio Rasheen, a creepy thug who blasts terrible music from a radio he takes with him everywhere, Smiley, a ""nice"" retarded fellow with an annoying stutter, and Buggin' Out(or something like that) a beyond obnoxious and beyond loathsome fellow who does not like Sal's pizzaria because he only hangs up pictures of white people. Anyway, somewhere along the film, Mookie is told by a gent called Da Mayor(Ossie Davis)who old veteren of the slummy neighborhood he lives in that he needs to ""do the right thing,"" which I guess would mean get his life in gear.

That would make it seem like it was going to be some character study completely centering around Mookie, but instead the film primarily focusses on about five different subjects: Mookie and his job at Sal's, Mookie's relationship with his girlfriend(the useless subplot), those terrible friends of Mookie and their crusades around the neighborhood(they try to lobby for that stupid protest and act awful to everyone who passes by), some heat wave(don't ask me why) and racial issues. Race is a very important issue in this film. The cast is mostly portrayed by people in ""minority"" races(African American, Italian American, Korean, Hispanic,etc)and while this could have been a great film about all races learning to accept each other, it instead comes off as a very offensive film about races wanting to stay incredibly exclusive and act hateful to anybody who is not a part of them. It is incredibly ironic that this movie won an award for peace, because the ""right thing"" is engaging in violence and they don't even make the violence look bad. The audience was probably supposed to be all sympathetic when the fire hoses were turned on, but I was so disgusted by the rioting and violence that if those police men had been real I probably would have thanked them or something. I also didn't really mind what they did to Radio Rasheen, though I'm sure I was supposed to.

And I can go on and on about my dislike for this film, but it would probably go long over the 1000 word limit, but just trust me, this is one to be avoided because even slightly redeeming factors in this movie(like Ossie Davis's character) get old very quickly. Also, anybody who does not care for profanity in movies will be turned off from this one because their are literally hundreds of swear words and I am not exaggerating.

The essential Spike Lee joint,"""Do The Right Thing"" couldn't have come at such a perfect time. The tensions between white and black America was brewing and then Spike Lee dropped the bomb with ""Do The Right Thing"". ""Do The Right Thing"" takes place all in one hot summer day in Brooklyn, New York. The day starts off normal. Mookie (Lee) gets up and goes to work. Da Mayor (Davis) is sitting on a porch and getting drunk (as usual). Radio Raheem (Nunn) is walking around Bed Stuy blasting Public Enemy's ""Fight the Power"". Until, Buggin' Out (so brilliantly played by Giancarlo Esposito) goes into Sal's (Aiello) Pizzeria for a slice of pizza and notices no African Americans on his Wall of Fame. This sets off the racial tension that made this film as controversial as it is today. Everything Lee did for this film is perfect. From the choice of music (Public Enemy and the score by his father Bill Lee and Branford Marsalis) to the setting (Brooklyn USA, cant get any better than that). The realism of the film is incredible, you could be watching this in the middle of Winter and still be sweating looking at the hot weather surrounding the characters. ""Do The Right Thing"" has some of the most memorable scenes in movie history (i.e. the scene where Buggin' Out's Air Jordan gets stepped on by a white man). ""Do The Right Thing"" is a masterpiece that went unnoticed by the Academy Awards or the AFI for the Top 100. That year, the Best Picture Oscar went to ""Driving Miss Daisy"". But ""Do The Right Thing"" benefited from all the controversy, there are classes committed to the social statement of ""Do The Right Thing"". What ever happened to ""Driving Miss Daisy""?

Reconciling the teachings of Martin Luther King with that of Malcom X. (minor spoilers),,8.0,25 January 2005
"Worth a ""two-fiddy"" admission!","Spike Lee certainly makes you think. Just when you think he's preaching one way, he turns the tables and appears to proselytize for the other side. In ""Do the Right Thing"", he does exactly that in a story set in a racially charged Brooklyn neighborhood.

Lee plays a slacker pizza delivery kid named Mookie who works for Danny Aiello's ""Sal's Place"". The movie follows his life over the course of one exceptionally hot day, when the heat seems to fuel all of the simmering racial tensions past the boiling point.

There are a lot of great moments in the movie, with bits of humor, anger, and sadness mixing to create a intimate portrayal of life in ""Da Hood"" (or so I would assume). We develop an intimate understanding of all the different factions that contribute to racial outbursts, and come to respect them in turn. Most of the characters are highly sympathetic, and thus Lee's trademark ambiguity comes into play. The done-to-death phrase ""Can't we all just get along?"" comes to mind.

At the heart of this movie is the question of what is the best way to change the system. ""Do the Right Thing"" presents us with two options--the Martin Luther King method of dialogue and concilation vs. the Malcolm X endorsed method of civil disobedience/violence. The movie raises the questions without necessarily offering the answers, and that was perhaps what I enjoyed the most.

I'm rating the joint a 7.5, because I personally don't like my movies too ""rough"", and this one definitely has many of those fuzzy edges. As a morality play though, and as a look into inner-city life with its colorful character, this one is definitely worth a look.",7.0,11 July 2001
Spike Lee's magnum opus,"I was hooked from the very beginning. Rosie Perez dancing to Public Enemy's ""Fight the Power"" is probably one of my favorite opening credits of all-time now. I love it. It sets up the style of the rest of the film with all the tacky bright colored clothes popular in the late 80's early 90's, laid over a warm backdrop of colors that you can feel sizzling until the very end.

So this is Spike Lee's magnum opus, if you will -- his presentation and powerful commentary on race relations and riots. In the sweltering heat, tensions rise between a black neighborhood and the Italian-American owners of Sal's Famous in the Bed-Stuy area of Brooklyn. (a third ""race""/party also exists, Koreans that own a convenient store in the neighborhood, although they are less prominent in the story). Come the end, we question who is right, who is wrong, did Mookie do the right thing? When you watch it, don't deny that you try to come up with answers -- it's just natural to attempt to decide which party is in the wrong. But wait, Spike Lee remains unbiased as he unfolds the story, letting us see that both sides cause extensive and unfixable damages. The fact that we, a people, attempt to even analyze events to decipher who is more wrong enforces his message that he conveys in this film.

Paul Haggis should've seen this before making Crash and he should've taken very careful notes. Spike Lee fleshes out his characters, giving them depth and dimension; they have reason to their emotions and actions. Concerning the screenplay, the conflict is a steady build-up of minor/major events that just blow up in your face -- no melodrama, no ""clever"" plot twists and manipulations. Lastly, he doesn't forcibly shove his message in your face. Remember, Spike Lee didn't make this movie to incite urban riots. He made it to promote tolerance... and I believe it works VERY well if you look at it in the right light.",10.0,2 February 2008

"For Once, Spike Lee Does the Right Thing","For the most part I've stayed resistant to Spike Lee and his movies -- he's usually over indulgent and too heavy handed for my taste. But ""Do the Right Thing"" is the exception. This is a terrific movie about one hot summer day in a New York neighborhood when racial tensions bubble over and people's true colors appear. Speaking of color, the film looks great too. Lee creates a completely unique world for his film to live in, with its own rhythm and vibe. The sets look like Sesame Street, which makes the very real and adult themes the rest of the film deals with that much more powerful by contrast.

This movie features Rosie Perez in the only role I've ever liked her in, and a highlight of the film is the energetic dance she does over the opening credits.

"An amazing achievement that, almost thirty years later, is as relevant as ever","To say that I hadn't seen this film until now is a huge embarrassment. I had never seen a Spike Lee film but it's not hard to know why a film like this raised his profile. Not only is the film a strong political statement (and in that respect, it's an emotionally grueling, uncomfortable, and disturbing experience), but it's also incredibly well written. A film like this has to flesh out its characters and its situations before the storm. It does such a great job of that. The film can be funny until it becomes a real challenging piece of work, and to have both sides of the film only makes it hit that much harder.",,29 March 2017
Powerful Film,This well known film was the creation of Spike Lee as he was both the Director and the Writer of the film. The messages that are translated through this film are very powerful. The video of Rodney King being beaten by cops at the beginning of the movie portrays a powerful message in itself. The message that appears most throughout the film is of racial and race relations. Spike Lee chose a powerful cast of actors to portray the characters that he came up with when writing the movie. I found most of the characters to be exciting and entertaining. I also found it interesting that he cast himself as one of the main character of the movie.,7.0,11 May 2016
Most important movie of the past twenty years,"When I first saw Do the Right Thing as a freshman in 1996, I thought ""Gee, its Spike Lee being a racist. What a surprise."" After having seen it again and again, though, I now realize what an incorrect statement that was. Who else in this world has made a movie about racism and prejudice that speaks to all races, and does it in a fashion that tries to make us all realize that we essentially are all the same? Spike Lee created a masterpiece that still has relevance today.",10.0,18 September 2001

Overrated,"I avoided watching Do The Right Thing for a very long time. I knew that to some the catalyst for the events in the film were essentially the swelling heat and the rising racial tensions. But I also know that if you really wanted to, you could make a case for the catalyst for the tragic events in the movie being the fact that there are no pictures of black people on the wall of the local pizzeria in the movie. Knowing that, that is why I avoided the film for as long as I did. Having watched the film finally, I have to agree, that that really is the catalyst for the events in the movie and it really made me wish I avoided the film for possibly even longer than I did because it just makes the entire movie silly. Let me explain...

Think about it this way: how silly would it be for me to storm the local Thai restaurant near my house (while I crank a boom-box at full-volume like Raheem does in the movie) while exclaiming, ""What's with all of these pictures of Bhumibol Adulyadej on the wall? And who are these other Thai people? Ain't no Thai people in this neighborhood: we got black and white people here, and I ain't see none of them on your wall! I put 'much money' into this place!""--It'd be incredibly ludicrous, right? Look, when I've gone into pizzerias, it doesn't matter what the predominate ethnicity might be in that location of said pizzeria, I'm going to expect to see pictures of Italian people on the walls, or cheesy/hokey murals of Rome, and so on. When I eat at a place that serves ethnic food (or at least food with ethnic overtones), I am not going to expect the place to bend and shape to the ethnicity of the neighborhood it's located in or of myself. Why?--Because that would be stupid.

But if I nit-picked on all of the ""silliness"" of the content within Do The Right Thing, I could be writing for forever. Most people's reviews focus on the content of the film, not the form/craft, so I'm going to make an effort to focus on the latter as much as possible.

Over the film classes I've taken and the books I've read on film, Do The Right Thing has been brought up constantly (and always with high regard). Now actually seeing the movie left me surprised of this, for Do The Right Thing is not a well-made movie. The directing is surprisingly inept, the cinematography is overrated, the acting from the majority of the characters in the film is laughable and unbelievable, the script is flimsy, and the dialogue is utterly groan-worthy.

Speaking of groaning, anytime where there is a scene that they decide to use the incidental music composed for the movie (which is probably about five times during the course of the movie, and often if the scene involves either or both ML and Mother Sister) I dare you to try not to groan. Suddenly the film drastically and abruptly changes from a ""slick and hip"" time-capsule of 1989 to a full-on laughable amateur high-school-produced melodrama. When the syrupy incidental music kicks in with Branford Marsalis' saxophone, and ML asks, ""Is the neighborhood still standing?"" To which Mother Sister replies, ""We're still standing,"" with a straight-face--yeah, I think I punched myself in the face.

One of the biggest annoyances with Do The Right Thing are the constant Dutch angles. See, one would commonly employ a Dutch angle if one wanted to suggest tension, and sure there is that in the movie, but often a Dutch angle is used within Do The Right Thing when people are talking calmly and about nothing at all rendering the angle meaningless when it is constantly used. If the constant Dutch angles were meant to suggest alienation (as they are used for in The Third Man), really they were not used well to even suggest that effect (if that was indeed the desire of Spike Lee, and I don't believe it was, I am just blindly groping for explanations). Seriously, the Dutch angles were in such high use I might as well have been watching an episode of the campy 1960s Batman television show.

A lot of people have praised the cinematography in the film; but seriously, check out almost any David Lean film if you want to see good cinematography (especially his criminally under-watched adaptations of Oliver Twist and Great Expectations). Check out Ford's Grapes of Wrath, or any Kubrick or Renoir, and so on. Oh, and yes, almost every film textbook I ever had praised the originality of how Spike Lee used a color palette primarily consisting of reds, yellows and oranges to help communicate the heat. Really? I am confused as to why people act as though Spike Lee was original in doing such a thing. Since technicolor first came about, directors and cinematographers used the same trick to communicate heat or cold, and even before that during the silent-film era, they used to tint the film of certain scenes different colors to suggest heat or cold (or night or day, as well as other things).

I could go on and on, but I have written too much already (IMDB has a 1000 word limit). As I watched the film, my opinion of it steadily declined. But I think when Radio Raheem made his awkward reference to Night of The Hunter--that is when my opinion of the film truly plummeted. I have a rule: Don't remind me of a good movie during your bad movie, because you just make me want to watch that said good movie instead of your piece of steaming crap (example: Kill Bill referencing Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia, Fever Pitch referencing Annie Hall, Cocktail featuring Casablanca, and so on).",4.0,13 December 2007
Spike Lee's The Godfather,"I really couldn't say enough about this film. I could even go ahead and say it could be one of my all time favorite movies. Just so much packed into the time allotted. Beautiful funny relatable and just bizarre movie. Doesn't get any better than the cinematic experience of this film.

The plot. We are following around a young pizza delivery guy in a ghetto area of New York. His experiences with the girlfriend he has a child with, the pizza place he works at, and all the random characters that walk the streets looking to get their fill of the day. The movie ends in a massive climax of the pizza place being burned to the ground, and the aftermath of the characters.

Is it trying to tell us something about civil rights or the poor black community? Who knows. This is a story about life. And just as good as any other movie out there.

Spike Lee's character is cinematic perfection.

Spike Lee is wonderful,"Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing is a powerful film with a phenomenal cast. Everyone gives a strong performance and causes the viewer to feel engaged in the film's concentrated plot. Every person in the film seems real. I loved the beginning sequence of the film. The girls' dancing was entertaining and a great way illustrate the time period of the film. Do the Right Thing is extremely emotional. The concept and plot is a touchy subject, and Lee clearly casts himself as Mookie to reveal his views on the issues at hand. This is a wise decision, for Lee effectively plays the confused, yet passionate character. Mookie is a very complex character whom one must thoroughly analyze in order to somewhat understand. In addition, the coloring of the film was intense, which added to what was going on on screen.

Although the racial tension was extremely disturbing and strong, it was accurately depicted. It was heartbreaking to watch the cops strangle Radio Raheem. It was if the cop subconsciously knew he was killing the boy, but just could not stop himself. The riot was especially upsetting, for everything went out of control because different ethnic groups could not get along. Spike Lee does a great job of recuperating after the film's wild climax. The viewer feels a huge sense of relief after the horrible and severe fight scene is over, and Lee shows that the community has calmed down as well. Do the Right Thing is a thought-provoking and expressive film that fully deserves all its praise.",9.0,30 March 2005

There were a lot of quick cuts that were necessary to truly pull off the movie and have it leave such a lasting effect on those who watched it. I am also happy to say that the sound played a huge role for me in this film because it helped me to understand just a little bit more what the people in the different situations were going through.

Danny Aiello's performance is stupendous. He carries the movie. His character is the catalyst for the entire story. Ozzie Davis too delivers a tremendously evocative performance as does the rest of the cast. But what makes this movie so special is the way it presents a story about racial conflict in a straight forward manner without any value judgments. That is, the director, Spike Lee, sets forth the story and leaves it to the audience to decide what the story is actually about. The title of the movie spells out the movie's theme as the characters are forced to come to terms with their true feelings, and to decide what is right for them. The movie is about people in crisis, and it is a movie that is well worth watching.",10.0,21 April 2012

"Not the most subtle film, but unfortunately one of the most honest.","Do the Right Thing is an exercise in style over substance, of adrenalin and bravado trumping plot and realism, of a message beaten into submission through sheer weight of numbers.

The opening scene is basically a music video, one that has nothing to do with the film aside from setting the tone. That does not mean that Do the Right Thing is somehow not an important movie, far from it. It is an at times psychedelic headf*ck, a mish-mash of random movement and broadly drawn caricatures of various generations, backgrounds and ethnicities.

As we are told all too many times the film takes place on an especially hot day in New York as a bright colourful array of broadly drawn characters go about their everyday business. For many that's simply hanging on street corners commenting on passers by, for the homeless man known as the Mayor (Ossie Davis) that means cadging enough cash to buy a beer, for various shop keepers that means running a business where the clientele openly resent them – or at least their background.

Most notably this includes Sal's pizzeria where the aforementioned Sal (Danny Aiello), his two sons Vito (Richard Edson) and Pino (John Turturro), and delivery boy Mookie (Spike Lee). (As something to do with nothing our family dog is named Mookie, though not for this film, for ex-Atlanta Hawks PG Mookie Blaylock.)

As the day progresses and the temperature soars the normally barely convivial relationships between neighbours and acquaintances fray, with tempers simmering in the heat. It seems that people of every ethnicity have issues with those of other races and religions, and that on this particular day hiding these resentments and opinions is not high on the priorities list.

In the middle of all this is Sal's, a pizzeria in a predominantly black community with a black clientele that proudly hangs numerous pictures of Italian-Americans on its walls. Son Pino openly resents both his situation and customers, Mookie wants to hold onto his job but is constantly having his patience tested by Pino's poking and prodding, and Sal is proud of his business and standing in the community, and seems to genuinely not see things as being defined by colour or race.

There are a lot of subplots and peripheral characters in Do the Right Thing who serve little other purpose but to show the extent of the melting pot, to keep the blood pumping and the film moving at 100 mph, eventually though many of these characters converge on Sal's at almost the same time, and the tense interactions and stress of the day all come to a head.

I won't betray the ending of the film here, especially given that it is really the only major plot development in a film which up to that point was all build up putting several characters on an inevitable collision course.

The film is exceptionally edited to remain in perpetual motion, a blur of vivid colour, profane dialogue and loud conversations and rants peppered with casual (and sometimes inferred) racism.

Danny Aiello and John Turturro both have very brave performances, and I say that realising that 'brave' is a descriptor used all too frequently in film, but here it couldn't be more apt.

Equally brave and amazing is the writing and directing job done by Knick fan #1, Mr Spike Lee, here still a scrawny chicken legged kid, and realistically one who some twenty years later has still not topped this film.

I wonder if two decades on Spike/Mookie would make the same decisions and take the same actions if faced with a similar situation he did in 1989. Actually my main hope is that the casual racism and resentment has somewhat abated from the levels shown in this film, and far more clumsy lesser films such as Crash.

And if you have to have one song played about 237 times in a film, I'm just glad it was Public Enemy's 'Fight the Power', and not a million other crappy songs.

Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. Do the Right Thing might not be the most subtle film to deal with the topic, unfortunately it might be the most honest.",8.0,1 March 2012
"Hard to watch, but a must see",,8.0,18 December 2012
review,"The plot in the movie Do The Right Thing is the Asian and Italians doing business in an African neighborhood. Sal is the owner of the pizzeria shop in a Brooklyn neighborhood and Mookie an African American boy works for him. Across the street from the pizzeria a couple from Korea that owns a convenience store. The major characters' name are Mookie, Da Mayor, Radio Raheem, Sal, Pino, Vito, Buggin out, Jade, Mother- Sister, Samuel, and Mister Senior Love Daddy.

The theme of the movie is going the right thing. The Mayor stopped Mookie while he was on his way to deliver a pizza and told him to do the right thing. The Mayor saw a boy crossing the street and was going to get hit by a car so Mayor pushed him, so that he didn't get hit by a car.

Sal son Pino hated working for his dad in an African American neighborhood. Pino said maybe we should sell this place why we are still ahead in life. Pino also said maybe we should open a pizzeria in our own neighborhood. Sal said that there is a lot of pizzeria already; he has been here 25 years where is he going. Pino says he is sick of ""niggers""; it's like when he comes to work its like plant of the apes and he don't like being around them animals. Pino also told Vito not to trust Mookie because he will back stab you. This shows the prejudice among the minority themselves.

One of Mookie friends name Buggin Out, went to the pizzeria and notice on the wall that there were no pictures of any African Americans on his wall. Buggin Out was trying to get a group of people together to boycott the pizzeria. Radio Raheem agreed to boycott the pizzeria with Buggin Out. Radio Raheem and Buggin Out went to the pizzeria with Radio Rhaeem's radio blaring. Sal didn't like it, so Sal got out his baseball bat and smashed the radio into pieces. Radio Raheem got very mad, so they all started fighting. The NYPD came out to break it up, so they pulled Radio Raheem off of Sal. The NYPD killed Radio Raheem. This started a riot against Sal and the Korean. Mookie then picked up a trash can and threw it at the window of the pizzeria shop. Then the whole neighborhood damaged the place and lights the place on fire. Buggin Out was the one that started the whole thing and I feel is responsible for Radio Raheems dead. Once they did that they turned to the Korean and the Korean said I am the same as you. They left them alone.

When Jade went to the pizzeria to eat and Sal was being overly nice to her, Mookie did not like it. So Mookie grab her hand and took her to the side of building and was talking to her. I think that part didn't look natural. It looked reddish and brown, the building even looked fake.

This just shows that doing the right thing is appropriate. Make sure you think before you do something. Violence is not the key to everything. I also think that Mookie betrayed the Sal, because he threw the trash can and broke the window. If it wasn't for that, I don't think they would of damage the place.",,27 July 2011
Spike Lee proves his ability,"Do the Right Thing by Spike Lee highlights much of the racial tensions that people experienced during that time period and may very well still experience today. the themes of race vs. race plays a major role in the movie and is interesting because it is such an issue in today's world. the depiction of the different characters around Bedford-Stuyvesant, or better known as Bed-Stuy, was very interesting in how it showed the different viewpoints of the various people. one character, Sal, played by Danny Aiello, is detailed in-depth and shows that even when facing tough times, it is important to still be fair to everyone. Spike Lee is able to showcase the destruction that hate and lack of reasoning can have on a community.",7.0,13 May 2015
Same Old Story Repeated Again and Again,"I saw this movie for the first time very recently and it's fascinating to see how little things have changed since then in the USA. In the 2020s, there might be more people on cell phones, fashions may be different, and perhaps filmmakers use different techniques and equipment, but otherwise this movie could have been filmed in 2021. The setting, characters, and themes remain very relevant.

This is a story about racial tensions in a black neighborhood and it tries to cover diverse viewpoints broadly. The story centers around Sal's Pizzeria, an Italian shop in this neighborhood manned by one of the ""white"" holdouts who is providing services to the locals and his two sons. While he mostly stays on good terms with his customers and tries to see each of them as individuals. He displays warm feelings toward Mookie as well as many of his customers, but he also has a short fuse.

The main black character is Mookie, who works as a delivery boy in the pizzeria. He tries to work as a mediator between the crew of Sal's Pizzeria and the black residents, knowing he needs the money Sal pays him to survive but also seeming to feel some sort of affinity to him and his family.

Cultural misunderstandings, stubbornness, and tiny grievances add up, however, and even level-headed Mookie and Sal, which are the most culturally well-adjusted characters, lose their cool on this hot summer day. In the end, we are reminded of the Bismack quote about World War I, viz, that it would be kicked off by some ""silly little thing in the Balkans.""

The wounds between the communities run so deep and so old that even something as silly as not having pictures of any black people in a pizzeria, being a little too friendly with a woman, or being asked to turn one's music down becomes a spark that lights this conflagration and leads to the explosive conclusion.

This is a masterpiece of ethnic relations where a pizza shop on a nondescript corner in a nameless black neighborhood becomes a representation of human tribalism that has existed from the beginning of human history and shows no signs of abating. When two different groups are forced to stay in contact and they don't respect each other's boundaries, the tinder of rage will just go on piling up until it gets to a point where any small flame becomes an existential danger to it.

Can it be fixed? Can it be avoided? Probably, but the film offers no solutions. It's not about that.

Honourable Mentions: The Kite Runner (2007). Another pretty effective movie about racial tensions in Afqanestaan. In this case it's more about the drama of the story than about exploring the theme, but a good movie nonetheless!",10.0,24 October 2021

"Important, Smart & Unforgettable!","How often do we see a film as powerful & engrossing as 'Do the Right Thing'? I mean this was way back in 1989, when Producer/Writer/Director Spike Lee blew up the big-screen with a hard-hitting, gut wrenchingly honest story on racism, that, sadly, remains timely to this day. And despite choosing a subject as grim as this one, Lee, the genius, presents it like an entertainer, that never comes across as a lecture or a depressing experience. It roars without ever screaming at your face!

'Do the Right Thing' Synopsis: On the hottest day of the year on a street in the Bedford- Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, everyone's hate and bigotry smolders and builds until it explodes into violence.

'Do the Right Thing' is about people engulfed with hate & pressure, despite having the ability to 'love'. Spike Lee delivers an important, smart & unforgettable tale on racism & its pointlessness, with interestingly diverse characters, right from White, Black, Italian & Asian. Lee has Written each character with a distinctive personality, thus, making them all interesting, a few even being memorable.

The climax here is a reflective & provocative one, one that truly asks you the question - Why is this happening & if there is a problem, is the solution always this ruthless? I won't give away spoilers, as there might be some readers out who are yet to see this film. But, Lee's question in the finale will throw you in a tightrope & you'll have to figure yourself who actually you stood for & why. Its truly thought-provoking!

Lee's Writing is masterful. His Screenplay is among the most important ones Cinema has Produced. Its intense, intelligent, volatile & entirely engrossing, all at the same time. Lee's Direction is Fantastic. He has handled this terrific film, with a touch of realism, that's so rare in movies nowadays. Special Mentions for Ernest Dickerson's Cinematography, Barry Alexander Brown's Editing & The Excellent Art & Costume Design.

Now coming to the Performances: Lee shines an an actor as well. He embodies the central part with unmistakable honesty. But the show- stealer here is undoubtedly Danny Aiello. In his portrayal of Sal the pizzeria owner, Aiello is simply astonishing. Right from his body-language to his powerful dialogue delivery, Aiello offers a true acting masterclass! Its among the finest performances of all-time & there is no exaggeration here!

Of the rest of the cast, John Turturro is remarkable as Aiello's conflicted son Pino, while The Late/Great Ruby Dee is haunting as Mother Sister. The Late/Great Ossie Davis as Da Mayor, is wonderfully restrained. The Late/Great Bill Nunn is excellent & Rosie Perez as Tina, in her breakout role, is feisty. Rest lend great support.

On the whole, 'Do the Right Thing' is a powerful piece of modern cinema. Its a film that demands your attention, asks you questions & never forgets to keep you engrossed. This one's a MASTERPIECE!",10.0,7 August 2017
"The Right Thing, Eh?","Any piece of film that leaves you asking questions about yourself and your own morality has certainly done the job it's intended to. And in Spike Lee's seminal 1989 slice of life drama ""Do the Right Thing,"" Lee forces us to ask ourselves what exactly that right thing is.

Lee plays the main character, Mookie, as he struggles through inner-city life working for a somewhat racist Italian pizza shoppe owner. When an altercation at the pizza place leads to a death of Mookie's friend, and racial tensions rise, Mookie is left with no choice but to start destroying the pizza place, lest the angry mob turns their hatred towards the actual owners.

In that space, Lee challenges us to wonder if what Mookie does is right. The film itself portrays the in-your-face nature of an entropic urban project, complete with homages to 80's rap videos of the day and graffiti of the town's one and only hero, Mike Tyson. That in it of itself should explain what's wrong with the town, but Lee challenges us to look further than surface level.

And that's what this film does so well, is make you believe that this is almost a documentary, not a stylized film. And in that, Lee succeeds tremendously.",9.0,10 May 2010
A Spike Lee instant classic1,"I watched this film again recently for the ninth time and still think it's one of a truly talented director's best.I myself am a huge Spike Lee fan and i have recently watched '25th hour'which i feel is already one of my all time favourite films and knew that as soon as i saw it and i just thought how funny it is that Spike has never made a bad film!i mean are there any bad Spike Lee films? all have been amazing right from '25th hour'right down to his first feature 'She's gotta have it'which was back in 1986. It just makes you think what an amazing film maker/storyteller he is and 'Do the right thing' is a perfect example of that. This is such a powerful movie and is probably the best when it comes to the subject of racial tension between whites and blacks living in the same neighbourhood, the acting is also amazing even when it was the roles of newcomers such as Martin Lawrence,Rosie Perez and even Sam Jackson.But my favourite is still Bill Nunn who plays the ultra cool 'Radio Raheem'.Amazing.10 out 10.",,22 December 2004
"""Do the right thing.""","A statement, just as plain as any. But when particular circumstances arise, or situations occur, are packed full of meaning. In the film, the title is actually said, and the decision is felt by all in the neighborhood. The way Spike Lee isn't afraid when it comes to dialogue, and his portrayal of the human situation is what made this film great. Because, instead of having this film being an ideal or a ""portrayal"", his film I can feel is the real deal. Many portrayals nowadays take artistic liberties or clean something up to make it more appropriate for viewing audiences, or more intense to shock them. Even though this film was made over 20 years ago, with the recent spike of public interest in the ""Black lives matter"" movement, we can all connect to this film in someway. Whether we are taking direction or passive action, standing up and observing, or simply just having a stereotype or certain ways of thinking and feeling expected of you due to the color of your skin. In this film, we have Mookie. He's African American, and everyone at his job, is Caucasian. The owner as well as the owner's sons/employees. There's a Korean mart across the street. And the neighborhood is predominantly occupied by African Americans. So in Lee's film, he explores the tension and day-to-day interactions by this close proximity of mixed skin colors and races in his 1989 film, Do The Right Thing.",7.0,10 May 2016
Painfully Inspiring,"""Do the Right Thing"" (1989) is a comedic drama about racial tensions in Brooklyn, New York. There are several notable characters in this film, but Mookie, played by Spike Lee, has the spotlight. When I originally watched this film almost 20 years ago, I felt a sense of pride that the black community stood up. When watching it today, I feel anger in my compassion because I sincerely believe that had everyone spoke with a little more respect to one another, the tension would have been slighted resulting in an alternate ending. Overall, my emotions don't affect my opinion of this being an outstanding film.

Spike Lee is an amazing writer and director that puts the hard truth on the big screen for the world to take notice. This film is the epitome of not only what was happening then, but what is still happening today. The acting was mostly spot on for the era and location, but the exception is Spike Lee himself. He appeared very stiff and out of place through most of the film, but it didn't detract from the message. His multiple uses of unconventionally canted shots added a complex level to the scenarios that adds tremendously to the story. Even though watching this film now hurts my heart, it is a classic that should be viewed by everyone, particularly those who need an inside look into lower class minority communities.",9.0,25 July 2018

"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll definitely be moved","I was sitting in my high school film class one day and my teacher mentioned we would be watching Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" to help us [students] understand racial perspective in film. I didn't think much of it at first, but when he finally put the tape on, I don't think I can ever forget this film.

Spike Lee takes you into brooklyn like no other director has. Through very extreme (but very real) characters, Spike shows you that no matter what, there are and will always be prejudices, but that they can be overcome. I can honestly say that it is one of the most disturbingly real and moving movies ever made. I've never laughed so hard and I've never cried so hard.

I encourage anyone to watch it twice, once for enjoyment, and the second time to reflect on yourself. Black or White this movie will stir up some major emotions inside. If you've seen American History X, see Do the Right Thing and see how a black director portrays racism. If you aren't moved by this film, watch it until you are.",10.0,2 July 2001
My Favorite Movie,"Spike Lee's film opens with an incredibly long opening credits featuring a woman (Rosie Perez), dancing/boxing angrily at the screen with Public Enemy's ""Fight the Power"" in the background screaming. It is already clear this movie involves anger and frustration. Finally it says ""Written, Produced and Directed by Spike Lee"", and the movie begins.

It starts by showing members of the Bed-Stuy community, a multiracial but predominately black neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. Every character is interesting, funny, and unique. It is summer 1989 and the day it takes place is on a scorcher. While every character is different, they all have the heat in common.

Soon enough tension rises between the characters and violence breaks out. The characters are all clearly biased and discriminatory between the other races, and eventually it all comes out in an intense climax.

But the beauty of the film is the almost perfect balance of comedy and drama. The first hour will have you laughing out loud, and by the second hour you are riveted, scared, and most importantly moved. The experience is unforgettable. Do the Right Thing is my favorite movie.",10.0,24 June 2008
An Amazing Film,"Many see this film as too stereotypical of the different races. But isn't that the way a lot of people saw these races, especially in the time period? The film blends the quotes from the great black leaders Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. When is violence OK? Many say never...especially in present day. But put yourself in that area in that time period and with all the messed up stuff that was happening to the African American race. White cops killing black kids and getting away with it. Multiethnic neighborhoods ridden with crime and poverty and no one doing a damn thing about it.

I think this is one of the most amazing films ever made. Spike Lee doesn't give you any answers...he leaves it to you to decide whether Mookie was right or wrong with his actions. Any film that leaves you pondering for hours and hours on end is extraordinary.",,29 November 2004
Really good.,"Really really good film. This is one of the few comedies that turns ugly and is completely understandable. Let me explain- it's about Race. In Brooklyn, on the hottest day of the year. It starts out very funny, this was back when Spike Lee was still kind of charming like Woody Allen, and then it kicks you in the head! It turns really ugly, but by then you already know and love most of the characters. Featuring a star making performance by Rosie Perez, and great work by everybody in it, this is Spike Lee's best work I think. The music is a little heavy handed, but even that worked for me in this film. Rent it!",7.0,28 June 2001
Undoubtedly One of The Best and Most Innovative Films of the 1980s,"Spike Lee has been up and down as a director, but this film is clearly one of the best of the last few decades, and cements Lee's place as one of the most talented contemporary directors.

I think he did,"As I sat in the gymnasium watching a generic presentation on violence in America, on how racial hate leads to violence, I said to myself, ""We'd all be a lot better off watching Spike's 'Do the Right Thing' instead of this no-effect propaganda."" That first time I saw it (Do the Right Thing) was one of those rare film experiences, not one that left you in awe or amazement, but one that really made you question the morality and decency of the human race. And the great thing is that it did exactly what that presentation I saw in the gym didn't do, it had you look within yourself and ask those questions: ""Do I contribute or do I try and stop it? Or do I just let it slide and keep on living my seemingly undisturbed life?"" I live in a part of New England where these issues don't really affect me, so I really could not say. But then I realized that that was a cop-out, kind of like how one of the three black men on the street corner in Lee's film says how he's tired of the excuse that they don't own a store because they're black. Well I got tired of doing the same thing when it came to racism: it doesn't affect me. Very few films can change one's ways of living, but this one does. Spike Lee's film will always be an extraordinary work of art. Like Steinbeck's 'Of Mice and Men', it asks us to look at ourselves and examine the way we live: how we judge, act towards one another, discriminate and so on. If ever you really want to see a film that is social consciously effective, then 'Do the Right Thing' is one of the most important to experience.",10.0,27 February 2002
Do the Right Thing,"There were parts I liked in Do the Right Thing and parts I didn't like. The camera had kind of a red tint to it throughout the movie that I noticed, probably to show how hot it was I'm guessing. The movie takes place in Brooklyn and is about a young African American man named Mookie who works delivering pizzas at the local pizzeria owned by an Italian named Sal. Sal built the pizza shop himself and has been delivering and working in Mookie's neighborhood for a long time, a lot of the residents talk about how they grew up on Sal's food. One day while at the pizzeria, a young African American man confronts Sal about the wall of fame he has in the shop. It was full of white people and he wanted him to put some black people on the wall but Sal responded with ""when you get your own store you can do whatever you want"" and refused to put up anyone else on his wall of fame. The young man tried to get the neighborhood to boycott Sal's pizza but no one agrees to do it at first. Sal's son hates the neighborhood and wants them to movie their business but Sal refused, Sal's son and Mookie argue constantly about race and things like that. One man in the neighborhood, Radio Raheem, carries a radio around with him no matter where he goes and blasts rap music. However, when he went into sals with it blasting he screamed at him to turn it off or he wouldn't serve him. That night radio Raheem returns blasting his radio in the store and refuses to turn it off until Sal changes his wall of fame, so Sal smashed it with a baseball bat. This lead to total chaos, the neighborhood guys started fighting sal and his sons. When the police came, they grabbed radio Raheem off of sal and put him in a chokehold and ending up killing him. This just got the crowd even more fired up. Mookie even throws a trash can through Sal's window and they destroy Sal's pizzeria and set it on fire. The movie ends with Sal paying Mookie for his weeks work and the two having a talk. I felt really bad for Sal and his business being destroyed. I don't think Mookie did the right thing by throwing the trashcan through the window which ultimately lead to the complete destruction of the pizzeria. However, it was interesting to see how much that movie has in common with what is going on in our country right now with police brutality and race issues.",6.0,13 May 2015
A subtle American classic...,"Is DO THE RIGHT THING one of the few real masterpieces of American cinema to be made during the last few decades? Yep. Do the characters in the film represent heroes or role models? Nope.

I've always been amused at some of the reactions this film has provoked, most of all the offense, which ignores a psychological component of DO THE RIGHT THING that remains ever present, though far off in the background: how pain and rage can obliterate logic and righteousness, propelling individuals with untapped intellect and creativity into fits of destructive, or self-destructive nihilism. It's rather silly to acknowledge what was inflicted upon African-Americans from the 16th century to (at least) the 1960s, then expect the same people to not carry collective rage and psychological scars after the passage of a few pieces of civil rights legislation. Expecting instant forgiveness (towards white legislative saviors) after 400+ years of every kind of degradation possible is laughable. This is not to justify wanton violence - but without understanding how history can affect psychology at both individual and collective levels, you're going to be utterly lost in this film.

Seeing this process in action is where the real tension and greatness in DO THE RIGHT THING is to be found - I can't think of another film in existence that articulates this unconscious rage - a depressingly ubiquitous undercurrent in the American psyche that unfortunately seems permanent. I don't think anything shown in this film is justified or worthy of emulation, but that isn't the point. There is an underclass in urban America (not exclusively African-American either) that was written off by many in the wake of the rioting of the late 60s, and abandoned by the exodus to suburbia that also began in the 60s. This same underclass is told with increasing vehemence to shape up, prosper and restore communities that have had role models, money and intellect drained out of them in recent decades (and beaten out of them before). In such a setting, the intelligence and energy of whoever is still around will come into conflict with their own anger, resentment and confusion, and within this setting nihilism, frontier justice of a variety and self-destruction almost start to seem sensible.

As an anti-heroic film, DO THE RIGHT THING fits comfortably into the tradition of THE WILD BUNCH, BONNIE & CLYDE or A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. As with those films, the viewer has to acknowledge the humanity and disoriented intelligence of the characters, especially when confronted with their lack of nobility. Stark and raw, viewers could easily be put off by the location of this antiheroic drama in an inner city, but this is far closer to truth - for better or worse - than any bleeding-heart Hollywood credit-to-one's-race fluff.

A brilliant, complex and very subtle film if you bother to look below the surface.",10.0,18 September 2003
A Classic for All,"Spike Lee's third film, Do the Right Thing, is a true classic in every way that a film can be considered a classic. It has some of the best cinematography and uses of color ever in film. The acting is excellent, and every roll is played extremely well.

What always intrigues me about the movie is that this movie is really made to be enjoyed by everyone. This movie deals with how African-Americans are still not treated as equals in our society, and how one neighborhood deals with these racial tensions during the hottest day of the year in New York. Spike Lee does such a good job presenting this theme that everyone no matter of race, sex, or creed can fully empathize and connect with the characters in this movie. Everyone can feel the tension and understand the problems. Everyone can almost feel the heat acting as a catalyst. And most of all, we can see how abuse and hatred of our fellow man can lead great unneeded conflict.

I love this movie. This is defiantly one of the best films I have ever seen, and I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone. It really is a true classic of American cinema.",10.0,4 July 2002
An Artists Masterpiece,"Along with ""Grand Canyon"" and ""Boyz in the Hood,"" it always amazed me how prophetic ""Do the Right Thing"" became in real life.

I studied ""Do the Right Thing"" for it's visual textures and ability to gather powerful emotion, dropping down like a finely timed wave.

one of thee greatest films ever made,"Perhaps it will take another decade or two, maybe even more, but once someone says, ""Hey, let's take another look at that film"" from that distance, hopefully it will finally get the recognition it deserves. This film is a Spike Lee film, by which I mean no other director could have made this film. No other director could have said what Lee said with this film, showed what he showed... Now, try to compare this film to any other films out there, even his own. I cannot think of one single other film out there that really gets into the issue of racism and presents an intelligent analysis of it quite so well as this one. Do the Right Thing takes on this issue of racism and shows us all the complications and complexities of it. What is the right thing? For each culture it is something completely different. And the right thing can simultaneously be the wrong thing. No character is without flaw, no character is without redeeming qualities. Someday I hope this film will be recognized for the brilliant work it is. Do the Right Thing needs to be placed up there with other similar groundbreaking or landmark films like Midnight Cowboy, Cool Hand Luke, or The Best Years of Our Lives. Spike Lee, although respected by many, is equally snubbed and misunderstood by many more. But whether he [ticks] you off or enlightens you (as he has me), he has still made an impact, made you think.

Who did the right thing?,"Do the right thing takes place during a very hot summer day where racial tensions are building up. What do the right thing does right is making this little neighborhood feel alive. This is achieved by making every character seem relevant in story. Each character is given just the right time to ease their self in our mind allowing us to believe that even after the movie ends, the neighborhood continues to live.

Why I think do the right thing is important is because even after the civil rights movement, people thought racism was coming to an end. Spike Lee wanted to show in this movie, that race relationships in America are still a problem. Even to this day, this movie still applies and could be made today and it would affect me the same way.

In terms of actual technical skill, the movie feels different. Spike lee films in unusual ways, he keeps the camera moving. He keeps it upbeat, he keeps it fresh and he keeps it interesting.

The performances are great and if there was one stand-out it would have to be Sal.

Overall, a very thought-provoking movie that makes you pondering race relations. No matter what your color is.",10.0,24 August 2016
The thing about this film is....,"""Do the Right Thing"" is a film from 1989 directed and written by Spike Lee who also stars in the movie. The rest of the cast includes Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Richard Edson, Giancarlo Esposito, Bill Nunn, and John Turturro.

The story takes place in the city of New York City, New York in the area of Brooklyn within the neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant. It is on one of the hottest days in the summer. The story follows the adventures of a young African-American man named Mookie who lives with his sister and works as a delivery man for a middle-aged American-Italian man named Sal who owns the local pizza parlor, ""Sal's Famous Pizzeria.""

Mookie's heart is not into his job at all, and doesn't take it very seriously and often slacks off from it much to Sal's dislike. Mookie also has a three-year old son with his girlfriend Tina, but is too scared to marry her, move in together, and settle down.

""Sal's Famous Pizzeria"" has been standing proudly in the neighborhood for twenty-five years. Sal, and his two sons Pino and Vito are few of the only white men who work in the area which is predominantly African-American. The neighborhood was originally a largely Italian-American neighborhood until the 1960's during the civil rights movement when black people moved into the neighborhood, which caused many of the local Italians to move out.

Sal's oldest son Pino, is a huge racist and hates having to work in a black neighborhood. Pino makes it very clear that he doesn't enjoy his job and that he hates black people. Sal's other son, Vito is more open toward blacks and just the opposite of Pino, and has a good friendship with Mookie.

One of Sal's regular customers, ""Buggin' Out"" notices that Sal's wall of fame in the restaurant only has pictures of Italians. He asks Sal why there are no black people on the wall, and Sal tells them that this is his place, and Italian people are to be all the wall only. Buggin' Out argues that because mostly black people spend their money in there that they do have some say over the creative control of the business. This idea does not go over too well with Sal, and he kicks Buggin' Out to the streets. Buggin' Out then plans to organize a boycott of Sal's pizzeria and goes on a quest to find those who will join him.

There are other little story lines and characters within the film, but the one I described above is the main plot of the story.

It's an interesting, thought provoking film that I think everyone should see. It's a little disturbing and not a feel good movie. It's also just a tiny bit dated (but the 80's theme is all apart of the appeal in my view) the film is kinda cheesy in some parts too, but again, it is apart of the appeal of the movie. There's also some reverse racism that goes on that is intended to be comical to black audiences, but I found it to be offensive and mean.

On that note, in many of Spike Lee's movies he often has his Italian characters as either being racist bullies that the audience are suppose to hate, or unintelligent people who the audience is suppose to laugh at, and we see both of that in the characters of Pino and Vito.

There are honestly no classic cinema good guys in this film. (which is not exactly a bad thing since it makes the film more realistic.) Not even the main character Mookie is someone I would call a hero. He doesn't set a very good example for the audience. He's a complete slacker when it comes to his job, and only cares about getting paid, and yet he doesn't do much to earn the money.

Spike Lee presents a very realistic and honest look at culture clashes that sadly exist in the United States of America. Now while it's true that I personally haven't been involved with too many race conflicts, thank goodness...all one has to do is observe history, read a newspaper or watch the news to see the realism in ""Do the Right Thing"" that is just as alive now that it was in 1989.

The thing about this film is that almost no one is nice. Almost everyone is a very rude jerk with no manners. Some might think this movie stereotypes New Yorkers, but there were mostly New York actors in it. I can see why NYC has the rep that it does (at least among some of the people I know) for it's rudeness, and this movie does not deny it. In most cases, anytime a person is rude to another person, that person will often react by also being ruder, and that happens often in this film, and so much violence and drama could have been avoided in this picture if one person could have turned the other cheek, swallowed their pride, been polite and unselfish. I think the movie is very realistically because in real life, the exact same thing I said above applies to everyday violent human events.

The title ""Do the Right Thing"" is interesting...because no one does the right thing.",7.0,6 August 2017
Spike Lee's contempt for white America on display,"I would not go so far to say this movie is terrible. I would say it is self-important, immature, obvious, and overwhelmingly one-sided. it seems Spike Lee does not believe there are any white people alive who are not either stupid, racist, phony, or downright evil. The movie chronicles a hot summer day in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. It's actually remarkably easy to be robbed, beaten within an inch of your life, and left for dead in that area. But you would never guess it to watch this movie. The residents are all merely misunderstood, mistreated and put upon. The only crime that exists is ""phony crime"",...crime that the white man forces the inhabitants to commit. The police are corrupt racists. A riot may occur, people may be beaten, stores may be burned - but that's only because this is such a horrible racist society. There's a white character (Danny Aiello) who one might think at first is a decent person, but don't be fooled - he's just a closet racist. He patronizes blacks and has desires for Spike Lee's teenage sister. One of his sons is a weak simpleton, the other is the ""evil"" brand of white racist. It is such a tragedy that good and evil, black and white, must exist side by side in an environment where the evil is empowered (the police, the storeowner with money/capital/power) to make the lives of the good (the black) so much worse. But c'est la vie,..Spike doesn't mess with fantasy, only with reality. And his reality is black and white. It is in fact fantasy, and pure propaganda, but Hollywood loves it.",1.0,23 February 2001
Spike Lee's masterpiece,"Spike Lee directs a brilliant film about a sweltering day in a diverse Brooklyn Neighborhood. The film confronts racism head on. The film deals with the ideals of militant and passive ways of dealing with discrimination.

The film does not truly center around one character but a community with all its diversity whether it be the Italians who own Sal's pizzeria(a main fixture in this movie as it introduces many of the characters, the group of Hispanic boys, the yuppy white man, the Korean owners of a shop, or the African-Americans who also live there.

I found it astonishing how Buggin' Out could make such a big deal about his Air Jordans being ruined by the white bicyclist. Here, in Hawaii, we would be frustrated if somebody accidentally ruined our new sneakers. But we wouldn't make it a racial issue and intimidate whoever made the mistake.

Pointless,"OK, but feels too much like a ""day in the life of ... "" Not Lee's best work.

Here's my breakdown:

STORY: This reminds me somewhat of the the film ""Barbershop"" (2002), but the latter is a far better story (and film).

The chief problem here is that while there's obvious intent to stir conversation ... it just doesn't work.

I grew up during the Civil Rights movement, went to an inner-city black school, ad nausea ... so I get it, but this doesn't do justice to that, and it isn't entertaining either. This is / was not fleshed out well for an audience.

Last, as much as Lee may have tried (or not), there's no character development here. It's all just types.

ACTING: The acting was / is acceptable, but just fades away in the stereotypes of race and sub-cultures. No actor's skill stands out in anyway. Everyone just fades into the background, occasionally moving to the fore.

ENTERTAINMENT: Low -> average value

TEMPO: It moves, but its more circular without development

CINEMATOGRAPHY: Not much here

DIRECTING / WRITING: Director: I know Lee likes to write and direct, and act ... but this is a good example of why directors shouldn't direct their own writing, or worse --- act in the film too! Far, far better films he's directed are: ""Inside Man"" (2006) and ""Oldboy"" (2013), though the latter is very difficult to watch.

Writers: Do the right thing and don't direct your own writing. Just don't do it.

Is it a good film? So many better films in the ""Black"" category

Should you watch this once? Maybe

"Spike Lee's epic film, which blew me away","After having seen and really liking SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT (1986), I can recall eagerly anticipating DO THE RIGHT THING and seeing it the week it opened. I can also recall leaving the theater and feeling blown away (a similar feeling after seeing such gems as PULP FICTION, BLUE VELVET, and SOMETHING WILD). From the wonderful opening shots of Rosie Perez dancing to Public Enemy's raucous ""Fight the Power,"" I was instantly hooked. In fact, like his friend Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee is one of the best filmakers around in terms of music selection (something I realized again seeing SUMMER OF SAM).

Among the other highlights of DO THE RIGHT THING, which help to make it great:

1. Deeply moving performances by Rubie Dee as Mother Sister and and Ossie Davis as Da Mayor. 2. comical moments which are quite hysterical - Robin Harris's comedic riffs and friendly put-downs are extremely funny; Spike Lee also brilliantly deflates racial/ethnic stereotyping by showing how ludicrous and absurd is sounds as its being spouted, and gets us to laugh at it in the process. Seeing the rude sports car owner get his car drenched with hydrant water was a funny, satisfying moment. 3. Great direction and camera work, giving this the feel of an epic - despite the fact that it was set on a single city block. 4. Absolutely fine acting by the principles - Danny Aiello, John Turturro, Richard Edson, and Giancarlo Esposito were all superb. 5. Elements of great realism and topicality; e.g., the argument between Rosie Perez's Tina and her mom looked and felt like a real fight, ""Sal's Famous"" looked and felt like a real place, the mutual facial expressions of hostility between cops and neighborhood residents, etc. 6. An ending which continues to provoke debate. 7. The story line unfolding over the course of a singular day. 8. Nearly all the characters, including the minor ones, are well fleshed out and thus quite memorable.

Riot...,"Did Mookie 'Do The Right Thing' during the final confrontation? Maybe not... but, under the circumstances, who can blame him for his actions?

It's a blistering day in a black American community. You could fry an egg on the pavement. Our hero Mookie has a young child with possibly the loudest female in the world, so must take a job at the local pizzeria to make ends meet (and to preserve his hearing). The restaurant is run by a white Italian American family, which stands in stark contrast to the racial make-up of it's surroundings. Tensions start to stir when one of the customers notices there's no black faces in the eatery's American Hall Of Fame photo section, and when the owner refuses to redress the situation, the spark is lit on a simmering explosive. It all kicks off at closing time... And Mookie finds himself slap bang in the middle. At one point, he has a crucial decision to make. What will he do?

We home in directly into the lives of this diverse cast of people, young and old alike, during a sweltering 24 hour period in their small urban project. Most are just going about their business, and their everyday conversations and routines are surprisingly interesting to behold There is a rich vein of humour here, and a real sense of life in motion. All are dragged into the central conflict as the film goes on, whether they like it or not. Things will never be the same again... but could things have been handled differently? Of course, but when things escalate to this extent, all common sense goes out of the window. (this last sentence is especially prophetic...).

Definitely not just a film for a minority audiences, it raises a lot of questions it doesn't provides answers to... but this is a GOOD thing. After all, how are you supposed to learn anything if you don't talk about it afterwards? 7/10",7.0,30 July 2014

he does but doesn't,"do the right thing is about a neighborhood of real people. Everyone is this movie is a person and everyone is deeply flawed. You aren't supposed to find one person as being right or wrong. Race Relations can't be simplified as black and white. I don't understand how you can think that Lee thought the destruction of the pizza place because there were no pictures of black people on the wall was justified when he shows a Martin Luther King quote at the end about the pointlessness of racial violence.

If anything Lee points the finger on black communities themselves (even with the title do the right thing). The right thing of course is not to cause trouble get killed, or burn down businesses. The right thing is to grow up and take responsibility for your life. Which Mookie does not do. He doesn't throw the can through the store because he thinks Sal and sons are racist. He throws the can through the window because he realizes that Sal and his sons are in trouble, and instead of being a man and trying to calm down the crowd like da mayor does the easiest way to save them is to turn the violence towards the store.

Lee does a great job of showing how racial tensions can explode into violence when an African American character (Buggin out""), who appears to be socially conscious of the neighborhood and its makeup questions Sal about all the photographs of Italian Americans on the wall of his pizzeria.

The point is made by ""Buggin"" that most of Sal's customers who provide Sal with income, are African American and that Sal should display photos of prominent African Americans on the wall of his pizzeria. Sal, not surprisingly voices his position that he will display whatever photos he chooses because it is his establishment. From that point, the movie shows stereotypes of the various racial makeups of the neighbor and New York City generally. There is a scene in the movie where racial slurs are spoken by various characters right into the camera that is both funny and highlight the biases that each race has and how they see other ethnic cultures. I thought this movie did an excellent job of showing how racial biases can escalate into a riot and a tragedy because the people in the neighborhood did not approach the situation in a calm and reasonable way and instead, let their biases and anger control their thinking and conduct.",,1 May 2021
Do the Right Thing - My Review,"I'm not sure what to make of this movie.

For some reason I wasn't drawn to it, probably because I couldn't really understand what was going on. It had some interesting effects, like the constant red light that you see throughout the film no matter the time of day (excluding the riot scene), and the racial tensions throughout the film were vulgar yet realistic all the same; but I couldn't quite wrap my head around it completely. I felt like I was watching a film that was outside my realm, probably because I could not understand the world in which these people live in. The characters felt like stereotypes at times, which was probably intentional but got irritating after awhile, but at the same time it was poignant in its delivery.

I gave it the rating because I understood the context of how it was made, so even if it wasn't my cup of tea I gave it a higher rating simply for that reason.",7.0,1 May 2015
Spike Lee's best film,"I have no doubt to say that Do The Right Thing is one of the bets films dealing with racism. I was turned on by the atmosphere of this film. It deals with racial tensions of all races in New york. I think that what Spike Lee was trying to prove is racism never ends in this society and there will always be bigotry, violence, bloodshed. and he proved his point there. All the performances was excellence. I almost cried when i saw this film. I especially loved the music. It was like a ""feel-good"" music. It was done by Spike's father Bill. If you haven't got a chance to see it, then do so. 10 out of 10.",10.0,1 August 2000
Do the Right Thing,"Whilst there can be no doubt of the potency of the theme here, I thought the nature of the story telling was all over the place and angry. With temperatures rising, literally and metaphorically, the bored youth of an area of Brooklyn are becoming more and more frustrated. The thrust of these frustrations is epitomised by a battle of wills between Italian American pizzeria owner ""Sal"" (Danny Aiello) and his growing number of African American clientele. His walls are covered with famous faces - Al Pacino, Frank Sinatra, etc. From his heritage but his new customers feel that they are under represented. ""Sal"" isn't about to be bullied into anything, and to be fair to Spike Lee he does cleverly use this slow burning fuse to illustrate an whole slew of racial attitudes amongst a diverse community where change was coming - like it or not. As the heat shows no sign of abating, tempers finally flare and a denouement results in quite some eye-opening tragedy that though effective, I found completely anachronistic. It's told very much from one perspective but not puritanically. I think that might actually exacerbate my dislike of the proceedings because what appears to be happening to a decent and hard working American citizen is that he is being bullied, coerced and ultimately violated because he won't abandon his own traditions in favour of someone else's. It's cunningly depicting a change of identity for this community in a survival of the fittest fashion that I found quite intimidating. This isn't really about the characters themselves, more about the politics of a situation that became more and toxic as people left their conciliation hat at the door of reason on their way in. The dialogue struggled to get past the fu section of the dictionary and that just compounded the sense that it was more of a not so subtle rant than a story of respect offering any decent form societal evolution and equality. Maybe Lee would do it differently now? As it is, it's raw - but not in a good way.",6.0,3 June 2024
unbelievable,"Few movies can even hope to offer what Spike Lee's contemporary masterpiece does for moviegoers. ""Do the Right Thing"" excels in every way a movie can; engaging story, great characters, a stellar cast with brilliant performances and beautiful cinematography. The DP Ernest Dickenson makes the heat of the summer sun come to life, and you can almost feel the rays beating down on you watch.

In a nut shell, DTRT tells the story of the hottest day of the year in downtown Brooklyn. As we meet the characters, the story unfolds and temperatures rise. Like most of Lee's movies, DTRT is socially concious, takling issues of racism, loyalty and responsibility. Lee also puts together a visual feast, incorporating some brilliant sequences and shots. Lee is definetley the most important director to emerge from the late eighties and early nineties, and continues to be one of the most consistently entertaining auteurs today. DTRT is a testement to his film-making abilities. 10/10.",10.0,16 September 2001

"ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS OF ALL TIME: AN AMAZING, UNFORGETTABLE, FILM EXPERIENCE!","Spike Lee's ""Do The Right Thing"" is not only the best movie that he has ever made, but it's also one of the best movies of all time. A modern masterpiece that gets better every time that you watch it. This film gets people thinking and it's guaranteed that once you are finished watching it (for the first time or for the 100th time), you will talk about it and form your own opinion on ""WHO DID THE RIGHT THING?"". Not many movies can have such an effect on people's thoughts of morality and the social issues of our modern society as this movie. Every performance was excellent. The direction was good (the movie knew where it was going and how it was going to get there). The viewer gets to know the characters very well. There's the italians who run the pizza shop: Sal and his 2 sons Pino, the racist one, and Vito, the non-racist one. The koreans across the street in the market who are irritated with the black clientelle and vise versa. The hispanics. The 3 black men under the umbrella down on the corner. Buggin' Out, the troublemaker who starts it all. Radio Raheem carrying his boom box all around the neighborhood playing the same song...""Fight The Power"". Smily, the retarded man, carrying around pictures of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. Da Mayor, the nighborhood drunk, Mr. Senor Love Daddy, the DJ at the neighborhood radio station ""WELOVE 108.FM"", and Mookie (played to perfection by Spike Lee), the pizza delivery boy who work's at ""Sal's Famous Pizzeria"" and is caught up in all of the daily events but is finally forced to choose sides due to racial tensions. Everyone hates everyone. I liked how Spike Lee showed racism from all sides instead of stereotyping the racism in favor of whites or blacks. The racism is spread out equally and you can clearly see and understand every character's point of view and the reasons for doing what they do. The question is....""Who Did The Right Thing""? The climax is amazingly realistic and utterly brilliant. Decide for yourself who did the right thing. The film's theme is both anti-racist and anti-violent. Spike Lee's greatest work! Another film that gets the anti-racist point across is ""American History X"", but is not as effective because it shows racism from only one side (the whites) and ""Do The Right Thing"" shows racism from all sides, even hatred towards the same race. Spike Lee made another film about the lives of people in a particular neighborhood in New York City....That film was called ""Summer Of Sam"" but it's stereotypical and boring... Nothing like this. ""Summer Of Sam"" gets a 1 out of 10 but ""Do The Right thing"" gets a 10 out of 10! Excellent! See it!",10.0,19 July 1999
An Explosive yet Entertaining Dissection of Race Relations,"I wrote this review in 1989, before IMDb existed. That's why I'm submitting it now, with updates to reflect recent news story that this film addressed.

Nearly two months after its release, and after reading numerous articles about it, I finally saw Do the Right Thing. It's a remarkably entertaining, enlightening, controversial, and well balanced view of race relations in an inner city neighborhood (Bed-Stuy). The story in brief: Sal (Danny Aiello) and his two sons (including John Turturro) operate a pizzeria in Bed-Stuy that caters to blacks and other ethnic minorities. Mookie, who delivers pizzas and is played by Spike Lee, is the only black employee in the store. There are numerous interesting side stories:  Mookie's relationship with his sister, his Hispanic girlfriend and their son.  The relationship between Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) and his attempt to win the affection of a neighborhood woman (Ruby Dee)  The interaction between Sal and his two sons. The characters are developed fully, and we see them at regular intervals throughout the film as the director builds our empathy for all of them, warts and all. These include the slick D.J., Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn), who is never seen without his ghetto-blaster (A large, portable, radio cassette player, measuring about 1.5 m wide & 1.0 m high. It's played especially outdoors, in public places at loud volume; & carried on one shoulder with loudspeakers facing the head; since replaced by today's mobile devices), and Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito), an outspoken person in the community.

The movie's strength comes from its acting, realism, and how it challenges us to re-examine our attitudes on race relations. This movie could serve as an excellent vehicle for schools and community groups to discuss race relations and defuse violence.

Here are some discussion questions:  Was it reasonable for Buggin' Out, one of the more activist blacks in the film, to insist that Sal put the pictures of some ""brothers"" on the walls of his pizzeria?  Were the police accurately portrayed as all-white, bigoted and insensitive to the needs of the community? Or were they stereotyped? (This film predated the ""stop & frisk"" and ""police brutality"" charges that would emerge decades later.)  Were African-Americans shown to be unusually belligerent to the only two whites we meet outside the pizzeria, the Yuppie owner of brownstone, and 50-ish owner of an antique car?

Concerning the series of events that led to the riot at the end,  Was the riot caused by Radio Raheem's defiance in Sal's pizzeria, first by entering a closed shop, and then by blasting his radio inside, knowing how offensive Sal would find it?  Was Sal's destruction of the radio justified on the grounds that he was provoked beyond the breaking point?  When the fight between Raheem and Sal broke out, should Mookie, who was close to both of them, have interceded?  Should the group of local blacks have stopped the fight, since both Sal and Raheem were liked by both?  During the fight, was it realistic that no weapons were produced?  When the police arrived, did they use unreasonable force to restrain Raheem, or were they misled by his size and strength from realizing that they were choking him to death? (This film was decades before the Eric Garner case that presented very similar circumstances.)  After Raheem's death, which was not Sal's fault, was Mookie justified in breaking Sal's window? Was the looting of Sal's pizzeria understandable, if not forgivable?  Was the ending regarding Mookie and Sal believable?  Should there have been coverage of black prejudice against other groups to parallel the bias shown by Sal's sons toward blacks?

Considering all possible biases that could have been shown, the movie is reasonably well-balanced to show them all. There are some especially meaningful dialogues about racial attitudes: Between Sal and his bigoted son, between Sal and Mookie, between Mookie and the son, and between the white police officers and Sal. Each tests our deepest beliefs about race relations, and there is a fair balance between moderate and extreme views.

Movies exploring this important topic have become scarce in recent years. One notable exception was Crash, which won the Best Picture Oscar in 2005.

Do the Right Thing has excellent camera work, direction, pacing, characterization, music and authenticity. Not quite a masterpiece, but it is so rich, daring and unusual, that it's a must-see for those interested in the inner city of today. See it, enjoy it, and most importantly, discuss it with friends and those on both sides of the issues!",10.0,14 May 2016
My First Spike Lee Film,,,6 May 2011
Whats the right thing?,"As a little girl I remember watching the show GhostWriter and hearing mention of a Spike Lee contest, which lead me to watch Do The Right Thing, at the time I wasn't all that impressed, in fact if I remember correctly I was a little upset with Mookies character. Having watched the film again, I cant understand why anyone would recommend this movie to a childbut I will get into that later. The film is very representative of the time in my opinion, the dancing, the music, the clothes. The music really added to the film i must point that out, songs with lyrics telling to fight the power. I like how throughout almost the entire movie its got this hand-held camera kind of feel, the way the movie is shot makes you really feel as if you are right there on the street with the movies characters. There are also some very interesting camera shots in this movie. For example the scene where Radio Raheem goes into Sal's. We as the viewer see a point of view shot from Sal of Raheem, but this shot also painted Raheem in a more intimidating light,at least to me. I didn't care for the ending of the movie, I found it somewhat unrealistic. To think that someone starts the destruction of your business, and the next day you can friendly with them, just doesn't seem to realistic to me. I normally don't like movies that take place over a course of a day such a short time period, but in this particular movie it helped to hold my attention. Obviously the social message of the film is to do the right thing, but what is the right thing? I liked how it seems like the decision of what the right thing was, was left up to the viewer. I think that open interpretation is what Spike Lee was going for. I also find it very neat that Spike Lee wrote, directed and starred in it. It was also fun to see a younger Martin Lawrence and Samuel L Jackson. Overall I think it's a classic cultural movie that everyone should see, but its nothing special if that makes any sense.",6.0,17 December 2010
Political cinema,"""My job is to put the spotlight on race relations in this country"" says director Spike Lee, referring to his film Do the right thing.

Do the right thing is political film which does not force a view on the responder, however, represents different characters from diverse races who are all ""acting according to their own version of the right thing"" The film is loosely based on 'the Howard Bech incident of 1986' which sparked growing racial tensions in New York. Spike Lee certainly does not overestimate the power of film saying ""no films going to change things overnight"" however he uses various film techniques, (mise en scene) clever cinematography, and amazingly convincing performances of the American under class as a vehicle to bring into focus very serious racial and economic issues.

The Hollywood film delivers a disturbing political message, and is an Obvious ""wake up call"" to society. This is ironically obvious when the Film opens: the radio presenter Senor Love daddy is urging his listens To ""wake up""

The first time I saw the film I didn't think it was great, The deeper you look into it the more u will find, and for the Cinematography alone its worth watching.",9.0,4 April 2007
Can't we all just get along?,"Spike Lee doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the message of this film. Stress caused by prejudice erupts into a fantastic mess. Each character in the film brings in subtle yet powerful elements all leading up tho the climax. Like a bunch of neurotransmitters collecting and sending a strong signal to the brain. Race is not something Lee is afraid to confront. As a leading black film maker perhaps he feels obligated to make the film that so many others dare not to touch. The story really makes you think and question some of the ideals of the world. Like what is right and what is wrong and what makes something right even if it seems wrong. The message in the end is clear, that we all need to tolerate and respect each other. Everything else is counterproductive and just sends the cycle of racism and prejudice back into motion.",7.0,7 May 2014
Do the Right Thing with this film.,"""Do the Right Thing"" is a masterpiece of filmmaking; like it or not this is a fact.

Don't cheapen the polls by not including it. Do the right thing, unlike the Academy, and put it in.",10.0,6 February 2001
Couldn't share the enthusiasm of that era,"I have a problem with spike lee. I think that sometimes he is to busy preaching and not making actual movie, that has a plot. His movie is still relevant for today, but something with the style and the way the movie builds itself got me confused. There a lot of elements and a lot of sayings, that just mix one with each other until the bottom line shows up.

It's a world of colors and no one knows whether two different colors and cultures can blend and get along. Well, we actually know that it is true; we all can get along, but some people with different type of character, Not color. Character, wants to ruin for the majority and this is the base of the film.

People are people, without inserting the matter of race. This movie is reflecting about several types of people, but in a black New York neighborhood. A pizza place of an American-Italian owner is the heart of the movie and inside this heart everyone come to eat or order pizza.

Lee is building up the tension between the characters and gives love for some and some are just there to ignite the fire. At the end he is splitting his point of view to the way Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Has viewed violence, but the road to those conclusions was sometimes frustrating and sometimes insightful.

There is a wide range of characters, from so many types. We can categorize them not just by color, but also age, temper, seriousness, simple, complicated and what not. All live in the same area and all want to live simple and good lives, but there is one main event that will ignite them all to the familiar ending, that will feel like it has happened last week.

A lot of criticism from Lee and a lot of frustration. He is not offering any easy solutions, but let us try to think and distil what we would go with for the next battle between races or just battle about different point of views from any kind. It is an important movie, but I was struggling to stay focused and think it missed a lot of targets, due to his rhythm and confused focus for a lot of issues and items.",7.0,13 June 2024

An encompassing treatise on racism - confront yourself and your culture,"An amazing, creative, thoughtful treatise on racism. It shows how the simmering undercurrent of anger against injustice and racism can be ignited by something so simple as an unintended slight, a lack of respect shown for a photo on the wall (or lack of). Then, at the end, it underlines that racism is an endemic disease of institutions and systems, symptomatic of an entrenched culture versus an emergent culture, rather than one on one relationships (except for stranger with stranger encounters).",10.0,5 January 2018
viewing both sides of the story,,,15 December 2010
Interesting look into our inner city society,"I enjoyed this film, Spike Lee does well at capturing the heat of bigotry amongst the various ethnicities that are in Brooklyn. The visuals are very pleasing, certain scenes that are filmed on the street and in the pizza shop give you a true feeling of actually being there. Also the sound in the movie does well to create a deeper sense of reality. The screeching tires, early hip hop music, and noises of the city all are masterfully edited into the film to enhance the verisimilitude. I think that social message being portrayed is very eye opening and does well to create a sense of awareness. The acting is also very good. You get to tag along side of the different characters and witness on a first hand experience what problems they face on a daily basis as far as racism goes. You get to see the hatred between the African American community and the Italians,which awakens you to social issues that currently plague our society. The movie also does a good job in pulling you into the storyline. You can easily be immersed in the storyline and follow the struggles of the different characters.",7.0,15 December 2010

Feels like a poor high school play or a Broadway musical wannabe,"*** Warning *** -- may contain some spoilers

Everybody's raving how this is one of the best movies ever made. It even a got clean, crisp 100% ripe vote on rottentmatoes.com. I was expecting to be simply blown away by this movie. Instead, and much to my chagrin, I was forced to watch this half-hearted high school play. Poor acting, patronizing script, uneventful, boring action that never leaves one and a half block of a boring neighborhood. How's this a good movie?

OK, I understand that the topic is a hot button -- racial unrest in one of the most racist countries in the world (or at least, in the country with one of the most overt racist history). But so what? It's not the premise that counts, it's the delivery. And this delivery sucks!

The characters in this movie were all poorly drawn out to look like cardboard cutouts. Too much stereotyping, no real character development. The movie is desperately trying to tug in on the cheap sentiment that is prevalent in today's general public.

This movie is a disgrace. It's about time someone finally makes a real, honest and serious movie about the racial unrest in the States. Something like ""Crash"", only a bit less disjointed.

Oh yeah, a piece of advice for Spike Lee -- it's not a good idea to cast all your buddies in the film. Next time, try auditioning for the roles, before you begin shooting the movie. The acting in this movie was just terrible.

Still hot.,"One of Spike Lee's most revered outings, the 80s Classic 'Do The Right Thing'. I always thought it felt more 90s, but it was probably just ahead of its time or I was a few years late. Anyway enough of that, it's too hot for picky details. It's a scorcher y'see in Brooklyn. Sal (Danny Aiello) and his son Pino (John Turturro) own an Italian American pizza shop, have done for years (the ethnicity is important). The neighbourhood around them has changed though, now predominantly Black. It doesn't bother Sal, well not much. He's a proud man, hard working, happy with his place in the world. Pino though, like a lot of the cast is younger and more volatile. It might be a hot day, but this film is cool. Packed with a cast of cool characters. Realistic characters, serious, but fun, full of life. It feels like play, one carefully crafted set piece after another and it's bright! Loud and colourful, it really is a visual treat. Anyway back to Sal's. An unrecognisable Giancarlo Esposito, playing the brilliantly named Buggin' Out asks ""Why aren't there any brothers on the wall"" referencing Sal's photo collection 'Wall of Fame' featuring Italian Americans only. Mookie (Spike Lee), who works there smoothes things over after the inevitable argument, but it sets the tone. The whole thing is brilliantly soundtracked by a combination of DJ Samuel L Jackson broadcasting from the block and Radio Raheem a imposing lad who stalks the streets with the biggest boombox you've ever seen. Everything though has a sense of potential unrest. A fire hydrant fountain cooling kids off in the street, turns into an altercation with a very young looking Frank Vincent after getting his convertible soaked. There's jealousy over the successful Korean business on the corner and the volume of Kareem blasting out Public Enemy winding up those that aren't fans. They're undercurrents, signposting exactly where this is headed. This has to be one of the sweatiest films I can think of, the heat is rising and do the tensions. Everything works in harmony for a time, as long as everyone stays right where they are. It's a powder keg through, the smallest inconsequential events threatening to ignite the the fuse. That fuse is lit by the last person you'd expect, but the result is all too familiar. Riots and police brutality we've all sadly become so accustomed to. Friendships are abandoned in the heat of the moment and lives are destroyed. Lee paints a vivid picture, this put him on the map and although his subsequent films haven't always been great, when he hits the mark it's always worth a watch and over 3 decades on Do The Right Thing is more relevant than ever.",8.0,8 July 2020

Polarized much?,"This is a movie you have to watch just to see how you will react. You will see some pretty strong opinions both for and against it in this website's reviews. And I think that's the point of ""Do The Right Thing."" Not everyone will come to the same conclusion, but it's going to make you think. It will force you to try to decide where you stand and hopefully why you make your choice. It's something to discuss afterward, not just entertainment, even though I happen to really like the acting and dialog. There aren't many movies that put you through an experience like this one.

Looking first at ourselves,"I am a white male, raised in a Queens Italian neighborhood. growing up in the same era as Spike (late 60's, early 70's) back then NY neighborhoods were segregated. CORONA, NY was Separated geographically BY 3 distinct ethnic races, the Italians, the Hispanic, and the African/Americans (Louie Armstrong made his home about a mile and a half from mine,at one time, He hired my dad to work on that house .We did not mix, though, separated we were by invisible lines of race. This movie deals with that separation. The fact that it deals with a subject that was almost never talked about, makes it a most important movie, but add Spike's personal history (i shared similar experiences but on the other side of

cultural and financial fences) it becomes a honest movie, well done. a NEEDED movie, by a truthful, sincere director/writer. for me personally, it revealed prejudices ugly head, in a human way. It is my belief that we are all susceptible to it, and we need the Spike Lee's of the world if we truly wish to be better human beings.

maybe 8/10,"as i say i mite have given it another mark if but i feel it goes on for a bit too long and, mainly, Mr Lee's decision to cast himself in what one might consider the main role. His acting(especially when surrounded by Esposito, Davis etc) is sub-par and it turned a great movie into a good one. Like Tarantino after him, he seems to be a director who wants to make it as an actor as well. They are two talented writer/directors but not actors, i am sorry to say (at least QT designated smaller roles to himself by the way). All the other actors were fine,especially Tutturro, who shone, though that is praise to Lee's writing that he can create a character like that, one which seems to be full of hate but is not just ""the bad guy"". Apart from that i felt (as a white Englishman) it transposed me into that world very well with touches of humour, sentiment and tragedy.",7.0,5 September 2005
Spike Lee´s colorful masterpiece is truly one of the greatest American films ever!!!,"I am one of those people that think you should handle the important question about racism every day not just once a year(as in Sweden).This is Lee´s masterpiece, he is a good director even if the last years his films are not so good he has made some great films but nothing like this.

This film is excellent:the cinematography makes you feel like you were in the heat that day.Great music and fantastic acting by Spike Lee himself and other actors like Ossie Davis,Sam Jackson and Bill Nunn.You also see a little Martin Lawrence before he was famous in a very small role.This is really a film experiences to remember,I think I have seen it maybe three times.Another thing with it is the fantastic characters:Mookie,Radio Raheem Buggin' Out´.....

There´s only one thing I don´t understand:The main titles of the film.When Sexy dancers dancing to I think it is Public Enemy´s ""Fight the Power"".It looks silly but when you watch any music channel today you see new music videos that looks more silly.By far Spike Lee´s best joint and this is a very powerful and under appreciated masterpiece.The famous end is very frightening but still I like it very much.5/5",10.0,25 December 2001
It showed the wrong thing,"Do The Right Thing was a pretty good movie. It accurately portrayed the cultural diversity in Brooklyn and how a neighborhood, despite their differences and the ending, sticks together. It also captured how the police force in NY is stereotypically viewed when they use violence against civilians who struggle in a conflict: unchanged, regardless of the about 20-year gap from when the movie is set to now. The character I disliked but can understand is the guy that became angry and wished to start a boycott on Sal's Pizzeria. His anger comes from him thinking that Sal is racist but how can you sit and eat in the same pizzeria for 10 or more years and only get mad about something when you, for the first time, stop and look at your surroundings. Him being mad would've made more sense if he was showed to complain about the pictures whenever Sal was mentioned or went into/near the pizzeria.

"More Racist Garbage; the 8 is for Rosie, However.","""...who wonders why he has only pictures of famous Italian-Americans on the wall when most of his customers are black""

This is the typical garbage brought on by racist people when in someone else's establishment. How DARE the OWNERS put what THEY want on THEIR walls? The balls of them, right?

This movie depicts quite accurately the racial tensions, and this is exactly why. Stupid entitlement b.s. nonsense like this. Let's destroy a local business everyone's been enjoying because dark doesn't like what white has on HIS walls. Let's just make a federal case out of it, then blame it on everyone else but the one who starts the b.s. in the first place.

I grew up in this area, lucky Asian in the crossfire. I'm a minority too, but it's pretty easy to see who starts the garbage, then the same load cries when it is they who get punished for it. ""Everyone is out to get us!"" Psst: Stop causing a riot cuz someone doesn't have who YOU want on THEIR walls.

Again, movie is just another racist piece of trash. Surprise us, black directors. Stop whining about white people already. Slavery ended centuries ago. Holocaust was a little over 50yrs ago, don't hear the Jews nonstop whining over it.

"Do The Right Thing is a blistering, powerful, and mind blowing experience","Spike Lees Do The Right Thing is an absolute masterpiece. From a filmmaking and thematic standpoint, this is top tier stuff. From Ernest Dickersons dazzling cinematography and Wynn Thomas' smart production design/choices of color, to the towering performances and rich exploration of racial tension within a small Brooklyn community, this film fires on all cylinders, and leaves you speechless by the end. The film is set during the hottest day of the summer and tensions start to fly. The film is shot in a red/orange color palate and is a great way of conveying the theme of racial tension and anger. The heat is also a great example. The finale, is without a doubt the most powerful, angry, and towering experiences you will ever have watching a film. The searing performances, the rage that has built up, and the direction/photography all add up to one hell of a final act. I think If there's one problem with the film, it's that the acting isn't great. Don't get me wrong when it's good, it absolutely pierces right through you, but some of the performances, ESPECIALLY Spike Lees, are inconsistent and weak. Do The Right Thing is a masterclass. Everyone needs to see this film at least once in their lives. It's a must see.",9.0,9 December 2023
Do the Right Thing,"Do the Right Thing was the movie that put Spike Lee in the map. He got critical acclaim for this movie. Surprisingly many of the cast and crew were overlooked for award recognition.

Released at the tail end of the 1980s. It is an important film for black cinema as it allowed other black filmmakers to find a voice.

Set on a hot summer's day. One observer mentions the polar ice caps are melting. You just know that temperatures of the locals in Brooklyn will explode as the day goes on.

The location is Sal's Famous Pizzeria. Sal (Danny Aiello) built the restaurant and the business with his own hands. The black kids in the neighbourhood grew up eating his pizzas.

His eldest son Pino (John Turturro) is a hotheaded lazy racist. Always picking on his young brother Vito and delivery boy Mookie (Spike Lee.)

Trouble arises when rabble rouser Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito) notices that all the pictures in Sal's place are of Italian Americans. Robert de Niro, Frank Sinatra, Al Pacino etc. There are no black people even though blacks in the area are Sal's main customers. Buggin Out demands there are brothers in the wall and organises a boycott of the place.

He finds a sympathetic ear from Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn.) A big man who walks around with a ghetto blaster on loud playing songs from Public Enemy. Sal is annoyed with the music when he walks into his restaurant. So are other locals.

Radio Raheem gets involved in an argument with Sal and is later restrained by the police where he suffocates. The police actions result in a riot.

Spike Lee was inspired to make this movie by two quotes. One each from Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. The quotes appear at the end of the film and on face value appear to be contradictory.

It is not a film were characters are black and white. Sal tries to calm down Pino, but when the heat is own, Sal makes a racial slur. Mookie throws a bin through the pizza's shop window.

The Korean shopkeepers are viewed with suspicion. They have established a successful business and taking money from the black community. When the riot occurs the Koreans plead that they too are a minority to try to stop their shop getting destroyed.

There is an intense energy in this movie. Right from Rosie Perez's dance sequence in the titles. There is a lot of humour. Spike Lee raised issues that have reared its head many years after its release. Police brutality, the lack of black businesses in urban areas. Although Lee failed to spot the gentrification of Brooklyn which started to happen in the 1990s.

If there is a weak link. It is Spike Lee himself. He is just not a strong enough actor. I think he also had problems closing the film satisfactorily.",9.0,23 December 2023
Review of Do the Right Thing,,9.0,9 December 2010
Spike Lee's 'Do the Right Thing': A Bold 8/10 Masterpiece,"""Do the Right Thing"" is a cinematic rollercoaster that effortlessly blends gritty realism with a touch of rebellious spirit. Spike Lee's directorial genius is on full display as he crafts a narrative set against the scorching backdrop of a Brooklyn summer. The characters, pulsating with raw energy, bring the neighborhood to life in a way that feels both authentic and relatable. The film's stellar ensemble cast, including Lee himself, delivers performances that hit you in the gut, making the socio-political commentary even more poignant.

The film's pulsating soundtrack, dominated by Public Enemy's iconic ""Fight the Power,"" perfectly complements the narrative's urgency and defiance. The cinematography is a visual feast, capturing the vibrancy of the neighborhood while also conveying the simmering tension that eventually erupts. Lee's bold decision to avoid a simplistic resolution challenges viewers to confront the complexities of racial dynamics, leaving a lingering impact that transcends the screen.

While ""Do the Right Thing"" earns a solid 8/10 for its bold storytelling and groundbreaking approach, it may not be everyone's cup of tea due to its unapologetic examination of racial tensions. Yet, for those willing to embrace its raw power and thought-provoking narrative, this film is a timeless masterpiece that continues to resonate, urging us to reflect on the societal issues that persist today.",8.0,10 January 2024
thoughtful message,,,11 May 2010
striking but ambivalent,"For all its faults the breakthrough film by Spike Lee still likely provides more food for thought than all the summer blockbusters of any year, combined: love it or hate it, you won't be able to ignore it. Lee is not a polite filmmaker, and his heavily stylized kaleidoscope of urban racial tension is fast, colorful, and angry, touching on some very real issues in a very unreal fashion. At times he seems to be sending a mixed message, as indicated by the contradictory epigrams quoting Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, and underneath all the distracting, Scorsese influenced visual camouflage his characters are likewise (believably) confusing and unpredictable. Lee dwells more on the consequences than the causes of the climactic riot, suggesting it was triggered in part by local businessman Danny Aiello's insensitivity to the changing face (from Italian to Black) of his Brooklyn neighborhood, without ever explaining how a corner pizzeria could pose such a threat to Black American culture. But if the film is more successful as an exercise in style it nevertheless heralds the arrival of a celebrity director who, thankfully, doesn't shy away from controversy or confrontation.",6.0,14 November 2010
Do the Right Thing,"Do the Right Things is a movie that I would watch many times over. It brings race, mob mentality and drama all rolled into one film. Themes and issues include race, and violence. There are two different mentalities of the mob in this film one is that of Malcolm X that violence is not violence if it is self-defense, and the other reflects that of Martin Luther King Jr. that violence is never the answer. The title of the movie for me comes from one part in the film before the riot happens in which Mookie throws a trash can through the window. The question arises did he do the right thing by starting the riot that led to a mob be hosed down by the fire department. I felt as though each scene had significance, and I felt that I needed to watch each scene very intently. The director did and amazing job on this film Spike Lee; he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this film.

"Excellent commentary on American social politics, without being preachy","I watched Do the Right Thing in my high school film studies class, and it was my first Spike Lee film. (I hope to watch more). Although the film seemed to be structured more like a play than a traditional movie, it nevertheless managed to balance many characters and make several points about race without seeming preachy. The best part of about Do the Right Thing is that it manages to point out the problems about racism without making the issue seem simplistic. One of the best choices Spike Lee made was to give Do the Right Thing comedic elements, a style subsequently used by a more recent film about racial tensions in America, Dear White People. The comedic scenes are born out of serious societal discussions, and they both bring the issues to attention while at the same time highlighting how ridiculous racial divisions really are. Characters form the backbone of Do the Right Thing. There are many of them in the space of a single block (hence the ""play-like"" feel), and they each get enough screen time to make the vibe of the neighborhood believable. Some are more memorable than others, and they all are connected in one way or another to the main character Mookie (Spike Lee) and his boss, Sal (Danny Aiello). Although the other performances are strong, it is these two characters who elevate the movie. Mookie and Sal are written and played so that they are completely believable as human beings. Too many movies promoting discussion on race, sexism, and/or homophobia tend to present their characters as either the ""oppressed"" or ""oppressor,"" or they are halfhearted in their attempt to create grey area. Spike Lee does neither of these things, instead showing how ordinary people are affected by racism in this country through small incidents in the movie. The main thing the film accomplishes is that it explains how major incidents over race are rarely as spontaneous as the may seem, and that they are often the culmination of thousands of little tensions that reach a boiling point. Given the current political climate, Do the Right Thing is just as relevant today as it was in 1989.",6.0,24 May 2018

How To Do the Right Thing with Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing,,9.0,5 December 2023
My review,,8.0,6 December 2023
Boiling Racial Tensisons,"""Do the Right Thing"" is a drama written, directed, and even stared in by Spike Lee. It was one of Spike Lee's earliest works and believed by many to be one of his best. This film put him on the map, and kudos to him for taking on such a tough subject so directly early in his career. ""Do the Right Thing"" is a great highlight of racial tensions, discrimination, and ultimately unfortunate police brutality. While these issues highlighted the era of this film, they are still unfortunately quite prevalent in society today.

The film is set on a really hot day in Brooklyn, New York. The film is about the diverse and vibrant residents of the neighborhood including Mookie, played by Spike Lee himself. Mookie works as a pizza delivery guy for Sal's Pizzeria. Sal, played by Danny Aiello, and Mookie have a friendly, but underlying strained relationship. As the heat rises throughout the day so do the racial tensions. Some of this is brought on by one of Sal's sons Pino, played by John Turturro, who openly talks about his distain for black people. This leads to some confrontations. As the day goes on, tensions continue to rise eventually leading to police intervention, an unfortunate event and rioting in the neighborhood. The film is a great example of the turbulent times of the era when it comes to racism and discrimination.

This is a raw, truthful portrayal of racial tensions in America. I also think the camera work was quite good. They did a great job helping the audience capture the heat and I especially enjoyed the use of light in the shoot. I also enjoyed the music throughout the film which really added to the overall work.

Not a lot bad to say about the film. Perhaps one might say the ending was a little ambiguous, but I think that was on purpose as Spike was trying to display the many ongoing issues there still are in America regarding racism these days. How right he was.

Overall, this is a great, powerful film that has really held up over the years. It was quite similar to ""The Great Dictator"" as it looks at such important issues such as discrimination in a very direct way. The issues in ""Do the Right Thing' are still quite relevant and Spike Lee was awesome. Both as an actor and director, he took fearless approach to looking at such a difficult issue.",8.0,29 September 2023
Creative Film,"Spike Lee's film do the right thing reflected Lee's style. He is not only the director and writer but he also plays the star lead. The way the film is set up is to be both serious and funny. I enjoy how well developed the actors were. Each actor had different trails to them that made them unique. Most of them looked goofy. But their energy really brings the movie to light. The film is packed with great actors. I enjoyed the set and costume design. The film was real color-full. Buggin outs name really fits him well. I liked how the named of some of the character describes them I thought that was real creative. Such as Radio Raheem and MotherSiste. The film deals primarily with issues of race. Racism against black, whites, Chinese, and Puerto Ricans. You can tell that different characters are struggling with this issue. I believe the films not only deals with race issues but a lot of miscommunication. Buggin out thought brother should be on the wall because that is Sal primary customer base. Buggin out doesn't get that Sal wont put brothers on the wall because this is not his place. Sal's wall of fame consists of heroes in his heritage. He even tells Buggin out that if it was his place he could do what he wants. Buggin out takes it as Sal is ungrateful for the community that makes his pizza place run. Also in the scene towards the end sees Radio Raheem radio as a material object. But to Raheem it is a part of his identify. When Sal smashes the radio, because of the noise, Raheem takes it a Sal smashing a piece of him. This causes the situation to esulates into a riot.",,25 April 2010

Not Surprised at the Responses,"I can't add much to the long list of reviews for this film. Because I am white middle class and because I often found Spike Lee abrasive, I have never seen the film. I'm really glad I did because no matter what your take, you can't help but weigh in on it. And I think that's the point. The issues of racism and poverty are way too complex to begin to present in a film. The director creates a group of interesting characters, appropriate to the setting (an extremely hot day in Bedford-Stuyvesant) and then simply takes a step back and watches what happens. I didn't feel hatred toward anyone (except maybe some of the cops) because most days there is a symbiosis (harsh as it may be) that allows them to get from one day to the next. People complain about the language, but it has to be there to recreate the hopelessness of this place. Excellent acting and a real groundbreaking film.",10.0,12 October 2022

The reasons why I do like this movie. One:Radio raheem: The part when he was explaining love vs hate. It had really touched my heart it made me look at it a different way. Two:Spike Lee had really caught the racial tension in Brooklyn, New York.

Overall I think all HS students should see this movie to understand life in NYC.",6.0,21 April 2015

Spike Lee's Finest Joint,"Spike lee is one of the most controversial filmmakers of our time. His experience as a teenager growing up in New York city is a sign of where he found his racial sensibilities and used these to his advantage in his visionary work. Do the right thing creates an incredible atmosphere,its we can almost smell the pizza from Sal's pizzeria. Do the right thing opens cleverly with the aggressive public enemy song ""FIGHT THE POWER"" with a powerful choreographed dance from Tina Perez, that almost pushes us on to the streets of Bedford-Stuyvesant where right from the beginning there is an explosion of energy. This exciting energy is consistent throughout the whole film, humor and moments of contemplation in the carefully scripted plot is made more exceptional by the vibrant reds and obscure angles that truly captures that hot summers day in hells kitchen like no other film.

Do The Right Thing directed by Spike Lee is one of the most influential films in cinema. A story built around hate, love and well, doing the right thing. This is a film that shows it's audience the story of a neighborhood in Brooklyn. A movie about racial inequality on the hottest day of the summer. Spike Lee preaches his audience to Do The Right Thing throughout the film. The story offers a gritty, raw and realistic view of racial inequality.

really good,"I never really paid Spike Lee a lot of attention. His films just always seemed a bit over the top. This film is over the top at times. It works. It works really well. This is one of his earlier efforts though so he's probably just trying to recapture the feeling of this film and its just been coming off as forced. Everything just clicks in this film. Its funny as hell in the beginning, then it starts getting a little message-y and then BAM! The ending is so jarring that it feels like you just took a boot to the face. The film builds perfectly to it. This slow burning intensity that has been building throughout and then it just finally explodes. The acting is great, Turturro I think really steals the show though as the racist son of Danny Aiellos pizza shop owner. Danny Aiello does a solid job as well, as does Spike Lee as Mooky the pizza delivery guy who's just trying to live his life the best he can. The soundtrack is amazing. They use Public Enemy's Fight the Power a little too much but it serves a purpose. There is so much going on in this film. Its never dull, it doesn't slow down. Great movie",,11 December 2010

What is right,,9.0,9 December 2010
"A bold statement on racism and the conflict between Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Essence-wise, surpasses Robert Wise's ""West Side Story.""","Do The Right Thing (1989) : Brief Review -

A bold statement on racism and the conflict between Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Essence-wise, surpasses Robert Wise's ""West Side Story."" The film ends with two text quotes: One is of Malcolm X, in which he talks about killing someone in self-defense, and one is of Martin Luther King, which talks about how an eye for an eye makes everyone blind. Two different mindsets, but that's how society behaves. We meet both kinds of people in our lives who follow either ideology, and Do The Right Thing is about that conflict. Racism has been one of the major issues in America, and we have seen many movies exploring those factual errors of humanity. Here is one more, but this one's effective too. Set in a hot summer, the film explores a Brooklyn neighborhood's simmering racial tension between its African-American residents and the Italian-American owners of a local pizzeria. Even though those black people like the white man's pizzas, some of them are jealous. Those few jealous people cause a tragedy and violence that does not only destroy peace and lives but also leaves us with so many questions about dead humanity. The screenplay is pacy, and the use of rap and music gives it a modern touch. A lot of F words do feel irritating sometimes, but that shouldn't be a problem because this film is only for mature audiences. West Side Story dealt with a similar issue and also had a tragedy in the end, but that was a love story (based on Romeo & Juliet). Do The Right Thing is a powerful social drama with devastating visuals of human activities. The performances were impressive, and so was the camera work. Spike Lee did it again with his favorite theme, ""racism."" All black people and some white people in America must be grateful to him forever for his work. The money scene in the end is an ugly mirror of society. Don't miss.

Mookie, played by Spike Lee is a lazy young man who needs a good lesson in responsibility and the value of work, his girlfriend however isn't any better. The film is about the struggle to find work, keep work, and do work. Da Mayor and Mother Sister are my favorite characters in the film as they add some sturdiness and gravity to the situation. They are well developed characters who I both wish had had more screen time. The three losers, ML, Coconut Sid, and Sweet Willie were the black man version of Greek chorus and added some humor to the film. The material was very deep and much darker than it was portrayed.

A masterpiece.,"The only people I know who don't give this movie the highest regard are those who object to its politics. So I will leave that out here. Because, to be simple and clear: this is formally, artistically, cinematically a masterpiece.

The mix of naturalistic (realistic) filming with some steady inserts of artifice (non-realistic or staged sections) are smart and deliberate. This is a fable, in a way...it even has a narrator intone (in Jackson's usual somber humor) as if relating a great epic. There are moments of comic relief, as with the old folks in chairs on the sidewalk, and moments of visual strangeness (with inventive camerawork). All of this adds to the effect of making, with great precision, a movie of note.

There is also a handling of types (stereotypes) that echo reality (more types) so that we are given huge and difficult issues in ways that we can quickly manage. There are biases and negative preconceptions on both sides (from Black to Italian-American and back). There are human touches and then brash generalities. There are moments of meeting on common ground followed by moments of not seeing common ground right in front of everyone.

There is of course the content--the tragic lesson of people from cultures clinging to their cultures, and naturally so. But then of those same people not seeing the times changing, or not seeing the history of what came before. All of this cuts both ways. The fact is of course that Spike Lee is a Black filmmaker, and his leaning is to the injustice of the police, who are white, and by extension the blind racism of some of the pizza workers, who are Italian-American. The Black characters are flawed as much as the white ones are, though the climax of the film creates a crisis of morality for the viewer who brings their own history with them.

So, it's beautifully filmed (by Dickerson) and thoughtfully directed (by Lee). It has pathos, humor, and a great narrative arc with layers and love and violence. It tries to do it all and pretty much does it all. Well done. I've been teaching film history for years, and this one always opens eyes and gets a great dialog going. Terrific stuff.",10.0,15 January 2024

Giancarlo Esposito as the flaky Buggin Out was utterly uproarious and Danny Aiello was the very endearing Italian pizza chef Sal who scrabbled not to give in to his eldest son, played by a young and talented John Turturro.

If you do, you will get something bad in your life. Furthermore, if we consider the sound of the movie, this movie is dominant because there are many sounds in the movie. In the dancing scene in the beginning, the sound of music is off-screen sound(nondiagetic) because the dancing has the same pattern with the song. In addition, there are many off-screen sounds that are from the radio in many scenes. Besides, for nondiagetic sound, there are two types; first, the director uses instrument to make the sound background such as Jazz; second, the director uses music that has the singing to be the sound background. In the scene of the argument, the quantity of sound are high pitch, high frequency, and very high loudness.

Before She Hate Me Spike had something to say,"I wasn't going to comment but after reading some of the debate over who ""did the right thing"" in the movie had me laughing. There are neighborhoods like Bed-Stuy all over the country and I grew up in one similar to the one in the movie. Usually a neighborhood will have stores that represent the demographics of the population. What Spike Lee is saying in certain neighborhoods are about money and gentrification. An Italian and Korean store in a black and Latino neighborhood was a crucial plot point in the film because the attitudes combined with the humidity led to the movie's climax. I saw this when i was 13 years old and got the message instantly. I've never questioned Mookie's action of whether he ""did the right thing,"" because I understood the monologue Radio Raheem gave earlier in the movie. The love/hate war Radio Raheem talked about was to me at 13, very clear, because just when you think hate wins, love subsides and overcomes. Right before Mookie threw the trash can threw Sal's window he yells ""hate!"" SPOILER-when he goes to Sal about getting paid finally at the end, they both cautiously become friends again (love). Radio Raheem wasn't a thug, he was just a normal guy in the neighborhood who had the respect for being older and yes, even more mature than the other people on the block. Spike Lee wasn't condemning anyone in this movie but examining norms affecting society in neighborhoods like Bed-Stuy, when combined with heat and the attitudes of a few trouble makers explode. When Sal's burned down, Spike left a hidden message there, do you think Sal rebuilt his place back to Bed-Stuy?? Of course not, but now the property is vacant and open to someone else at a low price for redevelopment (gentrification).

You want a movie about race? Watch this and forget 'Crash' and 'The Help',"Spike Lee gets a bad rap. Why? Because he's a black guy that can think critically. Therefore he pisses many people off, black and white. Usually that makes for some good art, this film is no exception.

Watch this movie if you want to watch a film that deals with 'deep meaning of racial issues.' Movies like ""Crash"" and ""The Help"" are disneyfied ignorant simplistic garbage. Watch some of Spike Lee's other films from this period too. This guy has it, white people that make Hollywood movies like ""Crash"" and ""The Help"" don't. Yes, you do actually have to be from the group that has been denigrated to describe that experience in an art form.

He doesn't brow beat you with ""racism is bad"" or ""white people are evil"" messages. He's just a good director, writer, thinker and storyteller that doesn't dumb anything down. Most, if not all, movies coming out of Hollywood that are trite garbage.",9.0,18 August 2011
Do the Right Thing,"This emotionally and intellectually powerful film discusses many race issues facing America. Although it is focused on serious subject matter, there are also many comedic aspects to the movie. The interesting characters and stylistic proponents make this film more intriguing to watch. The music selection also adds to the scenes and the expected emotions. I enjoyed how it was based around the hottest day of summer on a city block in Brooklyn. This small scenario leads to a large climax and major events. Lee effectively blends sensitive racial issues and drama with comedy to create an interesting and enjoyable film to watch.",6.0,31 March 2005

Incredible movie and time piece,"This is a classic, a movie which does everything, provide a great sense of a period in America, and provide a balanced perspective upon a difficult issue. Whatever Spike Lee's personal views, he does a wonderful job of providing real life characters on both sides of a racial debate.

You are there in the midst of a confrontation in a racially mixed area of Brooklyn, and see a rapidly-arising conflict from various perspectives.

What a great movie is. Well-written, true to life, realistic, the adjectives flow.",10.0,21 October 2013
Do The Right Thing,"Do The Right Thing is a 1989 film written and directed by Spike Lee. Let me just cut into it, the film depicts race relations like no other film, it isn't over the top racism, or the white savior complex, it's real. This film is a low budget independent film, as Spike Lee made the most out of it. The film is directed in a very unqiue way, with odd angles, close zoom in, an quick jumps of dialogue. The set is stylish and so are the costumes. The performances while some are one dimensional, still hold up, like the performances by Ossie Davis, Danny Aileo, and Spike Lee himself. This film is written with powerful dialogue and a great soundtrack as well. Essentially, this film is about the constant battle of love vs. hate. This film is about the clashing perspectives of that battle, and how it is impossible to ""Do The Right Thing"" in a system that's broken. This film has no resolution of an ending. Just angry, bitter, and ignorant people. Except for da mayor. This film is about how bigotry and hate is alive very much, and how little things can set it off, turning into bigger things that shouldnt happend. This film is about the reactions of the oppressed and the poweful in a flawed system. This film is about whether or not violence is the answer. All peace is an impossible virtue, yet violence and hate is a never ending wheel of recycled unresoltion. This film couldn't be more relevant to the current climate of the world today. Do The Right Thing is a cinematic landmark.",8.0,9 June 2020

"My review of Spike Lee's, ""Do The Right Thing"", after viewing for the first time",,8.0,1 October 2012
Race relations movie is important though flawed.,"Spike Lee has shown his ability to produce and important film. The recent Blakkklansman (Rating EIGHT) is an important film and warrants watching. This movie could be unfavourably be compared with the superior Boyz n the Hood (1991) but it predates that movie by two years and it was broader in that it showed the race relations more starkly than any other movie was attempting at the time rather than (just) exploring Black culture in a specific location. I would happily say the Spike Lee was still finding his feet in directing this movie. Perhaps leaning on his music video work the opening credits passage is excellent. Rosie Perez is dancing ferociously to ""Fight The Power"" and is powerful and absolutely representative of the times. Thereafter and particularly in the first half the movie feels like a play that is being filmed. It feels very staged and uses a lot of young talent that is early on its learning curve resulting in some inconsistent acting. I'd argue there was a change of camera policy too. The colour palettes are strange and the shots confined so some of the scenes look like they're being performed on a set rather than an actual location in Brooklyn. You'll be convinced of this until an hour in there's a fabulous tracking shot of Spike Lee's character passing by all these places we have visited in the first half. Very odd. The characters are too stereotyped and there's masses of gesticulation. To be fair(?) no community escapes this. The Asian, Latin, African-American and Italian-American are all a sea of what appears (twenty years on) to be ignorance. Strangely if we're going to look at things with hindsight the female characters are the ones that are the best written and most credible. The film seems to lack focus and though it has idea about its end goal, it doesn't have much of an idea how to get there. In this respect it mirrors Spike Lee's character (Mookie) who incidentally is totally unbelievable. To conclude, Do the Right Thing is almost twenty years older than Blackkklanman and absolutely remains an important film. It's is flawed but it is humorous at times and though a touch monotonous, the soundtrack is welcome and energetic. The movie ends with a Martin Luther King quote which sheds more light on Spike Lee's motivation. How well he managed to realise this is up for debate. SIX",6.0,11 September 2019
A movie that had very high quality but with controversial ethical questions.,"This is a hard movie to review, and I need to put a few disclaimers here to avoid misinterpretations. I've seen other movies by Spike Lee and very much liked them........Jungle Fever, Malcolm X and School Daze. For some reason I never saw ""Do the Right Thing"" even though it was his most famous. Well, we went to see it this week at our local city art museum, which we are members of. A lady first gave her beliefs about the themes of the film, listing a series of attacks against Black people...the fact that one of them was the proved racist fraud of the Tawana Glenda Brawley fake rape case and the lady belonged to ""Black Lives Matter"" was a warning that this might be about race baiting. The movie is two extremes; on the one hand, it's an incredible masterpiece of directing, screen writing and acting, a nearly perfectly made film as far as filmmaking itself was concerned. On the other hand, it was a film that could be quite hypocritical film with some enabling of racist viewpoints and one or two approvals of violent solutions.

The climatic scene, a violent and terrible race riot, gave an eerie version of the Michael Brown event many years before it happened. A anti-violence quote by MLK came at the end, immediately followed by a pro-violence quote from Malcolm X, from when he was young and had views he later denounced. This was a truly controversial movie, with parts I loved and hated, but of highest quality. I have recently edited my original review, which had very negative comments, after reconsidering. I didn't like my review so redid it. One can only criticize so much to a masterpiece of film making.",8.0,1 September 2015
Riot,"In the movie, Do The Right Thing, there was a very great scene where three gentlemen walked into Sal's. The three African Americans went into Sal's place and started demanding that Sal put pictures of African American Heros, not just White Italians. This part of the move really expressed the differences between the people. The Italians suddenly weren't liked and the police. Then when the police officer choked to death, Radio Raheem, that's when everything just broke the barrier. After his death there was nothing else for the Black neighborhood, but the burn down Sal's Pizzeria. It symbolized how they felt, instead of hurting Sal and his sons, they just took it out on their place.Just goes to show that there is still tension from the days of discrimination in our country.",6.0,21 May 2006

Do the Right Thing,,9.0,9 December 2010
Spike Lee Does the Right Thing - Gives America a Much-Needed Shake-Up!,"Do the Right Thing is set on a single block in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a Brooklyn ghetto neighborhood, on a summer day so hot that the sun blisters your soul and the heat has a way of magnifying your irritability, of searing your heart – as we follow the on-goings of an multi-ethnic vicinity from a morning when interracial civility is already strained to a night when all hell breaks loose.

Lee establishes the neighborhood dynamic right at the outset. The focal point of the activity is Sal's Famous Pizzeria, operated by the Italian-American Sal and his two sons – Pino, an unrepentant bigot, and Vito, a kindhearted kid, in tow. Our central protagonist Mookie has a pure dead-end job - making deliveries for Sal's pizzeria. Sal enjoys his business, respects his black patrons as long as they play by the rules and treats Mookie with the same combination of amused tolerance and restrained sarcasm that Mookie uses with him. However, Sal keeps a baseball bat handy if anyone wants to argue. No one has yet. Today someone will. Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) is fed up with the photos of celebrated Italians, from Sinatra to Stallone that decorate Sal's 'Wall of Fame'. He and his pals wants to see some black celebrities or 'brothers' as he puts it on that wall. Sal refuses to give into their demand and soon tempers flare as Buggin Out attempts to start a boycott of Sal's. When Radio Raheem (played by the superb Bill Nunn) enters Sal's with his boom box blaring Public Enemy's rap anthem ""Fight the Power"", tempers are way past the flare point. Sal's bat smashes the radio that is Raheem's pride. A fight ensues and the police are called - white police! Raheem, choked by a cop's stick, falls. Raheem's senseless killing releases all of Mookie's pent-up frustration and he sends a garbage can crashing through Sal's window during a galvanizing moment, as all howling hell breaks loose!

Do the Right Thing is complex, bravura movie making, but is also hugely entertaining, since fortunately for us, Spike Lee's seditious method is to use humor to carry his biting message. The film's enormous amount of humor is satiric, physical, sometimes inside, sometimes throw-away, but pervasive. As temperature and tempers explode, Lee shoots his various characters through wide-angle lenses, their faces distorted to express how racism truly distorts the way you see others. While the characters are certainly etched in bold strokes, there are no heroes or villains here - there are fully fleshed characters with the complement of admirable and deplorable qualities. The exceptional work by all the actors helps keep the archetypes of ingrained bigotry from slipping into stereotypes.

All of this leads up to an exceptionally honest climax to an exceptional film, a movie that wisely deprives you of the cozy resolutions and epiphanies so often manufactured by Hollywood. Spike Lee offers no reassurance, no uplift, no call for all races to join hands and spout liberal platitudes. What he does offer is a devastating portrait of urban American life – the most vigorous shake-up you have had in years!",9.0,26 April 2015
Spike Lee & company do the right thing,"Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" is considered a modern classic by many. Set on the hottest day of the year in the Bed-Stuy neighbourhood of Brooklyn, the film follows several individuals throughout the day as racial tensions become increasingly strained. The story that unfolds ends up being both explosive and thought-provoking.

I'll begin by saying that the cast is nothing short of spectacular. Danny Aiello's strong performance was recognized with one of the film's two Oscar nominations but a load of other fine performances were overlooked. For starters, you've got John Turturro, Spike Lee, Giancarlo Esposito, Rosie Perez, Ossie Davis & Ruby Dee. When you consider some of the smaller roles you've got people like Samuel L. Jackson, John Savage, Frank Vincent & Bill Nunn. An enviable cast, to say the least.

Spike Lee's script resulted in the film's other Oscar nomination and, while that recognition was well deserved, I'm surprised that his direction didn't receive the same distinction. Even more shocking is the fact that Ernest Dickinson's vibrant cinematography wasn't nominated either. Musically, I didn't care much for Bill Lee's score but the soundtrack selections fared better, especially Public Enemy's classic ""Fight the Power"", which was used extensively.

Overall, ""Do the Right Thing"" delivers in all areas. The acting is first-rate, the visuals are attractive and the story packs a punch. I know that some might balk at watching a movie with a message (ambiguous though it may be) but this one is well worth the effort.",8.0,10 January 2011
movie review,"Do the Right Thing is a Spike Lee classic film. This movie was so artistically done from the extremely fascinating cinematography to the dramatic disturbances of racism and story. This movie is really interesting to try and analyze, primarily because were not sure exactly what message Spike Lee is trying to Convey. The movie being in a black neighborhood during the late 80's early 90's you'd think the movie would be all about black racism. However I found Spike Lee to be psychologically reversing it. Instead I as the audience, a white male, felt for the movie. I felt that Lee was conveying an over powering black world that is unwelcoming to any opposite races. Instead of blacks being discriminated against, whites and other ethnicities were. It was a total reverse effect. They wanted ""brothers"" on the wall in Sal's pizza joint, but didn't really approve of Sal and his Italian son's, because they weren't black. The emotion and anger I felt during the denouement of the movie was as if I was suffering from living in a racist community. This to me was so interesting to feel, the simple fact that black people were sort of the discriminators is such an interesting approach for a movie I thought it was great. I also loved the movie's cinematography. lot's of awesome angles and lot's of interesting subjective shots some that definitely broke the invisibility barrier.",8.0,4 May 2011
Do the Right Thing,"There was a lot of emotion in this movie. I don't think I would watch it again, because of all the negative energy and emotions. It was a very strong movie and you need to look past peoples actions to fully appreciate the movie, I think. I didn't have a problem with the cinematography or lighting, everything showed the moods perfectly. Near the end it was a lot more low key lighting especially outside with the fire scene. I thought the actors did a great job with their roles. I thought they played them up perfectly and really showed the true attitudes of the people who might have been in that situation. It was a good movie for the strong hearted. I would recommend it to certain people.",,19 December 2012
"Great Film, but Not Without its Flaws","This film tackles hard topics with a confidence almost unseen in cinematic history prior, headed by one of cinema's most talented directors, Spike Lee. Spike tells the story of a particularly hot dog day tearing a neighborhood apart and makes a film that, while surely a product of its time, is still very relevant today. My one criticism is that it doesn't quite say anything about the animosity, but rather takes an optic on it, not an inherent flaw, but not my type of film, personally. A must watch, but one I certainly don't likely see myself watching it again.",7.0,18 November 2021
Lee's Style is not for everyone but this film does many things right,"Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing(1989) announced the arrival of a new and provocative filmmaker to the American Cinema landscape. Spike Lee knew the ""rules"" of filmmaking but decided to break many of them. The avant garde style of Do The Right Thing and the occasional breaking of the 4th wall reveal's Lee's willingness to take chances in filmmaking and truly engage the audience in the film's message of the powder-keg that is race relations in the inner city. The performances of the film were highlighted by Ossie Davis' fabulous portrayal of Da Mayor in a role that provided laughs and heartbreak. There were no weak links in a cast that failed to capture true verisimilitude but captured the complex relationships and emotions of a neighborhood on the edge.",8.0,13 May 2011
A comedy with a very serious message,"Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing (1989), though now over 20 years old is still as completely socially relevant then as it is today. The movie unflinchingly depicts our society and its many ""racial societal divisions"", which when it was released made many people angry and uncomfortable (it still does today). Probably because there was some truth to it... The film itself has a range of excellent and developed characters, each with a distinct persona. What is also notable about this film is how excellently Lee builds the day up. The movie begins as a comedy, lulling the audience, and then when the movie peaks literal hell breaks loose, and the movie is suddenly incredibly serious. This makes Do the Right Thing accessible because it is able to reach a wider audience by combining both elements.",8.0,13 May 2011
Hypocritical Garbage,"Spike Lee's pathetic attempt to glorify hypocrasy and laziness and turn it into an issue of racism by ""the man"". In many ways this movie exposes the truth in it's hypocrasy. Lee didn't do his race any favors by making this waste of time.",1.0,4 July 2019
Avoids turning into a walking cliché or a heavy-handed lecture,"Racial relations in films leave much room for sugarcoating and biased views of one or more people on the cast and crew, but thankfully, Spike Lee is too smart to take sides or choose whose battle to support. In Do the Right Thing, he shows how racial relations have hurt one specific street block in Brooklyn. The result soars past any expectations one has going into it.

The film plays like an anthology, featuring people that resemble real people, and who pack in realistic flaws. It takes place on a brutally hot day in the neighborhood, with the temperature in the late nineties to early hundreds. The film's center is a pizzeria on the street, called Sal's Famous, which is run by an Italian father and his two sons. The father is Sal Frangione (Aiello) who has been on the block for over twenty years, and his sons Pino (Turturro) who refers to coming to work like ""Planet of the Apes,"" and Vito (Edson) who is accepting of the blacks.

They're the only white people we see throughout the whole film and yet, despite some of their comments, we can sympathize with them in a way. All they want to do is run a business, but odd complications plague their day. The only black character employed at the pizzeria is slacker Mookie (played by Spike Lee himself). Mookie is a gentle and sweet kid, but seems to develop a distracting fondness for anything but his work.

Other people around down are simple, frequently drunk ""Da Mayor"" (Davis), Mother Sister (Dee), who observes the neighborhood through her window, Radio Raheem (Nunn), who blasts his music at deafening level on his boombox, which annoys many, Buggin' Out (Esposito), a geeky man who wants to see some black people on the wall of Sal's Famous, and Sonny (Park), a Korean grocery store owner across the street from Sal.

Not a lot of films can perfect the idea of ""all characters, no plot,"" but Do the Right Thing is effortlessly convincing. The film also excels in being extremely original and stylistic in the sense that the heat from the day itself seems to be creeping out on screen. All the characters are soaked in sweat and the cinematography is so bright and loaded with primary colors that it comes off as infectious and unique. Even the air looks to be seamy and murky. Every detail is included, and nothing is overlooked.

Finally, there's the climax, one of the best, most involved I have yet to see. It's unexpected, well-choreographed, and never misses a beat. It doesn't seem cartoony, as much as it seems realistic and well done. I wish I could go into greater detail, but it needs to be seen to be believed. Also, one of the characters does an act you wouldn't think that insights one of the major plot points. I think it's safe to say, he didn't do the right thing.

Do the Right Thing isn't only provocative, but it avoids clichés and doesn't give us the same ""racism is bad"" lecture. It's too original and intelligent for that. Lee has introduced us to likable characters that we continue to adore as the film goes on, and despite the heavy climax, we still at least respect. You're left contemplating what the right thing is/was and how would you go about doing it.

"An Excellent,Powerful And Unforgettable Masterpiece From Spike Lee And One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made.","Do The Right Thing is an excellent,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece of cinema and one of the greatest films ever made that mixes amazing direction,a great cast,a fantastic script,an outstanding score and soundtrack and beautiful cinematography and is filmmaking and Spike Lee at their best.

Set in the neighborhood section of Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn,New York,Do The Right Thing tells the story of a local neighborhood and people that have to deal with racial tensions and hate on the hottest day of the Summer that explodes in violence and leads to tragedy,mayhem and chaos.

Released in the Summer of 1989,Do The Right Thing is the brilliant and powerful Masterpiece that introduced the world to director Spike Lee. Although Lee had made a splash with his first two great films the Romantic Comedy-Drama She's Gotta Have It and the funny College Comedy-Drama-Musical School Daze,Do The Right Thing in my opinion was his first real breakthrough and even though Spike Lee has made many great and truly wonderful films since none of his other films(with the exception of Lee's other Masterpiece Malcolm X) have left an amazing and powerful impression on viewers like Do The Right Thing had. Right from the opening credits Do The Right Thing pulls you into an amazing unforgettable cinematic experience that keeps you glued to the screen with great intensity and fiery. It's a movie that is very realistic and stylish,funny and tragic,thoughtful and observant,raw and in your face as well as movie that grabs you by the throat and never lets go until the very end. Also Do The Right Thing maybe one of the best and greatest if not the best and greatest film about race and racism in America and with DTRT Spike Lee gives viewers and examination of Racism why most human beings are Racist and Lee doesn't sugarcoat anything and just approaches the Racism with realism and no race or ethnicity in the film Blacks,Whites,Hispanics and Asians goes unscathed. Lee has talked about race in most of his other films and in his other films they were very thought-provoking but DTRT is his most powerful film about race. The talks of Race and Racism is powerful and frank and will leave an great impression on viewers because the themes of racism is timeless. Each of the main characters in the film are real and are very complex and multidimensional and aren't stereotypes but the kind characters that we see in real life and just like in real life there are flesh and true life characters in the film that are likable and unlikable but stay with you after the film is over. What I also love about the film is the fact that DTRT takes place over the course of one day and hot weather and temperature. I love films that take place in one day or in 24 hours and DTRT gives viewers a day in the life in a Brooklyn,New York section neighborhood showing the characters doing regular everyday things but it is slightly distorted with tension in the air and the Hot weather adds to the tension. The 100 plus degree Weather is an accurate representation of not only Heat but the tension among the film's main characters that is boiling and ready to explode like a bomb and it is not the sweat or the heat but with violence and harsh language and Spike Lee puts the high level tension to the forefront and brings it out and never lets up. The beautiful cinematography by Ernest Dickerson is amazing and stylish with Ernest Dickerson making the hot sunlight and heat look great to look at with close ups and weird,tilted angles with amazing visuals making the different colors and styles come off the screen. The screenplay by Spike Lee is very masterful and well-written with Lee giving the characters memorable dialog that is harsh and true to life and each of the main characters come to life thanks to Lee's great uncompromising script. The ending or final 30 minutes of the film is one of the greatest and most unforgettable endings in film history and is an ending that greatly doesn't answer any questions and will cause for a lot of debates with no clear or easy conclusions with Lee letting the viewers make up their own minds. An amazing and powerful ending.

The whole cast is amazing. Danny Aiello is excellent as Sal,the local pizzeria owner. Ossie Davis is brilliant as Da Mayor,a drunk with words of wisdom. Ruby Dee is fantastic as Mother Sister,an old woman who watches the entire neighborhood and has great scenes with Davis. John Turturro and Richard Edsen are amazing as Sal's sons Pino,Sal's oldest son who's racist against Blacks and Vito,Sal's youngest who likes Blacks. Giancarlo Esposito is outstanding and over the top as Buggin' Out,a guy protesting Sal's. Spike Lee is great as Mookie,Sal's Pizza delivery guy Bill Nunn is wonderful and iconic as Radio Raheem,a young man who loves his Radio. Paul Benjamin(ML),Franie Faison(Coconut Sid),Robin Harris(Sweet Dick Willie),Rosie Perez(Tina),Joie Lee(Jade),Samuel L. Jackson(Mr. Senor Love Daddy),Miguel Sandoval(Officer Ponte),Rick Aiello(Officer Long),Roger Guenveur Smith(Smiley),Steve White(Ahmad),Martin Lawerence(Cee)Leonard Thomas(Punchy)Christa Rivers(Ella),Steve Park(Sonny),Lois Ramos(Stevie),Frank Vincent(Charlie)and John Savage(Clifton)give good performances as well.

The direction by Spike Lee is brilliant and stylish,with Lee always moving the camera and giving the film a beautiful visual style with tilted angles and close-ups. Great direction,Lee.

The score by Bill Lee is excellent,powerful,sad and memorable and adds to the film's tone. A wonderful score by Bill Lee. The film has a great soundtrack with songs by Public Enemy(the classic Do The Right Thing Theme Song Fight The Power),Al Jarreau(Never Explain Love),Perri(Feel So Good),Ruben Blades(Tu y Yo),Steel Pulse(Can't Stand It),Teddy Riley Featuring Guy(My Fantasy)and more. Great soundtrack.

In final word,if you love Spike Lee,Dramas,or films in general,I highly suggest you see Do The Right Thing,an excellent,brilliant,flawless and unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that will stay with you after you watch it and belongs in every film lovers collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,2 August 2013
Powerful and affecting,"It's easy to see how it was assumed that the film would incite certain audiences to riot when it first came out in 1989. Spike Lee's feature is certainly a balls-to-the-wall, no holds barred sort of affair that sheds a lot of light on the community complexities in the urban environment, particularly in a cultural stew as diverse as Brooklyn.

Most interesting is how Lee uses a variety of cinema techniques to enhance the viewing experience in terms of exploring this neighborhood through the point of view of the characters and audience. The use of a hand held camera style is implemented periodically to break the fourth wall and demonstrate the variety of differences and prejudices that simmer behind the cultural and ethnic interactions of the neighborhood residents. It is through these devices that the film is able to weave an analysis of the relationship, that frequently conflicts, between love and hate.

It is here where the motivations of the characters come into play, and the true artistry of 'Do the Right Thing' shines. All of the characters are well rounded human beings, each with their respective strengths, and failings as individuals, representatives of their ethnic backgrounds. Their personal prejudices and pride (of which they all share a part of) resulting from their working class struggles often lead them into amusingly horrific conflict between the characters, and much of the tension is derived from these moments. Above all this, some characters are able to offer introspective analysis into the reasons for their destitution, whether it is because of their social standing or simply a lack of personal endeavor. It is up for the viewer to draw their own conclusions from the humanity that resides there, and the mistakes that are made.

But it is not just the multitude of colourful characters that bring this film to life, but the production design and cinematography as well. Colours are imbued with reds, oranges, yellows, and loud hues to portray the intense heat of this particular Brooklyn day. The racial tensions that hover over them only add to the weight on everyone's shoulders, and before we know it the film is spiraling into its riveting climax.

This is a film that will certainly leave you thinking, and while the unnecessary exposition at the end may leave one feeling as though Spike Lee may have undone much of the complexities explored upon earlier, ""Do the Right Thing"" is still a marvelously affecting experience that is truly a portrait of the cultural experience in an ever more closely connected world.",8.0,19 May 2012
Did Mookie Do the Right Thing....?,,10.0,17 December 2010
Almost nobody's right and almost everybody's wrong here:,"Do the Right Thing, which is set in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood on a hot, sultry summer's day, in the midst of a heat wave, is about a bunch of people of different racial and ethnic groups who, while at the same time living in relative harmony with each other, the omnipresent racial and ethnic tensions are always lurking and bubbling just beneath the surface, ready to erupt at any opportune (or inopportune) moment.

Do The Right Thing shows that when people of different racial and ethnic groups, none of who have very much, are thrown together by chance, these kind of racial and ethnic hostilities take root and proliferate very, very easily. Moreover, this film points out a very concise message about the consequences of racial and ethnic hatred and violence; There are no winners, only losers.",8.0,26 April 2014
Pass the Popcorn review,"Do the Right Thing, directed by the somewhat controversial Spike Lee, is a somewhat controversial movie dealing with hard topics like racism, prejudice and violence. Interestingly enough, it's also the movie that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama saw on their first date.

The movie is set during an extremely hot day in Brooklyn, New York. It revolves around a group of characters leaving there. Some of the most prominent characters in the movie are Mookie (Spike Lee) who works at Sal's pizzeria, Sal himself (Danny Aiello), Sal's sons Vito (Richard Edson) and Pino (John Turturro), and an old drunk bump called Da Mayor (Ossie Davis). It's hard to find the main narrative focus since the majority of the movie consists of characters just interacting. But the central topic of Do the Right Thing is prejudice and violence.

It's hard to stay neutral when you try to discuss what is the role of violence when trying to achieve racial equality. However, Spike Lee manages to stay neutral – during the whole movie he never says whether he considers violence to be justified or not. He just presents his characters like they really are, he presents them as real people. No matter if his characters are black or white, he presents them all as grey. This lack of definitive answer might annoy some people, but I had no problem with it. I liked how Spike Lee left the interpretation to the audience.

Apart from being a movie that could easily find its place in some philosophical/sociological/psychological debate, Do the Right Thing is also masterful on the technical level. Spike Lee amazingly uses awkward close-ups and camera angles to further portray the tension between the characters. Furthermore, the song 'Fight the Power' by Public Enemy is effectively used throughout the whole movie as a fitting soundtrack to the Brooklyn setting. The actors also do a pretty good job. John Turturro is great as the racist Italian Pino, Spike Lee is plausible and believable as the easy-going Mookie and Ossie Davis does a memorable portrayal of the drunk Mayor. Samuel L. Jackson's role as the local radio DJ is almost a cameo but greatly done. Do the Right Thing is truly good on every level, and its thematics are strong, shocking and important even today. I strongly suggest watching this Spike Lee joint.

Stereotype-free was one thing I read. Right. We've got Ossie Davis as a drunk, and a shiftless pizza delivery guy for openers. And remember folks, starting a riot is ALWAYS doing the right thing.

"A day in the life story about a racially diverse neighborhood in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn","Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing, is the most masterfully crafted movie that I have ever seen. I've watched this movie several times and every time I re-watch it I am stimulated and blown away. The characters in this movie are outstanding, there are no flat characters and by the end of the movie you feel as if you have grown up with them. The cinematography in this movie is out of this world. It is almost unbelievable that it came out in 1989, some techniques are so ahead of there time they look futuristic even by todays movie making standards, 9 out of every ten shots in this movie are works of art. Not only is Do The Right Thing artistically brilliant in almost every aspect it is also thoroughly thought provoking. You could view this movie then come up with a hundred discussion questions and discuss them for hours of scintillating conversation. If any one ever tells me that Spike Lee is a hack I tell them to watch this movie and they come back agreeing that he is a genius. I gave this movie a nine out of ten because I have yet to see the perfect movie but this one is about as close to perfect as you can get. 7.7 thats a travesty!

"""Always do the right thing.""","This was an interesting film. I don't know that I have a particular opinion just yet, especially regarding the controversy that surrounds it. There seems to be a lot of debate over which group of people this film portrays in a worse and/or better light, and what the final meaning people are supposed to get from it is. I think the intention was to get people talking about it in the first place. From there, I don't think any actual conclusions were made, it was left mostly ambiguous. There is no 'correct' answer. This leaves the audience accountable for their interpretations. Spike Lee presents an evocative piece, but it doesn't necessarily lean one way or the other. He tells the story and any leaves the audience to their own thoughts. You could probably tell a lot about a person, just based on their interpretation.

Aside from all this, I really enjoyed the cinematography. It was incredibly effective in conveying the heat, and the painted on color was just crazy! But great all the same. I loved the slightly overt filming style too, the camera feels like another person, and its perspective is somewhat sentient in nature.",8.0,8 May 2014
Do the right thing?,"The first thing worth noting about Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" is that the film revolves entirely around a message it presents. It's less of a movie you watch and more of something you experience.

""Do the Right Thing"" centers around a pizza delivery boy in a (nearly) all black neighborhood during the hottest day in Brooklyn history and the choice he makes in the last section of the movie. Building up to the end, the neighborhood is filled with unique characters with distinct personalities and how they live their everyday lives. ""Do the Right Thing"" is uplifting, practically a comedy, during the first half of it. Ultimately the racial tensions escalates and the film has a dramatic shift in tone.

Without giving anything away, Spike Lee presents a bitterly harsh reminder of the racial tensions of the time. It leaves the audience wondering if the right thing was done, or what the right thing to do even was. ""Do the Right Thing"" is a great film with great cultural significance and is certainly worth watching.",9.0,8 May 2014
Almost a masterpiece,"I decided to watch this movie after an English teacher of mine touted it as the greatest film ever made. I was somewhat skeptical upon hearing this, but that night I rented and watched it. Do the Right Thing is set in a primarily African-American area of New York City during the hottest day of the year, and is centered around an Italian-owned pizzeria. The first thing I noticed about the film was that it was absolutely brimming with the essence of the late '80s. The colors were bright, the music was relatively corny, and the costumes were strangely elaborate. I'm not a huge fan of the late '80s culture, but somehow the film was able to combine these features into a very watchable form. I was able to watch the entire movie without interruption (which is a pretty remarkable feat for me). As the story unfolded, I found myself becoming more and more frustrated. I believe that this frustration may have been intended by Spike Lee, but it somewhat diminished my enjoyment overall. Everyone in the film was so angry all the time, with the exception of Danny Aiello's character for the most part. I found myself repeatedly at my boiling point of rage when I saw how much ignorance was portrayed in the film. It seemed that much of the movie was sympathetic towards racism, as many of the situations that would rouse sympathy for African Americans were caused by their own ignorant actions. Most notably, the actions of Giancarlo Esposito's character struck me as extremely inflammatory. This film taught me one important lesson, however: Ignorance leads only to more ignorance. I was glad when, at the end, the text shown alluded to that idea. Before then, I was somewhat disappointed with the film, really. I felt like it was a movie that merely hated the white man, which wouldn't really appeal to a middle-class white kid like myself. Overall, though, I thought that this movie was pretty great, and for all my gripes, the story came together very well and exceeded the sum of its parts. 8/10",8.0,15 February 2011
Do the right thing review,"Do the Right Thing directed by Spike Lee was a good movie overall but one that really made me mad. This movie was very powerful and gave a look at the racism and tension that was going on in Brooklyn, Ny. It had tension between the piazza shop, the African Americans, and the Whites. It also fit perfectly with what is going on today with the police killing unarmed people. It really made me mad at the end because of all the rioting and destruction that the people did to the piazza place. The cops choked the man to death so they took it out on the piazza shop. It made no sense to me. I also didn't get why Mookie started the riot by throwing the trash can through the glass. I just didn't get it because he seemed like a really good guy. The movie technicality wise was great. The color they used was like a red orange type and it was great. They also did it perfectly showing how hot it was and what the people were going through. You could see the sweat and the colors just made it look very hot out there.",10.0,5 May 2015
missing the point,"It definitely seems like Spike Lee misses his own point in this film. From what I gather, he is advocating racism towards whites ( as a whole, that is. Apparently we are all the same as Italians) and there is no clear line about whether he advocates Ghandi-like non violent approaches, or if he suggests more outright protests against the establishment.

There is really just nothing to special about this movie. It's a view of life in the black ghettos of Brooklyn, and how all the different sects of race and people view each other. It even featured five minutes of them all talking smack about each other's flaws as a race. Even stranger, the older generations of the African Americans are being outright disrespected by the younger ones.

It also seems to me that Sal has done nothing wrong to the community, most everybody buys pizza there. He owns the shop, he should be able to put whoever he wants on the walls, if that tweaky guy wanted to see more black people, why doesn't he just open his own pizza place and dedicate a wall to his heroes? And, If I was the owner of a business, black or white Radio had no right to come in and blast his music (no matter what genre) I consider that disrespectful to anybody. Of course there was only one racist white guy in the whole movie, Sal's son, who at least sucked it up and did his job and didn't go around fighting with them or anything. Anyway, the portrayals of races in this movie were extremely stereotypical, and offensive to me.

In all, I would never watch this movie again, nor I will be taking the time to watch other Spike Lee works because he has effectively wasted my time and insulted me. Bleh.",4.0,16 December 2011

Is Color a Powerful Element?,"It is in Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing. A movie that will stand the test of time, Do the Right Thing is a film with issues of race, morals, money, power, and society. A story of love and hate. The film has elements of young and old. Younger generation and older generation. The colors of average black and white and modern rainbow. Like the look, the sound of the film is loud with obnoxious moments and silent and innocent. Even the moral of the film ends with two sides. Two ways of answering the message to the audience. A brave step in movie making. Wonderful character development, a terrific, original story line, and a setting which could only be shot on the real streets of New York City. Spike's best work!",9.0,8 July 2001
What is the Right Thing?,"Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" does not follow a conventual 3 act narrative structure. All the events in the movie happen in order but the focus of the movie is on characters just living their lives. The story takes place during a hot week in a Brooklyn Neighborhood. As temperatures run high, patience wears thin. The movie doesn't focus on a central conflict or have any real villain. It just focuses on neighborhood people having conversations. They talk about sports, music and other people in the neighborhood.

What the film does well is how it presents its theme. There is a running motif throughout the movie about the philosophy of violence. There are two quotes highlighting the differing doctrines of Malcom X and Martin Luther King Jr. The movie presents this question to the audience of when is violence the answer? And the movie does not give an answer to that question, they leave that up to the audience to interpret for themselves. The movie doesn't paint one side as the villain, there is fault to be had on all sides. Because of this, the movie never feels preachy. It just feels like it is telling us how it is, and then poses the question to the audience of: how do we make it better?

I think what the movie says and how it says it is very well done. I just don't care for the characters and story all that much. The characters are always yelling at each other and complaining. There is a romance story that I feel could have been cut out and I wouldn't have missed a thing. And there is one big element of the ending conflict that seems to come up out of nowhere and kind of derails the whole story.

So, I respect the movie for what it is. I like the way they handled their theme. But the story is a bit unfocused, the characters aren't compelling, and the ending make this fall short of this being great for me. Take that for what its worth and see if this is the ""Right Thing"" for you.",4.0,9 February 2023

Smiley tacking the picture back up together is still the scariest thing, in a way, that has ever been put on film. Hope Spike figures out a way to top this one someday; it would pretty much put him in the hall of fame to have two this good. If you haven't seen it, do.

''Yo! Hold up! Time out! TIME OUT! Y'all take a chill'',"And I need to take a chill too. I'm not going to give spoilers but you got to know that, despite being marked as a comedy on IMDb, ''Do the Right Thing'' abounds in high-rocketing tension powered by hate and harmful implicit biases that the characters bear with them. That tension will ultimately explode into one of the most brutal acts of violence ever seen on screen. It was so horrendously infuriating for me that I've dedicated this short review exclusively to what I saw and the subject of hate.

Spike Lee showed us every step that lead to that ending, so it's not unfathomable that something like this could happen but man... I' wish it were unfathomable, a work of fiction. But it's reality. A gruesome reality. At least I wished some of the characters came to the realization that Danny from American History X had, namely: ''Hate is baggage.'' but when it's continuously fueled like that no wise conclusion can be reached.

It has drained me emotionally, so I'll end it here.

Do the Right Thing,"Spike Lee's film Do the Right Thing, is a wickedly intense story of inner city racial tensions and the problems ethic groups struggle with every day. The film is based on a block in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn NY. Within this block there are many different races, each with a different way of life. This particular block is primarily run with African Americans, but the two main businesses weren't. The one a pizza shop run by Italians, the other a corner store run by Koreans. It shows a time in the world when the color of a person mattered more than the actual person. A street block in a city is only so big, so when racial groups mix and tensions grow major tribulations can unfold quickly. One may think that by the 1980's everybody was equal, but racism was still strong. Black pride had become a key part in the growth of our nation, but the struggles during this time were frightening; Violence always seemed to be the answer. As shown, even something as seemingly innocent as music could create such a tension that violence was threatened. Everybody on the block had to make decisions every day. The decisions such as what time you were going to go home. These may not seem like a major dilemma, but sometimes what time you came home may change the rest of your life. Every character on the block, regardless of their age, race, or purpose in life had to make decisions each day. When situations erupted and authorities needed to be called in, it didn't always make things better because the Police officers were forced to make tough decisions too. Police officers were known to the resistance to equality was vast. You walk away from this film analyzing and deciding for yourself whether the characters made the right decisions. If they didn't what would have happened to this little block in Brooklyn?",8.0,8 May 2010

"Do The Right Thing, (1989)","I thought this movie was great, from the effects, lighting, cinematography, the humor and the drama it was a well made movie. Various people would not like this movie because of the vulgar language, fighting and race cards they pull in multiple scenes but I think that it was put the movie together. I love how Spike Lee is the director and also uses himself as the main character. I think Lee is hilarious and made the movie 10x better by being the main character. The music was awesome, and the camera angles were amazing. I loved the dutch angle shot when the music man with his boom box goes into the pizzeria.

The Wars,"I'd rank these directors in order of preference from least to greatest Ice Cube, John Singleton, Spike Lee, and Oliver Stone. Why? Ice Cube hasn't made any dominant impression. John Singleton lost the power he tried tapping into with Boyz N the Hood, he's since been ignored with work like 2 Fast 2 Furious. Spike Lee and Oliver Stone get the biggest flack from a lot of critics, I can see why real easy...

Lee is focused on one dominant topic in his work: race. Stone is more varied. They both suffer from frequent dryspells and insufficient work, but Stone doesn't try consistently hammering a similar point over and over. Therefore, if I had to say ""watch one Spike Lee joint"", this would be it.

Do the Right Thing transports the social problems of Salem into urban America on the low-level community scene where they previously dominated. Between race war, class war, pride war, heritage war, authority war, domestic war, the movie is a molotov cocktail ready to blow sky-high.

Yet there's something more unsettling about it and that's how Lee tries infusing humor, thus contradicting his efforts. Waiting until the end to make his point is not effective filmmaking. The acting itself ranges from animated caricatures to the ""real thing"". Sadly, most of the characters are less about interactivity and more about cramming another style of character on film.

Overall, this is a vision with some points despite some ineffective moments. (75%)",9.0,31 October 2003
What's the right thing?,"Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" is a picture of a moment in time. A moment in time in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, with all its casual beauty of teeming life, well, as teeming as life can be when the relentless sun makes the blood boil... This particular moment in eternity lasts a day and we follow the lives of the black community and an Italian pizzeria owner and his sons, who have established themselves in the 'hood. This is a flic made by black people about racial tensions, shot entirely on location and basically portrays the real thing with some dramatic artistic license. The cast of black actors works right down to the bit parts, providing the necessary authenticity for the milieu the movie tries to depict. Spike Lee himself is outstanding, but so is Ossie Davis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Turturro and others, but the Oscar nominated Danny Aiello gives the performance of his lifetime as the owner of the local pizza parlor caught in the center of the emerging trouble.

Spike Lee shows two sides of the same coin with death and destruction written on it. Flip it as you will. The director doesn't judge the two sides. He happens to play a character in his film, and all of them have flaws, Lee's Mookie included. Only ""Da Mayor"", the old man, raises the voice of conscience and reminds everyone: Do the right thing! But is someone listening to the voice of reason when the hottest day of the year brings the harsh urban reality to the forefront? The mayhem that ensues follows the simple rule of consequence where one thing leads to another to inevitably snowball into a catastrophe. It leaves lives in shambles. The only thing that becomes apparent is that the fight isn't over, it's just not the fight against each other that can make any difference. There are no easy answers, but there's not much choice left, and it is dictated by a simple truth: We got to fight the power that be - and that's the triple truth, Ruth!",9.0,4 August 2012

Stylish but awful plot,"The colours are bright and coordinated in each scene. The movie looks really nice but thats about as far as it goes.

The plot is awfully tendentious and makes statements which are so obvious that i almost blushed while watching. Racism and poverty are important issues. So is also the circumstances under which many people live in the major cities. There are many ways to discuss those, and other political issues in the form of movies. This movie is not one of the most appealing ways as it underestimates the intelligence of its viewers in its categorical manner and lack of nuances. Its is still quite nice that that very brightly coloured script with its categorical views corresponds very well with the appearance of the pictures in the movie.

Hardly as good as many here claims, i guess they're just blinded by nostalgia. Nevertheless it is still better than the average American mainstream movies.

Love and Hate in the hottest day in the neighborhood.,"Spike Lee has a tight class of showing racism in movies. That happens as he writes and directs a mind-blowing drama called, ""Do The Right Thing."" This is the best film of 1989. Itis also one of the important movies of our time that shows the raw emotion of racism. The story takes in New York City on a hot day in the summer, which is perfect for the film's intensity level. Racism is flowing through the neighborhood as everybody is telling their own opinion on race, sometimes offensive. Lee also keep us focused as we these people in the neighbor hood talking about the problem as is spread. As the day comes to a end, the racism soon explodes into violence. This movie is very good as for a movie about racism. Spike Lee keeps us on the edge of our feet as the growing rage turns into hard-hitting violence. What we have to learn is that we're the same people, but with different color skin. It's a wake-up to the society. Why use violence and hate? That's what Do The Right Thing does best. Spike Lee never let the camera shy away from the hostile violence in the neighborhood. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10.0,16 April 2011
Incendiary,"Leave it to Spike Lee to voice what many had been thinking, but few had the courage to say. In response to media reports of racially motivated violence, the up and coming filmmaker penned Do the Right Thing, a heated commentary on the racism inherent in our society, and the 'fight or flight' response triggered as consequence (and in the eyes of Lee, the former seems the much more likely option).

And there can be little doubt that while Lee's narrative may function as a story, (a political microcosm of the state of society; albeit a very dark outlook) it was primarily intended as a sort of rallying cry - for oppressed racial minorities to stand up and take back their dignity, by force if necessary (Lee's underhanded advocating of violence as retribution is one of the film's more disconcerting traits). The film consistently carries such a fervent tone throughout, as if meant to double as a speech at a political rally. Lee writes with a fierce passion, seemingly tailored to create controversy and raise an uproar - which of course the film did, when released in the heat of such hate crimes in the late 1980s (Lee raised a few eyebrows when he encouraged African American high school students to skip school to go see his film, claiming it was more important).

Visually, Do the Right Thing also boasts a style all of its own, with such a collection of bright colours, primarily red, smeared across nearly all the sets and character's costumes. Combined with the distinctly crafted appearances of the characters (flat top haircuts, bug- eyed glasses, colourful t-shirts and those infamous brass knuckles) and cinematographer Ernest Dickenson's edgy, off center camera angles, the film resembles a moving comic book, which fits the film's motif of being not quite reality, but near enough to serve as a precautionary message. The larger than life characters strut through a larger than life society, tensions high as a powder keg due to the immense heat, all accompanied by the pounding strains of Public Enemy's 'Fight the Power', and Lee's own father Bill's jazzy riffs. And Lee's powder keg doesn't just go off - the film gives the impression of actually exploding in a blast of erupting testimonies, vivid colours and crashing music. One might describe it as the cinematic equivalent of being tear gassed at a rally - the comparison hardly seems far off.

However politically motivated his story may be, Lee proves an expert at crafting vivid and memorable characters, both visually and by their words and actions. However larger than life the characters may be, they carry an essence of truth, making some of the more incredulous plot points all the more poignant. Lee's cast rises to the occasion, and while few performances prove award worthy, the cast should be unanimously applauded for their collective intensity and for proving so memorable. Danny Aiello is a strong presence in the role of Sal, the pizzeria owner, and it sounds like off camera Aiello did an even greater service to his character, convincing Lee to rewrite Sal from simply being a racist bigot to a conflicted but ultimately caring man with demons of his own. (it would have been interesting to see what Robert De Niro, Lee's first choice, would have done with the role)

Character actor Ossie Davis is superb as the gentle and compassionate town drunk, self billed as ""Da Mayor"", one of the film's few morally sound characters. Spike Lee himself does a good job as Mookie, the film's central character, though one can't help but wonder if there might have been a more established actor who might have been stronger in the part. Giancarlo Eposito is a high point as the volatile ""Buggin' Out"", and John Turturro stands out as Sal's abrasive older son. The perfectly cast Bill Nunn is unforgettable as the rage filled Radio Raheem, obsessed with blaring Public Enemy on his boom box at full volume at all times to show his defiance for society. Nunn incites such frustration and anger in the audience that it isn't until after the film finishes it becomes clear how effective he was in the role. Watch also for a brilliant early Samuel L. Jackson, one of the film's highlights, as the 'voice of reason' figure - DJ ""Mister Señor Love Daddy"".

Do the Right Thing is one of those films that, no matter how hard you might try to leave it behind, remains pounding around the skull for quite a while afterwards. While the film's political stance can hardly be considered even handed, Lee's fiercely heated vision and vivid, highly memorable array of characters feel nearly enough to make audiences jump up and shout. Lee ends his film with two quotes: one from Martin Luther King, advising peace as the only solution to racial discrimination; and one from Malcolm X, supporting violence as justified and the only way of evoking change. Which, Lee needles, is the right thing? And it's a question that stands, to this day.

A lot of others say it was about the radio. I don't know who to agree with more, but I know for a fact that I can't disagree with any of them! The film was genius in the way that there was no moral to the story-line. Another great aspect of the film was the camera-work. I honestly haven't seen a film like that, where the characters are talking INTO the camera, as if the viewers are part of the movie. Or as if the camera was telling the story. The low angles on the taller people to show how tall and big and empowering they can be; the high angles on the shorter people to show how short and small they can appear made it very clear and an easy way to understand the things that the director, producer, AND editor wanted the audience to see.

An explosive wake up call,"Bearing all the negativity of racism and police brutality this is one of only a handful of films to explore the smaller, more delicate topics of racism and prejudice from the clashing between blacks and whites to unfair police intervention (the NYPD play a pivotal role in the demise of this brilliant film and questions are asked of which side of the law they are really on). Another film that touches this topic is Mathieu Kassovitz's 'La Haine', which is essential viewing in a political, but also a visually stunning sense. The storyline of Do The Right Thing is quite simple and straight forward; it follows the life of one particular individual named Mookie (Spike Lee) as he drifts through the day like any other before. He works as a delivery boy at the local Pizzeria under Sal and his fierce disdain of one of Sal's sons Pino, who is played superbly by John Turturro, creates an emphasis on the racial tension. In a sense this film does not truly take off until its demise due to all of the racial hatred being contained - in order to gather momentum - and when it finally does arrive it is an explosion of guilt and bitter anger that escalates racism to the peak of its deadly potential. The film works to great effect with the vivid surroundings of a true New York City neighbourhood; the nostalgic feeling to it allows us to venture onto the streets so we can breathe, smell and taste the tension through the scorching heat. With the film opening to the line 'Wake up' (quoted by Samuel L Jackson) we are already shown implications of Spike Lee's intentions. This film is seriously persuasive in its aim to make us think more about the problems in society in America and globally, and the fine script, direction and much of the acting is courtesy of Spike Lee, whom is in his finest hour. Please see this film to appreciate its unique qualities that are all so simplistic and obvious, yet still stand unchanged.",9.0,12 February 2005

very disappointing,"This should have been the first Spike Lee movie I saw. I would have gone into it with very low expectations and would not have been disappointed. Unfortunately, I saw this after seeing ""Clockers"", which I really liked. And unfortunately, everything I liked about ""Clockers"" was absent in this movie.

Of course I had a bad feeling about this movie as it started off with 4 1/2 minutes of a slutty looking woman having a seizure accompanied by bad music. Then 4 minutes of an inane morning dj spouting a string of unconnected meaningless words.

Direction: He had his moments, but it was pretty much a 2-hour music video. Cinematography: After 10 minutes my eyes hurt from orange. After a half hour my head hurt from orange. The next day I'm still not seeing colors correctly after 2 hours of nothing but orange. Characters: What characters? There were a lot of bodies, but no real people. Everybody was very one-dimensional. Acting: Might have been OK had there been anything for the actors to work with. Story: Could have been taken care of in 20 minutes. Music: Very disappointing after the excellent original music in ""Clockers"". The music was as shallow as everything else.

On the other hand, the riot scene was pretty good and would have made a good short.",3.0,21 November 1999
Gotta fight the power that be...,"At first I was not fond of Do the Right Thing. The opening credits sequence was jarring and more than a little objectifying, and the film after that seemed to operate to an entirely different rhythm and aesthetic than I was used to. Eventually, though I fell into that rhythm, and became entirely invested in things. I'm still not sure if I like Lee's style, but it's definitely one that has its merits.

Do the Right Thing is the story of one summer's day day in a New York ghetto on which numerous racial minorities converge in explosive ways. At its best, the movie manages to invoke a sense of community and capture a broad amount of people in a short amount of time. It also perfectly captures that lazy summer-day feeling, or at least it does for the mostly plot less first three-quarters, making it oddly work as a chilling-out movie. At its worst, the movie resorts to a didactic ""why can't we all get along?"" liberalism. Still, there's more good than bad here, and if it's not the total artistic success that it's been made out to be, it's still an unique and challenging film.",8.0,4 May 2012
A truly great and powerful film,,9.0,12 November 2006
A triumph,"Vibrant, powerful, energetic, artistic... there's a lot to get stuck into with this film.

It boasts creative and artful direction from Lee, with a great collection of characters and performances. The dialogue is well tuned and always engaging, and the overarching themes are strongly presented and explored.

I think at times the acting was a little over played as were some of the scenarios, but this never became a problem and added an interesting layer to the film.

Do the Right Thing really excels with its plot, which perfectly plays out. The tension builds and builds to a roaring crescendo which is full of impact and poignancy.

An intense and gripping drama which will be sure to keep you glued to the screen.",9.0,19 September 2021
Spike lee: the master of cinematic tension.,"Do the right thing is a great movie. It is a thoroughly unbiased view of race relations in America but it is also an effective comment on human relations as well. Their is never clear cut segregation between the races represented in this film. The truly prejudice and intolerant are there but by in large represent the minority. The movie isn't limited by differences in race alone touching on relations between male/female, young/old, poor/wealthy and so on. The movie is both funny and slightly somber at times forcing the viewer to ask themselves ""is there a clear cut right and wrong in this movie?"" ""did Mookie do the right thing"". ""Who should pay the price for the injustices committed by conglomerate perpetrator? At the end is there no one to blame or every one to blame. I've seen it several times and I'm still wondering.",9.0,25 June 2006
Did Mookie do the right thing?,"This is by far one of the most powerful and thought provoking films i have seen to date. The film deals with the racial tensions between the different races inside of the city. Our main character Mookie seems to be in the cross hairs of the tension amongst the community members of his block, being cool with whomever he comes in contact with, only really caring about how much money he has in his pocket. Working at Sal's pizza shop he mixes with everyone from the block because everyone has grown up on his pizza. it isn't until the hottest day during a brooklyn summer where the tension between some of the locals and Sal turns violent due to the lack of black history memorabilia on Sal's wall amongst many other things. Is Sal the power that Radio's boom box has been talking bout? This film brings to the surface many stereotypes that've been embedded into our culture not to make a point for any certain person place or thing but as a reminder that these things happen.",10.0,12 May 2015

Can You Say Overrated?,"I had never seen this movie in its entirety until last night. I was expecting something on par with say 'Boyz n the Hood (1991)'. I was very disappointed. I am a white boy from the Midwest, but I connected with the story and characters in 'Boyz n the Hood'. I just don't get what all the fuss is about with this movie. It wants to explore the complexities of racism and make some kind of statement about people needing to show some respect to each other, even if they are from different environments and backgrounds and cultures. But in the end, I didn't really connect with the story or the characters or the plot. I agree with other posters here who stated that in many scenes the characters seem to be just shouting back and forth and not really acting out roles. In the end this has got to be one of the most overrated movies that was loved by critics everywhere. Spike may be da man, but this was a swing and a miss IMHO.",5.0,2 December 2004
Exuberates A Powerful Message,"I enjoyed this movie very much. It showcased a host of different messages. The messages were not only geared to the youth, but was geared towards everyone. The message of hope, the message of anti-racism, the message of freedom, the message of hate, the message of self-hate, the message of power, the message of money and the message of respect, all ties in to the film magically. I believe simplistic art portrays the best beauty of all. This film may seem very simplistic, however the content, the form and the overall production really captures the fruits of issues we have in our society( even up until this day). The lighting and editing really stood out in the film making of this project. Spike really created an artful masterpiece!",9.0,11 May 2013
Amazing film!!,"Hi, my name is Nick Altomare and recently I watched Do the Right Thing in my history of American cinema class at Hudson valley community college. I liked this movie a lot because of its style and New York City flare. It displays many real life occurrences that happen in the city an shows many views and attitudes of other people. It teaches many good lessons and shows how to act or not respond to many situations. The setting and characters are phenomenal.

"""And that's the double truth, Ruth!""","""Do The Right Thing"" makes for a great experience, despite the worry of protests and violence that audiences believed were going to happen. The actors are fun: Spike Lee is impressive, it's a blast seeing characters portrayed by Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, and I nearly flipped head-over-heel when I found out the DJ character was played by Samuel L. Jackson. I think the definitive thing that drew me in with this film was the fact that the story was shot over a course of a day, while the camera dropped in on nearly every character in the neighborhood. It jumps around as a constant, but the transitions in it work so well that you could of sworn this movie behaves more like poem than it does a motion picture.",9.0,11 December 2011
Loved it.,"First of all, this movie just kept changing for me. Like my perception was being changed. At first, because of the credits, I thought it was going to be a boxing movie. But then of course it wasn't. Now I believe the credit shots were just to go along with the song and emphasize the meaning. Then I found the movie to be really amusing and funny. The characters would sometimes be abrasive, but ultimately it would be resolved and all was well. But then the ending completely took me by surprise. It was not at all what I had expected, I almost couldn't believe it. The character that I originally thought would cause a huge problem, did not. Instead an entirely different scenario occurred. This film was just amazing and powerful. It had great messages about racism and violence. I think more people would benefit from watching this today. The reason I am only giving this an 8, is because it's a movie that I'd have to be in a certain mood to watch again. It's intense, so I would have to be up for it.",8.0,9 May 2013
do the right thing,"Do the right thing was a really good movie. I wasn't really sure what to expect out of it. After watching it i got a really good idea of how race is still a big issue in many parts of the US.

DO the right thing is about an inner city community that faces with race day to day. From the abusive cops to the pizza's down the street. It focuses on the idea that even in such a small tight community were everyone knows one another there is still racism.

I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good comedy with a point. This movie was not only funny it really got its points of view on race and the way of life in the city really is. It helps people like me view what they go through day in and day out. Do the right thing is a movie that everyone should rent and watch. I guarantee that you will enjoy it.",9.0,26 May 2005

One hand is always fighting the other hand,"One of the best aspects of film is its ability to capture a feeling. Spike Lee more than accomplishes this in ""Do the Right Thing"", encapsulating the merciless Summer heat while being playful with the color palette. The entertainment level here is high, between the dialogue and the who's who of future '90s stars (seriously, *everyone's* in this movie).

That sweltering heat is the ideal backdrop for festering racial tensions, but what's refreshing is in the way Lee goes about it. Empathy exists on both sides of the battle line. Good and evil aren't so easily defined, and there are those in the wrong, but no one's really a bad guy. Except for the police, which is what makes this uncomfortable even today. But the characters don't exist solely to represent sides, and I think that's what makes this still resonate.

Great Movie,"This movie was a great movie to watch. I watched it along with 15 other classmates. It was great but the end of the movie had an unbelievable twist. I like how the movie had everyone laughing and at the end, everyone sad. One of my favorite parts of the movie is when a white guy stepped on a man foot and everyone was hyping it up so they can fight. but This movie is how the world is today. Bunch of racist cops and at the end, something happened to a guy that actually happened in real life about a year ago........ (see for yourself) Crazy how a movie predicted that. But other than that i will give this movie a 9 out of 10",9.0,9 November 2015
Do the Right thing,I really enjoyed this movie. It shows the blindness people can have sometimes and how it is better to lead than follow. In this Drama in brooklyn a delivery boy mookie played by the director spike lee seems to be in the center of all the tension in the neghborhood. There is a very good cast in this movie. The characters do a really good job at acting like a person from the inner city by the way they talk and there manorisms. I really liked how the lighting had a yellow hue to it as to express the heat of the day in which the movie events all took place. I also liked how the radio host was a bit of a narraorator throughout the film. I really enjoyed it and liked the job spike lee did on this film i think its a must see.,10.0,8 May 2013
A two-hour bickering fest... albeit staged like a Technicolor musical!,"Hyped-up, late 80's account by writer-director Spike Lee on ethnic tensions culminating on a hot summer's day in a Brooklyn neighborhood, NYC.

To me, this is another zeitgeist film that hasn't quite stood the test of time. Definitely made with the best of intentions and some really good performances, but its energy goes into overdrive (and overlength) that turns this into a two-hour – increasingly tiresome – profane bickering fest where as good as every scene leads to a loud racial bigotry outburst. Told with overblown, huge gestures and (surprisingly) staged and choreographed like a stylized Technicolor musical! I kept urging for a more subdued, nuanced tackle on the indeed always important subject, instead of a growing headache.

Do The Right Thing Makes You Think.,"Do The Right Thing by director Spike Lee, is an excellent film that brings to light many issues on race, and socioeconomic status. The film's plot is ambiguous, and is more about the goings on in Bed Stuy during the events of one day. The film has very sharp colors that pop out at you, and the lighting is crucial in telling the story. The lighting is a dark orange tint to signify the sweltering heat present on that day. The acting is excellent, and the characters all fit into the bigger picture quite nicely. This is shown exceptionally well in the character of Smiley. His purpose isn't really made clear throughout the movie until the end. I won't discuss this as to not spoil it, but when you watch the film, you will see what I mean. The film makes you think, because the actions made by some of the characters can be interpreted in several different ways. The viewer makes their own conclusions as to the mindset of the characters. Overall, the film is fun, and makes you think way after the movie finishes. This is what makes it great.",8.0,6 May 2014

It's frightening to think that this film is still just as powerful and thought provoking today,"Despite the fact that Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" deals with complex and sometimes uncomfortable themes (such racism and poverty) it isn't preachy and it's not a hateful film. The acting and cinematography are top notch and most important of all, it's thought provoking. After seeing it, I wasn't sure what to think about the characters in the film. I challenged myself to answer the following questions: Do any of the main characters in the film ""do the right thing""? Why does Mookie act the way he does during the riot? What would have happened if he had not acted the way he did? How do the quotes at the end of the film relate to what happened? It's the kind of movie that really sticks with you and will have you thinking about it days after you've finished seeing it. It may start off slow, but the conclusion is well worth the wait. I am actually surprised to find that it is still just as powerful, relevant and thought provoking today as it was when it was first released in 1989. (On Blu-ray, July 27, 2012)",9.0,12 December 2014
Do the Right Thing,,8.0,4 May 2010
What is right?,"Through the sweltering heat the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn enters another ordinary day. Italian Sal (Danny Aiello, who received an Oscar nomination for this role) together with his sons: racist Pino (John Turturro) and well-meaning naive Vito (Richard Edson) open up their pizzeria, the dining epicentre of the district. Mookie (Spike Lee), working as a delivery guy, has little regard for time or responsibilities, including taking care of his fiancée Tina (Rosie Perez) or their child. Amongst other inhabitants of the colourful and vibrant area are boombox and Public Enemy fanatic Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn), machine-gun wisecracking radio entertainer Mister Señor Love Daddy (Samuel L. Jackson), the benign Mother Sister (Ruby Dee) and hobo mentor living in inner-peace Da Mayor (Ossie Davis). This day however will be no ordinary day, as lives entertwine and cause an ultimate culmination of ideas and conflicts.

""Do the Right Thing"" Spike Lee's pivotal movie, which torpedoed him to from being 'just another Afroamerican director' to one of the most awaited voices of American cinema. Internally contradictory, as summarised by Lee himself just before the end credits, where both Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr are quoted from opposing spectrums of the debate. Although both respected each other one advocated a Gandhi-like revolution, while the other spoke on behalf of aggressive self-defence. These two ideas chaotically collide, collage, cooperate and deviate throughout the movie, as Spike Lee seems to ask the essential question, but offers not didactic response: What is the right thing? The character of Mookie is the bystander, who takes in the varying points of view to ultimately deliver a non-committal response by saving Sal from a mob through initiating an attack on his pizzeria. In this moment voices of reason collapse and ideals take a back seat for pure mob mentality. This action is compulsive and non-directed, much due to the fact that the community is not united behind a common idea, but split between opposing concepts (each character basically has his own set of beliefs). At the same time this action triggers a more profound social commentary - why is so much attention placed on the burning down of the white-owned pizzeria, but so little to the death of Radio Raheem which initiated these events?

The movie itself is also severely based on the mood. Unlike the majority of filmmakers Brooklyn here is zesty, colourful, full of ideas, music and thoughts, showing that the community has the ingredients for success. However the relentless scorn of the sun leaves the population devoid of action, without strength to react or initiate, so the characters mostly talk about revolution and change, but fail to follow through on their own words. The fact that heat is an outside force does seem to suggest that this state of affairs is caused by outside influence, but Spike Lee also points out (mostly through a conversation between three wise bums) that although the situation did come into place through external forces, it can not be used as a permanent excuse for inaction. Ripe with contradictions each character also deserves a separate analysis as to his meaning, mindset and purpose, such as the jobless slacker who attacks Mayor for not working (sic!).

A multilayered, but also witty comedy, which is the mantelpiece of Spike Lee's illustrious career, remains a powerful and unflinchingly relevant piece on race relations, despite occasionely being dated.",9.0,18 September 2012
You choose the Right Thing,"This film was a great way to show society how racism can destroy friendships and relationships. The film doesn't however, show you what is the right thing to do. It makes you decide what the right thing is to do. Because throughout the movie, every race is racist towards one another.

This film has it all, violence, humor, and of course race differences. It's a 2 sided film, sometimes you get angry at one race and feel sorry for another race. But all in all this movie was a good one to learn from. It makes you think about times that you could have been racist towards others. I recommend this movie to everyone. It's never too late to respect others for who they are not what color or race they are.",8.0,26 May 2005

"Definitely not flawless, but a great movie nevertheless","Do the Right Thing achieves something great. It manages to deliver a message on a controversial topic, while still managing to be extremely funny and entertaining.

The movie is funny and sometimes even silly, but is definitely not dumb. Spike Lee achieved something great here, but I do believe the movie is flawed. By the end of the movie, the message on violence and racism was clear as water to me, but it kind of gets lost in the way at times and the message itself may feel a little convoluted. So at many points in the movie I asked myself: Did he really want to say that? Or does he mean something else by it? So at times it is not as clear as you would want it to what Spike Lee is trying to address here. Also, I'm not sold on the opening, and although people may say it's art, it just feels unnecessary to me.

Overall, Do the Right Thing is a very powerful movie and, although it may get lost in the way, the message it conveys is important and one should look very closely when watching the movie, or you may miss it.",9.0,23 August 2015

Do You Do the Right Thing?,"Spike Lee is probably one of the most polarizing directors in American history. He's known to address issues within the black community but on occasion white viewers have been known to take offense to some of the aspects of his films. One of the most popular films he's released is Do the Right Thing where through a closely knit community he poses the question, ""Do you do the right thing?"" He tackles racism, from all angles not just white on black, he also addresses police brutality and even a bit of alcoholism with Da Mayor. What I was most surprised by with this film is Spike Lee's work on screen. I've known of him as a director but I felt like he really did a great job as Mookie and Samuel L. Jackson adds a little bit of humor to an otherwise very serious movie as the local DJ. This movie isn't good due to good acting though, it's more due in part to the question that the film poses and at the end you'll find Spike asking you who you thought did the right thing?",10.0,10 May 2011

Mookie is an A-hole,,4.0,12 February 2023
Hot hazy day gone bad......,"The 1989 film Do the Right Thing directed by Spike Lee, is by far one of the first films that showed both spectrums of the racist card that is still played in America today. The main characters in this film are; ""Mookie"", who is played by Spike Lee himself,"" Da Mayor"", who is played by Ossie Davis, ""Mother Sister, who is played by Ruby Dee, ""Radio Raheem"", who us played by Bill Dunn, ""Jade"" (Mookie's sister) who is played by Joie Lee, """" Smiley"", who is played by Roger Guenveur Smith ,""Buggin Out"" who is played by Giancarlo Esposito, and ""Sal"", who is played by Danny Aiello. In summary the film is about how a very hot day turned bad in one Brooklyn neighborhood. The neighborhood which is usually mild mannered, is turned all the way up in a matter of hours because of the heat. Little things that would usually get a pass, have no bars on this hot and hazy day and tempers are flaring! In this film the theme was about how one moment, one decision could change your life in a matter of seconds. I believe that the heat played a major role in the theme because I know from experience that hot weather tends to get people more rowed up when it comes to dealing with other people and different situations at hand. This film uncovers and depicts racial problems that others dare to touch. In the 2004 movie Crash race and prejudices are also showed all across the boards of different ethnicities. The one thing that I admire about both films is that either one of them is one tracked minded. They share all standpoints and are not biased. The film Crash does seem to have a little more grip on the necks of the African American actors and actresses, but it is all for the sake of film and sad, but true reality of the life that some African American's live.

A lot of motif's and up close angles were used in this film such as the picture that ""Smiley"" kept carrying around throughout the film. The now famous picture was that of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. in company of each other shaking hands. The whole reason why the neighborhood went out of whack is because ""Bugged Out"" was upset that"" Sal"" didn't have any pictures of African American's in his store, although he served an all black community. In the last scene of the film, Smiley the mentally disabled man walks into the store while it is ignited in fire and puts the picture of the two civil rights activists on to Sal's wall of fame filled with Italian American's. Another motif in this film was ""Radio Raheems"" radio. It was loud and it always played the same song! That song is the same song that started the fight in the restaurant and ended up being the reason why Radio Raheem was brutally murdered by the police. The camera angles that Spike Lee used were a lot of personal and close up shots. It enabled the viewer to familiarize themselves with the characters. It made you feel as if you were there in the film! This film was one of a kind and very much appropriate for its time. Race has always been an issue in the United States and I believe that it takes a bold director to unmask it. The thing that gets me is that all races involved in this film are minorities! Every ethnicity depicted in this film is frowned or looked down upon by someone else! Every believes that their struggle was and still is the greatest and instead of coming together to fight prejudices they fuel the flame to keep it going just to prove their point. This film is amazing and vibrant in laughs, but also shows us the seriousness of things and how our thoughts leads to decisions and our decisions lead to our actions and our actions sometimes lead to our fate or destiny.",9.0,20 March 2011

However, ""the powers that be"" are never identified, as every character in the film is strictly working class and not in possession of much power.

Do the Right Thing summary,,10.0,13 July 2012
Multi-leveled masterpiece,"Fight the power! It's a familiar saying but the question that goes along with it is...how? Fight it with love, or fight it with violence? It's an age old question that is as relevant today as in any other time period. It's the question Spike Lee's masterpiece, Do the Right Thing, tackles boldly, albeit harshly. Do the Right Thing takes place on a swelter summer day in a primarily black neighborhood in Brooklyn. The day begins peaceful enough, but tensions flare and tempers rise as the day gets hotter and more uncomfortable. The film presents a colorful clash of characters that move through a series of seemingly trivial matters throughout the day, all building towards the violent boiling point where the racial tension shatters and chaos erupts. It's a visually electric film with a story so ingeniously woven, full of characters so beautifully crafted. This film has changed the face of racial tension in film by being overtly powerful and shockingly compelling.

This isn't a film that demonizes one particular side of the race war. It doesn't take a side and it tells its story from multiple perspectives. It digs down deep into the tension and examines a close group of characters to the fullest extent. It may seem like the white people in this film are the villains, those who cause all the problems and all the trouble, but when compared to the black people in the film we learn that we're all cut from the same flawed and troubled cloth. Nobody is all good, but nobody is all bad either. Do the Right Thing levels the playing field and aims to give the world a reality check. It's not all black and white out there, and the film throws this in our face, even in the way the film is designed with its bright neon colors that contrast with one another and make everything in this backwards Brooklyn neighborhood pop out. Here's a film that displays multi leveled storytelling at its finest, never faltering and getting its point across very well.

The great thing about this film is that it doesn't preach to us even thought it has such a strong message. It has action, it has excitement, it has an eloquently human side to it that makes it all the more compelling. Do the Right Thing is an illustrious film with lots of bells and whistles in the form of quirky characters and wild situations. The incredible thing about this film, however, is how it pulls all of these quirks and nuances together to paint its bigger picture. There is all kinds of symbolism here that Lee employs through his stylistic camera work and his moody and powerful script. Do the Right Thing is a film that works on so many levels, and I plan on seeing it multiple times so as to collect all of the brilliance it has to offer. This is an incredibly well made, incredibly important film that is an absolute must see.",9.0,30 November 2011

I do understand that Spike Lee made this important film that showed all sides of a race divided neighborhood and how they interacted, but it was so bad in my opinion. I would never watch it again. The film was well made, with differences in filming that reached out to directly involve the audience at times, but most of the time little made sense. I did like the color vividness, but the all yellow in the beginning was a bit odd and it took a while to adjust to it. The one part that I did like in the film was when Sal was talking to his son about how he would never sell his pizzeria and why. However, that was really it.",2.0,6 May 2014

Review for History of Cinema,"i really enjoyed this Spike Lee film, it was my first by him. SPike Lee touches on the changing scene of Brooklyn, NY. I think that he chose this topic as a means to show how racism is seen everywhere and that when pushed too far all hell can break out. the movie revolves around a BK community in the bed-stuy area, mostly consisting of blacks with a few italians, who present the racial conflict in the movie. with the pressures of an intensely hot summer day the boundaries of racism are pushed to the limit. At one point, in order to stop a young black man from killing the Italian pizza shop owner, cops grabbed the young man and strangled him with a night stick, eventually killing him. I realize this is used as an example of racism being linked with police brutality, but i still think they way it was presented was a bit extreme.",8.0,11 May 2011
DO the right thing,I had never seen a spike lee film and I am now a fan. This movie was very good. For most of it I really thought that it was a comedy and just showed the views of the directors up bringing. I did think the picture of the movie was strange at first but the use of yellow really did help to emphasize the heat and the costume design and everything just enforced how hot it was. Even the dark apartment with fan set seemed so humid it actually reminded me of how hot my room is in the summer. I loved this movie though and the Italians at the pizza shop had me laughing a ton. The shot where the different races all insulted each other was awesome. The ending was good but avoidable the guy with the radio didn't need to die and I just feel like the trash can through the window just made the situation worse.,9.0,13 May 2016
elvis was a hero to most....but he never meant @!#$ to me,"Man what an excellent collage of golden-red-sepia nostalgic tones and Brooklyn colors, humor, hip-hop jams and classic inner city characters. I've worked in a pizza shop myself downtown and I can tell you this is all real, most of these people and situations exist in one way or another, even if they're not as dramatic in actuality. The film was a love note to Brooklyn. You literally felt the sweltering heat throughout the entire film, a number of times I felt like I ought to wipe my forehead. I think it was admirably honest about race-relations, and I liked how it didn't just concentrate on the racism and ignorance of certain white people but also the sad anger and senselessness of some black people and interestingly enough I think we can identify with all of that, there aren't any clear explanations or messages in the film, in fact the ending feels hopeless but it begs our attention and asks us to look around.",10.0,19 December 2012
Incendiary,"When the character Buggin' Out asked why there were no pictures of ""brothers"" on the pizzeria walls, would it have killed Sal the owner to put up a picture of Malcolm X or Martin Luther King or Eldridge Cleaver on the wall? When Mookie doesn't like the fact that maybe Sal might be attracted to his sister Jade, would it have killed him to be firm but polite with his boss?

What bothers me about the people in ""Do The Right Thing"" is that the potential peacemakers in the story are overshadowed or out-shouted by the ones who use violence to make their points. Do you see any strong effort to tolerate one another's differences? Do you see any one trying to get over their feelings of disgust and despair and anger and hurt? They are always in each other's faces, even the meekest characters, and so is Ernest Dickerson's obtrusive camera. It's shoved up so close to the actors and the ground that everyone begins to take on iconographic qualities, and everything in the movie seems blown way out of proportion. You feel like you're witnessing the incessant bickering of the gods on Mount Olympus.

I don't think Martin Scorsese's influence on Spike Lee is good. It's as if ""Do The Right Thing"" is intent on ending in violence, but the end isn't tragic. When Radio Raheem assaults Sal after his boom box has been destroyed and ends up dead at the hands of the police, do we really feel like the man had no other choice but to take the law into his own hands? Not really. Radio Raheem's insistence on blasting Public Enemy's ""Fight The Power"" suggests he was itching for the situation to turn ugly. And Mookie did the neighborhood a favor by inciting his friends to total Sal's establishment. Sal is disgusted with his sons and his patrons anyway; he's better off picking up his insurance check and doing something else with his life. His elder son Pino doesn't want the business, and his younger son Vito doesn't seem smart enough to take it over.

Where in ""Do The Right Thing"" are the elements that make men act rationally in heated moments--like family, children, obligations, education, opportunity, hope? Some of the gripes the black men make in this movie are right on target; and some of them are nothing but incendiary whining. Does Lee hold up any hope for the men he presents to us? No, he doesn't. He's content with finishing them off in fire and disdain. In ""Taxi Driver,"" Travis Bickle was at least trying to make things right. He goes mad doing it; and, if I'm reading Paul Schrader right, therein lies the shame of it. There isn't anything after this movie to ponder. No shame; no sense of loss; no echoes of regret. Only that the sorry people in this movie get on with their lives.",4.0,3 January 2000
Lushly piquant.,"Aside from having what seemed to be the longest opening credits in history (even though they are somewhat interesting for the liberal use of match cuts), this movie was deliciously piquant and kept my attention with it's interesting characters and dialog. The yellow/orange color wash effect was quite successful at super heating the feel of the movie and imparting the scorching summer temperature with a vivid lushness. I don't know if Mookie's actions were correct or not, but they did pull the attention away from Sal, Pino & Vito and allow the mob ""justice"" to be dispensed on the building instead.

**** him and John Wayne,"I could listen to Public Enemy all day, so even if the rest of the film is crap I wouldn't hate it. Danny Aiello and John Turturro are fantastic in this film about the powder-keg that is bigotry and hate. Spike Lee's acting is average, but his directing is excellent. I loved how at one point he didn't even bother showing the hate the characters had through actions or dialog, he simply had at least a half dozen of the characters spout their bigoted thoughts directly to the camera one at a time.

Samuel L. Jackson, as the radio DJ Love Daddy, plays a great role in the film, offering commentary and narration through a unique medium for films. The role of Da Mayor is also an excellent role and a voice of reason. I have much more respect for Spike Lee after watching this one.",9.0,11 May 2011
Here's a thought...,"After reading through the most recent comments posted for this film, I was amazed at how many viewers were appalled at Mookie's actions when he tossed the trash can through Sal's window. They even go so far as to say how wrong Mookie was to do something that destructive over a matter as trivial as pictures on a wall. These people need to watch the movie again. Mookie did not throw the can because of pictures; during the film, he couldn't care LESS about the pictures. Mookie tosses the trash can because he just watched one of his friends get murdered in cold blood by New York's finest.

Suppose you're at a 7-11, and one of YOUR best friends is involved in an altercation with the manager. You're there watching, yelling at them to break it up. The cops arrive. They drag your friend to his feet, then proceed to strangle him to death, right there in front of you. They dump your best friend's body in a squad car and take off down the street. You're standing there in front of this 7-11 with the manager. There's a brick by the front window of the store. What would you do? Would it be the right thing? Tell me with a straight face that you would so something different. Make me believe you.

On the Criterion DVD of this film, Spike Lee states that he has been asked many times whether or not Mookie did the right thing. He also states that NOT ONE PERSON OF COLOR has EVER asked that question, because from where they stand, there IS no question. A pizzeria is not worth a human life.",9.0,20 February 2003

Ambiguous by design,"I love Spike Lee's movies for their literary qualities. ""Do the Right Thing"" is no exception. Visually, the movie gives lots to absorb and analyze (odd camera angles, lots of red and orange to drive home that it's the ""hottest day of the year""). On the surface, Lee's characters seem one-dimensional; in reality they are quite multi-faceted. Each character can be interpreted quite differently based on the biases the viewer brings to the film. No one is completely right. No one is completely wrong, and they are all full of contradictions. Each action ultimately has a consequence.

Too many people criticize the movie for being ambiguous: that was the point. The movie is full of ethical questions about race and violence that don't have right answers. It's the Malcolm vs. Martin debate all over again. (But then, if you know anything about Malcolm and Martin, you know that they were aiming for the same goal if through different means).

""Do the Right Thing"" requires the audience to actively synthesize and question what is happening. It does not provide the answers. Therein lies its brilliance.",,4 February 2002
Scenes from a racial struggle in New York,"While the film spoke volumes about racial tension, it seemed to get too caught up in those expressed lines. When the film wasn't overdoing the conflict between the Italian and Black characters, it really made for quite a piece of work. Maybe this should have been a film about nothing, a film about the everyday existence between two groups of people who have different cultural values and sentiments. While the movie delivers on many levels, its self indulged racial tension proved to be too overdone, which turned the film into nothing more of a caricature of itself.",8.0,20 May 2002
Fantastic,"Brilliant filmmaking. Provocative. From the moment Rosie Perez dances to Public Enemy's ""Fight the Power"" during one of the greatest opening credits role ever, all the way to the incendiary scenes at the end, this is a film loaded with indelible images and meaning.

The film shows us racial tension in everything from countless microagressions to loud and very blunt comments, each of which you might think would lead to violence, but which is all just a part of this community (though eventually the lid boils over). It's packed with references, e.g. The 'Tawana told the truth!' graffiti and the long list of musical artists the DJ rattles off, and then of course the scene of excessive lethal force used by the police, which was decades ahead of its time in terms of calling attention to a systemic (and horrifying) problem.

Spike Lee's writing and direction in this is excellent. He evokes the atmosphere of the Bed-Stuy neighborhood of Brooklyn in the sweltering heat. He uses tilted camera angles and close-ups to amplify emotion. He lets actors communicate with their eyes, such as the scene where the white cops drive by the three middle-aged black guys talking on the sidewalk and they eye each other, or the scene where Spike Lee and John Turturro's characters watch the latter's father (Danny Aiello) flirt with his sister (Joie Lee, Spike's real-life sister) - both of which are fantastic.

There are lots of other great moments, such as Turturro's character struggling to explain why the black athletes and celebrities he admires are somehow 'not black' or different from the African-Americans he sees around the neighborhood, and later the conversation he has with his more tolerant father. It's a great set of characters, most of which have a lot of nuance to them, and an excellent cast. And bless Ossie Davis in this movie, his character is so fantastic (""If we don't stop this and stop it now, we're going to do something we regret for the rest of our lives!""), and I loved seeing his moments with Ruby Dee, who has a great scene herself when she laments the destruction.

The film toes the line of advocating violence, but ultimately I don't think it does so. I think Lee was simply trying to explain why it happens, and giving us a little education to go along with the entertainment. I think he's saying the titular ""Right Thing"" (or the ideal thing anyway) is always peace, but it becomes next to impossible to do that when your neck is being stomped on. The quotes from Martin Luther King and Malcolm X at the end were a brilliant way of showing this, and to me reflect two sides of the same coin. This is a great film, and one I think which will rise even more in appreciation for what it stands for as the years pass.",9.0,26 January 2022

An unfortunately timeless message delivered with style and substance,"While it's of obvious cultural importance, presenting race issues in film can be as tricky as any genre, and there's a trap of a polarized white villain vs black hero narrative that's easy to fall into. It's in expressing the deep nuance of these complex issues where this film truly stands out. It shows that there are flaws in the oppressed and virtues in the bigots, but shines the light on the ugly prejudice that exists in everyone. It also doesn't wallow in tragedy and churns out a truly entertaining picture.

"A bit dated, but still historically important","When I first saw Spike Lee's `Do the Right Thing' in 1989, I felt like I had just experienced a revolution in filmmaking. I had, but at 15 I didn't realize that the revolution went beyond the (at the time) radically different cinematography that helped tell the story, along with the explosive dialogue. Do the Right Thing was the beginning of a wave of important African American cinema that defined its culture beyond blaxploitation. Watching it again 15 years later, its personal importance as a film that inspired me to want to study or possibly make films has not diminished, but perhaps the fire that it lights under the subject of race relations is just a bit less hot. Perhaps it is because, like with violence, we as the viewers have become desensitized in a politically correct era and therefore consider this film to be preachy because it doesn't give us the answers in a candy-coated manner. Regardless, Do the Right Thing remains a relevant film that is important to film history.

"As a black man, I support Sal.","I did not grow up in America. As a matter of fact, I grew up in a place where brothers are more oppressed than America. One thing that I learnt from oppression is that you can't get your way through violence. Sal was an honest businessman running his business and paying tribute to his own kind in his own way. He had the right to do that, seeing that America is a free country, as I am led to believe. However, Mookie and his gang of misfits, felt that they were entitled to partake of the fruits of the fight by their predecessors(Malcolm X and MLK) in every means possible. BULLSHIT! If they wanted to influence the state of affairs in that neighbourhood, they would have EASILY done it in a civil way without ruining a livelihood that was built from scratch.

"Y'all better ""do the right thing"" and see this movie!","Do the right thing is a 1989 movie. It couldn't be more dated. The techincolor style is so old. And the sayings and clothes and the music are old too. But that's what makes it a classic. I saw this movie on the FX and Bravo channel. Mookie, a black guy, is a guy who works at Sal's Pizzeria, an Italian store. Mookie has a go-nowhere job as a pizza delivery boy. Pino and Vito are his sons. Pino is the older, racist son. He seems pretty decent at first----pretty-------but then his racism develops as the time goes on, but then on the other hand,all his favorite persons are black. I believe Mookie when he says he wishes he was black. Mookie: ""Who's your favorite athlete?"" Pino: ""Magic Johnson."" Mookie: ""Favorite actor?"" Pino: ""Eddie Murphy."" Mookie: ""Your hair is kinkier than mine. And you know what they say about dark Italians. You wish you were black."" Coincidence. I think not. I think people who love/hate blacks wish they were black themselves. Especially if everyone they admire is black, and set their hair to look black themselves. Vito is the decent, younger son. His face is hideous but he's a pretty nice guy. He's friends with Mookie and everything. Sal---he's very mysterious. I mean, it appears that he's decent since he considers Mookie his son, but then the way he talks to Buggin' Out (Mookie's friend) is inacceptable. Buggin' Out: ""Why don't you put some brothas up on that wall!"" Says he when he sees there are only Italians up on Sal's ""Wall of Fame"" Sal: ""Hey, when you have your own store, you can put up all the brothers, sisters, neices, and nephews you want. But this is my store.""

As the movie goes on, people become less tolerant. Sal seems to get more bitter towards black men by the day, but when Mookie sister Jade, a black woman, comes in the store. He goes blank as if he's been flashed by a ray. He falls for her like a sack of bricks, and Mookie dosen't like it one bit. ""Stay away from my sister,"" he says. Story lines good: Actings good: Except for Spike Lee, for he, like in Jungle Fever, says words out of his mouth but he has no expression. Everyone else did great. Especially John Turturo and Danny Aielo. Go see it. Buy it at a store or look for in in the Bravo or FX channel. That's what I did. And I can't wait to see it again!",,7 August 2001
My favourite movie of all time...,"Spike Lee is my favourite director, and it depends on which of his old or new movies I like.

Maybe he has an irregular career, but Spike counts on masterpieces, in his youth and cinematographic maturity.

It was in 1989 when he brought us one of the most relevant movies ever. Do the Right Thing is a film which dyed itself with honor since its conception.

In America, critics and experts feared its release, even before it. Because of its controversy.

But that could not avoid a deserved ton of awards and an unforgettable legacy. It is preserved in the National Film Registry since 1999.

And we should not be.surprised. Maybe we will never watch another coexistence story like this, an ethnic clash disguised under a mask of adult comedy.

Visually, this Joint is beautiful. You can feel the warmest summer day, the sweat and the tension in the air of Bedford-Stuyvesant, where every character in the film lives.

Do the Right Thing touches plenty of topics in human nature, like sex, racism, friendship and more. This includes the title.

Its soundtrack also fits with the movie in an urban harmony.

Lee's film falls short of its excellent premise,"When I read Spike Lee's journals, I expected to be really impressed with the final product. I was extremely disappointed with the film. First, though, there were certain elements of the film that I thought were good: 1. I thought that Danny Aiello's performance stood out as extremely good. Of all the characters, he was the one with the most depth, I thought. 2. Spike Lee has a very strong aesthetic sense. Visually, the film was very interesting a lot of the time. I do think that he could have done more with the motif of extreme heat throughout the middle third of the movie.

3. Lee represents ambiguity well in places--for instance, he shows that despite certain racist elements ingrained in him, Sal/Aiello is not a bad person. Of course, I think he romanticizes the character of Sal in parts.

4. The scenes that did not have any dialogue (I'm especially referring to the riot scene) were very powerful. Lee builds suspense and interest extremely effectively.

Which brings me to my list of complaints.... 1. I thought Spike Lee's performance was atrocious, often comically bad. I think he should have skipped trying to be a complete auteur for the film and let someone more qualified play his role. The final scene with Danny Aiello is one of the best-written scenes in the movie, but Lee nearly ruins it with a wooden reading of his lines. 2. Much of the dialogue was extremely awkwardly constructed. Reading his journals, I had extremely high hopes for intelligent screenwriting, but I was really disappointed. I understand that Lee was trying to make many points about violence and about race, but I thought that he resorted to ""speechifying"" rather than assuming very much intelligence from his audience. By tacking on speeches about race relations, he missed a good opportunity to incorporate them more effectively into conversations.

3. Having Spike Lee's character of Mookie throw the trash can through the window of the pizzeria (by the way, did anyone else find it odd that they spelled it ""pizzaria""?) was a mistake, I think. It would have been far more plausible and more satisfying if someone else had commenced the riot. Spike Lee could have gotten his point across much more effectively had his character simply not done anything. 4. The film seems extremely dated, to the point where something that may have been comical in 1988 is simply not funny, whereas other elements that were not intended to be humorous have become amusing. This isn't something that I can necessarily fault Lee for, but it was rather distracting as I was watching it. 5. I just don't think that the writing is intelligent enough to do justice to Spike Lee's very important ideas about the topics addressed in Do the Right Thing.

What worries me, however, is that my problems with this film stem from the fact that I, as a white male, might never fully understand Spike Lee's perspective on racial issues. I want to be as objective as possible in my assessment of the film, but can I escape my own cultural and racial pigeonhole?",5.0,9 June 1999
Not a boring moment,"This movie kept me at the edge of my seat through the whole thing. It captured the attention with the coloring, fast pace, action, and humor. The relations between the characters was my favorite part, with great development and interactions, whether light-hearted or negative. After attending an inner-city school there were certain aspects I found particularly funny, though I might have been the only one, or at least the only one willing to laugh relative to those around me. It sparked a great debate after, and when I made my first point I found my voice was shaky and betrayed how much the movie had gotten to me. I am not sure whether Mookie did the right thing, but each person would have a different view of this, particularly dependent on their background and experiences. Though it was rather difficult to watch at the end, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants an amusing, high-intensity film.",,10 May 2013

spectacular film on bedstuy NY life in 89,"The movie do the right thing was directed by Spike Lee and produced in 1989. The film takes place in the BedStuy neighborhood in New York. The message was about poverty, race, and culture. The Bedstuy neighborhood had parallels to the Jewish Ghetto except the Bedstuy neighborhood was more diverse. The movie starts with introducing what life is like in the neighborhood. The main characters are Sal (Danny Aiello), ""Da Mayor"" (Ossie Davis), ""Buggin Out"" (Giancarlo Esposito), ""Mookie"" (Spike Lee), Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn), and Pino (John Turturro). Sal owns the neighborhood pizza shop called Sal's famous pizza. Mookie works as the delivery person. Pino is Sal's son who also works at the pizza shop. The cast is racially diverse and highlights interactions built on race. Racial slurs are thrown around, some which I hadn't heard before. A theme in the film is the heat because it was the hottest day of the year. The movie gets its name from a point in the middle when Da Mayor tells a passerby to always do the right thing. The inciting incident to the climax was a strike on Sal's Famous Pizza and the climax was a violent outburst between Sal and folks in the neighborhood. This resulted in the death of Radio Raheem. The social justice issue here is police brutality. Police brutality is actually a multi-racial issue and it's important to note not all perpetrators are white. However, the majority of victims of police brutality are black and it is a tragedy. Compared to The Great Dictator movie this one shared a theme of social justice.

Love & Hate Culminated into One Knockout Flick,"Spike Lee is one of the most beloved albeit controversial filmmakers of our time, with plenty of films under his belt that have either won over or divided audiences. His best work is known for analyzing racial tensions, contemporary media, urban crime and political dilemmas, all by peeling away the layers of life to reveal the brutal hypocrisies it offers. Arguably the film that really punched critics and audiences in the gut with such raw themes was Do the Right Thing, as it became one of if not the most critically acclaimed film of 1989, and for good reason.

Set on a hot summer day, the story focuses on the simmering racial tension in a Brooklyn neighborhood amongst the African Americans and Italian Americans, which soon turns to tragedy and rampage. With this in mind, the major cultural differences are prevalent throughout, but at no point does the film scrutinize one side only. While there are multiple characters around, each one shares their own perspective on life and race, thus rendering a connection to the viewers. The iconic words ""love"" and ""hate"" really do summarize the film well, as it's not good to use violence to solve your problems, yet it's also not immoral to use it in self defense. Admittedly, some of the archs do drag on, but it's no more to add in to the climax of the film, which to this day still has us debating on whether or not the main character Mookie did the right thing.

In addition to how full of personality the characters are, the dialogue is also packed to the brim with distinct street talk. Whether it'd be Mookie's interactions with his ""brothers"" or Sal and his boys, or the daily residents just talking to one another, the verbal language practically invents how the characters think, making them very relatable as well. From a visual standpoint, the style adds in to the film's vibrant nature. The decision to shoot with mostly deep reds really makes one feel the heat that the Brooklyn residents were experiencing. The usage of viewpoints and angles are done to great effect, as they add in to the tumultuous and unpredictable tone displayed throughout the feature. For one of his first features, Lee really knew how to be playful with the equipment needed.

So needless to say, while it may be hard to stomach at times, Do the Right Thing succeeds in displaying the honest nature of urban culture in Lee's hometown of Brooklyn. You can say the film is really just an incitement, but dig a little deeper and you'll realize that it does not condone violence as much as it speaks on the circumstances of what could lead to violence. Alongside having hilarious character banter and an exuberant film-making stance, the film manages to be powerful without inducing a moral ground. The people in this film are not perfect at all, but their feelings and emotions are what make them resonate with us as individuals. Remember, if you simply can't understand the way someone feels, what makes your outlook any better?",8.0,19 January 2019
Everyone Wants to Do the Right Thing,"In 1989, Spike Lee decided to release a joint that was a controversy causin', argument startin', extended fourth wall breakin' rant havin', public violence incitin', social commentary makin', moral question philosophizin', poetically stylized cultural snapshot of a story about a hot as hell day in a Brooklyn neighbourhood. Do the Right Thing follows a day in the life of pizza delivery man Mookie, played by writer, director, producer, and star Spike Lee, and all the neighbourhood regulars as the summer heat adds pressure to their already tense dynamics. Each of the characters are somewhat odd and unique, while still seeming familiar and relatable. Ossie Davis plays the loveable drunk, Da Mayor, who maintains a wholesome attitude and has several endearing moments of virtue throughout the film, serving as the strong, if not weathered, heart of the community. His attempts at winning the affection of Mother Sister (Ruby Dee) are persistent, but never cross the line of being inappropriate. His selfless and admittedly foolish reflex to do the right thing, such as when he saves a boy from being hit by a vehicle, gains him respect from Mother Sister and most of the community, with the exception of a young man who berates him as the cause of his own problems even as Da Mayor pleas that the man doesn't know what he's been through. Although certainly cruel, even this random angry young man believes that he is doing the right thing by explaining his views of homelessness and its causes. Whether morally commendable or not, all of the characters in Do the Right Thing are trying to do exactly that, even in acts of violence. Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) blasts Public Enemy wherever he goes, aggressively standing his ground against the power, while Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) more vocally fights for the black man's place on the wall of fame in his community. Is pizza shop-owner Sal (Danny Aiello) not also entitled to stand behind his own decisions about his business? When everyone feels compelled to take action against injustice, friction is inevitable, violence and destruction are often the result. There is a surreal moment halfway through the film when the characters directly address the camera with rants filled with racial slurs. This is one of the ways Spike Lee uses artistic techniques to tell the truth. It is in these moments of poetic realism that the film is able to evoke the climate of the culture at that time and highlight societal sentiment in an honest way. The two quotes at the end of the film from leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom X, who Smiley (Roger Guenveur Smith) has been parading photos of throughout the movie, articulate the paradox of violence and the struggle to do the right thing in the face of oppression. And as Samuel L. Jackson's Mister Señor Love Daddy would say, ""That's the double truth, Ruth.""",9.0,8 November 2019
Spike Lee and Do the Right Thing,"I just recently viewed Do The Rigth Thing, which is by Spike Lee. I thought that it was a mediocre motion picture. I felt that it was very controversial and saddening as to how the different races were treated in the film. The beginning of the film starts with a girl dancing for a long period of time. The dancing and music were very interesting, but I didn't understand the significance of it in regards to the film. The characters did a very good job with their parts and I thought that the music was also good. It was also different, but not in a negative way, how the film was based on only one day. Spike Lee was able to make a 120 minute movie out of one day's activities. The ending of the movie was saddening and left me with a bad feeling. I thought that this movie was good, but I don't think I would go out of my way to see it again.",5.0,31 March 2005
Perhaps controversial but great either way,"Do the Right Thing was an excellent movie. It was awesome, until the end, then it got frustrating. Why can't we all just get along? But it sends a good message and makes some good points. The actors were excellent and the plot and storyline were great.

Spike Lee did a great job filming the movie on one block in the city and creating the feel of a boiling hot summer day. Using orange paint to create the mise-en-scene of the stifling hot day work. The actors looked sweaty and uncomfortable in the heat and the whole set made the feeling of stifling and hot. The film was fast paced and had good editing. It ran smoothly and didn't really have a slow moment. Lee didn't go into too much detail nor did he give too much detail to give a bias. The temporal relationship was good and covered one day which was really cool how he covered one day in the movie. The music was great, especially Radio Rahim's boom box. Every time Rahim was on screen his boom box played Fight the Power which was perfect for the whole message of the movie. Another notable piece of camera-work was the closeup Lee used on his characters, especially with Radio Rahim and Sal in the end before the big riot.

This movie was excellent, great camera-work with a great controversial message that really put Lee under the microscope and scrutiny.",,16 December 2011

Fantastic Commentary,"""Do the Right Thing"" is a striking example of juxtaposition. Set on a colorful street with an almost silly premise, this film takes on very sobering themes. Many things in this film make it feel almost cartoonish, such as dramatic camera angles and zooms, but not in a bad way. The plot of this movie revolves around racism and bigotry within the inner-city, something that isn't often glamorized or put on the big screen.

""Do the Right Thing"" is a must watch for anyone wishing to better understand race relations. It reflects very real issues still present today, and the 80's setting still holds up.",9.0,11 May 2021
Spike Lee really did amazing job on this movie!,Do the Right Thing really surprised me by Spike Lee himself. The movie was released in 1989. Took place in the summer. Spike Lee plays the character dude Mookie. Works at Sal's delivers pizzas. Then there's Sal and his sons also Radio Raheem played by Bill Nunn. Blasts his boombox with the Fight the power song so funny. Bugging out He stole the movie trying to Get Sal and put Black people on his wall. Smiley special needs He was funny too. Also we see Martin Lawrence and the funny neighborhood group. Sal destroys Radio Raheem's boombox and towards the end of the movie all Hell breaks loose and Spike Lee throws trash can at Sal's window and burns down his place.. Soo crazy towards the end!

I loved it then and still do today.,"Straight from the opening theme of 'Fight the Power' by rap stars Public Enemy, you just know this is going to be a thrilling and dynamic drama from (the then) up and coming Spike Lee. The soundtrack in fact is it's main strength and at times carries the action but the story also contains some really well thought out characters (with maybe some over the top racial views). The whole premise of the film is to deal directly head on, with the racial hatred that boils under the surface. Sometimes there is love to.

The ending of the film is unsettling, and offers no resolution. This is a very good film that keeps you thinking all the way. If Spike thinks the ""right thing"" happens here, I disagree with him.

Lee's Masterpiece,"""So this is why people say Spike Lee is a great filmmaker; I can finally say I get it. Every film I've seen from Spike Lee (up until this film) has always come across so ridiculously heavy-handedly that I find myself gagging as he shoves messages down my throat. ""Do The Right Thing"" is the most natural feeling movie I've seen from Lee. It feels as if he's approaching the same topics he always addresses (racial tensions) but with far more subtlety; he does it almost perfectly- almost.

I loved this film, far more so than anything else I've ever seen from Lee, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to almost anyone... but again, Lee's own heavy handedness keeps me from giving this a perfect score. In the last ten minutes I felt as if Lee sabotages a ton of the work he does by undermining the themes he's worked so hard to develop and leaving us with two diametrically opposed views. I can tell Lee was angry about the state of affairs when he made this film (and he's still angry), but it seems to me that he's not one-hundred-percent certain where to channel that anger. This film cemented in my mind the voice Lee truly does have. I think if he could learn to tone things back, even a little bit, he could make a masterpiece, but unfortunately, as thirty years of films following this movie have shown us, Lee doesn't seem to want to tone it back.",9.0,15 November 2019
Be ready to be transported to 1980's Bed Stuy.,"As a white kid from South of Boston, I don't really have a lot of the same experiences as the characters in do the right thing. I saw this movie in high school for the first time almost 20 years ago, and it's stuck with me ever since. The characters, story and themes explored here stand the test of time, and are ironically more relevant now than they were when I first saw the film. Highly recommended, and the kind of movie I'll continue to rewatch over the coming years.",8.0,1 October 2021
"That is the quintessential truth, ruth","This is my favourite Spike Lee film. It's kind of laid back and comfy at first, with great atmosphere. You can really feel the heat, and the tensions gradually building. The ending is solid. Definitely recommended.",9.0,9 July 2019
This movie is heartwarming and police brutality,"Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing provides a great representation of a community that is filled with hatred and discrimination. Lee's perspectives regarding the issues that go on throughout this film are evident. This movie does an excellent job illustrating a theme of violence v. Non-violence because of the way it emphasizes some of the beliefs that come from two of our most influential civil rights leaders; Malcom X and Martin Luther King.

It is evident one of the reasons the film was wildly popular was because the main characters accurately symbolized real-world issues such as racism, prejudice, and ignorance. However, one of the few aspects that may make one uncomfortable while watching, is the aggressive filming style. Lee's directing did a good job in evoking strong reactions from his viewers by making parts of the movie unpleasant to watch. In fact, the close-up scenes are what made certain parts so jarring.

Do the right thing is a movie that demonstrates the struggles that are still relevant today. Violence vs. Non-violence is sprinkled throughout the movie and also emphasized in secondary characters like smiley. Overall, the movie is an entertaining watch that provides different perspectives on real world problems.",8.0,9 March 2023
The most 80s/90s film I know,"This film, released in 1989 just breathes that period in terms of music, clothes, hairstyles, visuals.

It is a well made film and was immensely important back then. But in all honesty...the film hasn't dated that well. Not in terms of visuals. And in terms of the narrative I believe there are quite some modern day films that tackle the subject of racism better than Do The Right Thing.",5.0,31 March 2022

One of the best,"Do the Right Thing is an interesting take on the clash of race and class that was prevalent in the 1980's. It does a lot of things right as it has interesting characters, a good plot, and a meaningful message. The various personalities and attitudes of the characters make for a fun watch and, although there are scenes that take it a little over the top, the film still manages to keep its serious tone. The neighborhood of Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn, one of the biggest cultural influences in New York, makes for the perfect setting of a film focused on how class and race can lead to division between different races and cultures. The choice of setting really helps to make this film what it is. Another interesting aspect of the film was the characters and throughout the film we see characters such as Buggin' out who, while colorful and animated, is still a character that presents a serious and meaningful issue. The message of race and class division and the violence and conflict that arises from this is prevalent throughout the film. The only gripe I have with this is that there are moments where I felt this message was shoved in my face. The blatant stereotypes, the exaggerated dialogue, and the darkly comical nature of some events can be off putting at times and it often felt like the film was yelling ""Look at me, look at me! See how different I am"". Although it's always possible that this tone was purposefully done and with the creative genius of Spike Lee I wouldn't doubt this. Overall, the film is a great watch and should be mandatory viewing for any film buff.",9.0,9 December 2019

Spike Lee's best day.,"This for me has to be Spike Lee's best film to date, normally I don't think he can direct p**s downwards and he like Quentin Tarantino should never act in their films, or anyone else's come to think of it., but with film he hit the right mark.

Being a Black English boy, I found this film a wake up call. From the opening music by Public Enemy, to the call for us all to `Do the right thing'.

When one looks at a film like this, with so many characters, you feel just as with Tennessee Williams play the main character is the heat. It controls everyone's actions. Like a thermometer when the heat is to much, something is going to blow and when it dose you know someone will die. The cast is just a joy to watch. It's good to see old timers (I mean that with the most respect) like real life husband and wife Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, up against the wonderful John Turturro. Danny Aiello has never been better and Rosie Perez has never been more sexier.

This is a film for every race, and like Spike Lee's Malcolm X, we all have to say I am black, I am white and I will `Do the right thing'",,22 March 2001
Do The Right Thing,,10.0,17 February 2020
"Spike Lee was born on March 20th, 1957","This film is probably Spike Lee's most definitive piece of work in cinema. It is arguably his best as well. This film helped revolutionize black cinema for the modern era of film, but what was really cool about Spike Lee, was he came in at a time, that still utilized classic filmmaking techniques. A bridge from old film directing theories to modern Hollywood story-telling. He is a true auteur and definitely can make an artistic movie. He makes this modern-day (1980s), film about life in a section of Brooklyn, where race tensions are a little high, the summer heat is at 100 and they need to coexist together, but Lee's style captures the color, shapes and composition, as if it was, West Side Story (1961).

As Samuel L. Jackson (Mr. Senor Love Daddy), does his radio show transmission from the center of town, the rest of the area goes about its daily business. Many brilliantly crafted characters are established along the way. Spike Lee takes the main role as Mookie, a pizza delivery guy, working at Sal's (Danny Aiello), Pizza, at the center of town. From here various other plot arcs unfold involving a wide-range of ethnic characters that live among the few blocks around the pizza place. While some are trying to keep the basic flow of life going, like love, family, responsibility and money, they also have to fight against the dark side of this urban city life. A side containing racial tensions, money woes, sobriety, territorial dominance and anger. Plus, the temperature is 100 degrees, which just drives up the irritable mood felt throughout the movie.

This symphony of cinema, about urban city life, is beautifully crafted, not only visually, but the song choices are perfect and the film flows nicely. This is totally the case with Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn), as he carries around his boom box, totally picking the perfect songs for the situation involved. Without giving anything away, this symphony rolls through a small summer boil into an inferno of anger, confusion and tragedy. Spike Lee captures a world full of color, his characters situated in artful compositions and clever situations made up for the talented cast.

Veteran actor Ossie Davis, plays Da Mayor, the old local drunk, who wanders the streets looking for redemption. Bill Nunn's Raheem, who is the boom box carrying, street intimidator, who's fighting the power. Rosie Perez as Mookie's girlfriend. John Turturro gives a convincingly, irritating performance as Pino, the agitating, thickheaded, racist son of Sal's. That just names a few of the great talents, that help make this film one of the best from the 1980s. It is a true representation of late 20th century filmmaking at its best.

review,"In a time where civil rights of African American people is, unfortunately, still being debated watching this movie is phenomenal. At a time of Ferguson, and Baltimore riots, we really see where this frustration and anger is coming from. Director, and leading actor, Spike Lee does a phenomenal job with this powerful movie. Do The Right Thing shows the life of Mookie, a young adult growing up in a largely black-populated neighborhood. He works for an Italian man at the local pizza shop. This film does an amazing job with dealing with racial slurs for every ethnicity. The lighting in the movie had an overall orange tint to it which helped show the hot summer days these city kids were handling. as well as the heat from the world around them. This film is an excellent one to see if there is ANY (it's sad that there is some from others...) hesitation on civil rights of African Americans. The dialogue in this film is so casual and quick that it's really like we're watching Mookie's life in action as it happens. The variation of characters is also really important. There was someone in this film that everyone could probably relate to or recognize format their own lives. overall this movie is phenomenal, and i highly recommend it to anyone and everyone (well maybe not younger kids due to the graphic language)",,3 May 2015
This should be shown in schools,A genius concept: the heat rises and so does the tensions in the neighborhood. Spike Lee and company execute the sense of heat and anger perfectly. The climax is explosive and still resonates today.,9.0,13 September 2021
A spectacular landmark for cinema,"Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing still serves as a timeless, quality social commentary on the concept of racism and repulsive attitudes in USA, to this day, 32 years later. Lee uses humour for a greater effect in order to keep the audience intrigued with this compelling piece of work.

The film follows a usual, yet extraordinary day of Mookie the pizza delivery man, living in a predominantly black neighbourhood of Brooklyn New York. The story's core focuses on Sal's famous Pizzeria. A pizza joint wherein Sal's sons face trouble and conflict, mainly due to one of the brother's racism.

Spike Lee creates an immaculate vibe which i've seen in very few other movies by immersing the films viewers in and taking them for a ride. From the dazzling dutch camera shots, to the vibrant and vivid cinematography used to bring it's viewers in for a unique experience, each and every actor delivers top notch performances.

In a way, the film has something in it for everyone, whether it be the vibe or the issues discussed at hand, it reminded me of a simpler time in my teenage years, hanging around with friends on a hot day, looking for a bite to eat, characters which stand out etc: The title itself 'Do the Right Thing' serves as a motif for the movie itself. It's easy to say it right? But when conflicts arise within groups of different people, emotions can cause turmoil in many different ways, as we can see through Mookie's perspective as the story progresses.

Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing is one of the most captivating films i've ever seen, as well as serving as a landmark for it's genre (representation, social class etc:) It still holds up exceptionally well today and presents scenarios as lightheartedly as possible, until when us viewers feel we have had enough, which is demonstrated through Mookie's perspective. Lee has masterfully crafted this movie in a way everyone can enjoy it. A movie you must see before you die.",9.0,21 December 2021
Heartbreaking masterpiece,"Thank you, Mr. Spike Lee, for this film and for your entire body of work.",10.0,27 June 2020
"Near masterpiece, obviously a very importat film","Do the right thing, because of its ending, the importance of the subject it deals with, how it deals with it and who it is treated by, leaves you when finished with the feeling of having seen a very important, extraordinary and extraordinarily good film.

The film is very important and extraordinary. But Spike Lee's undoubted talent gave me the feeling, after remembering the whole film, that he could have given us an even better one: he had the concept, the style, the skills, the crew. It's very good, yes, but there are aspects that I personally didn't find worked that well.

The film from the beginning puts you in the atmosphere of a Brooklyn street on a day of unbearable heat. Blacks, Asians, Italians coexist in the neighborhood, and the treatment is that of a light and endearing comedy. People argue a lot, yell, get angry, but it all seems like some kind of game, where nothing is taken too seriously...apparently.

The first problem is that obviously that street is a fantasy...because almost no one works there, almost no one wants to work... and almost no one needs to work, because it seems that they have enough money to live peacefully eating pizza, drinking beer and chatting while enjoying the sun, which seem to be the only concerns of its inhabitants. Was that the situation in Brooklyn?

Naturally, not all black residents spend the day on the street, or enjoy loitering forever, but the presence of this group, with a single exception, is not even inferred by omission: it simply seems that they do not exist. What we see is that only one Italian family and one Asian family work hard in the neighborhood.

The atmosphere of the film is therefore that of a laughing comedy, where the sense of humor is based on a burlesque look that shows characters that are mostly picaresque or infantilized.

Spike Lee's greatest ability seemed to me to be how he avoids two great temptations: trying to give importance to the film through the irruption of melodramatism (the scene of the boy about to be run over by the car pointed that way), or to gradually create a gradual increase in clearly evident tension through the introduction of dark or murky elements treated in a dramatic way.

But no, everything seems to remain stuck in a status quo of silly tensions, where there is a white police officer who is obviously racist but who nevertheless knows the neighborhood and knows how to deal perfectly with the environment (his behavior in front of the character in the luxury car is closer to the offenders than to the victim); where the Asian family lives happily secluded in their store, avoiding any communication that is not strictly commercial with the people of the neighborhood and concerned only with saving some money; where an Italian is fond of his pizza restaurant that has fed the neighborhood for decades; where arguments between Hispanics and blacks are based on who plays the music louder, where a somewhat stupid black guy tries to boycott the Italian restaurant but all his friends laugh at him; where the pizza delivery man is clever and obviously spends more work time than he should messing around... This comedy atmosphere is not broken even when the white policeman looks with obvious contempt at the lazy trio who spends the day drinking beer... Even the eldest son of the Italian family, the character of John Turturro, the most disagreeable of the movie, is idiotic enough not to be shown as a real threat, much more an object of ridicule than anything else.

So the genre is clearly comedy: on the hottest day of the year, if tensions rise, they do so in a comedy atmosphere, as if everything were going to end in a meringue pie battle in the purest slapstick style. .

Spike Lee simply injects brief intermissions in which he shows that deep down this is a time bomb: at a certain moment all the characters vent on camera insulting the neighbor.

Spike Lee's ability seems to be to me, as I say, in that we didn't quite realize that it was a pressure cooker, and suddenly barbarism is unleashed. A black boy is not allowed to enter the Italian restaurant with the music blaring, and another black boy is irritated with the owner of the Italian restaurant because he does not have pictures of black personalities on the wall, and the two together decide to pay a visit to the restaurant to confront the owner of the pizzeria. It's when they come in...that we're not so sure we're in that comedy mood, and that effect is masterfully created by Spike Lee. And a couple of minutes later there comes the tragically too well known moment.

What I didn't like?: Spike Lee sometimes tries to treat certain scenes in a more original way and ends up looking like a crappy parody of the nouvelle vague, some transitions between scenes seem a bit clumsy, and the characters of Mother Sister and Da Mayor are cloying stereotyped...In fact, all black characters have a nickname, and the director does not intend to give them more humanity and complexity than what nicknames give them.

Overall, a brilliant film, very important, but one that leaves us with the feeling that it could have been even better, that it had everything to be much better.",8.0,12 December 2022
Amazing Combination of Subject Matter and Comedy,"Truly a wonderful film from Spike Lee who wrote, produced, directed and starred in this film. With a great opening credit sequence with Rosie Perez (who plays Spike Lee's girlfriend Tina in the film) dancing (which she can certainly do!) to Public Enemy's ""Fight the Power"" which is played over the film many times. It is a story about racism and different races living closely together in the same neighbourhood. What I love about it though, is it is not force-fed onto you. That and it meshes so well with the comedy that is quite alive in this picture.

It is wonderfully filmed and the colours almost seem to bleed out of the screen. Also love the use of zooms and the position of the camera. Also some great dialogue as well. There are many great scenes in this film, but I really loved the scene where they are soaking in water in the streets due to how hot it is outside.

Essentially perfect, deftly illustrating everything about Spike Lee at his best: urgent, effortlessly shifting between comedy and drama or tragedy, shocking, daring, musical, shot with verve. If there's one thing that feels like it hasn't aged quite as well as it could have done it's that at times the first half of the film feels a bit like an adaptation of a stage play - but even that is really just that this a more focussed disciplined film then others of Lee's. That was so of the moment, and so prescient is the film's ultimate tragedy - and the proof that it remains essential viewing.",10.0,31 May 2024

It's a vibrant and contagious character study about classes, with no excess of stereotypes.

Is it a battle between good and evil? Between the oppressed and the oppressor? Or is it an eternal battle between the ruling class and everyone who does not belong to it?

Spike Lee gives to the viewers the opportunity to think and make their own opinions about what really moves the events of the story.

"Relevant and Powerful, but a bit Boring in some places","What this film does best is to effectively demonstrate how hate acts of the greatest magnitude, can come from very minor places and behaviors. This is epitomized by the riot scene. I also thought the ending was a very mature conclusion to Mooke and Sal's character arcs. The film's presentation created a scenario briming with personality. Another contrast which I quite enjoyed was the ambiguity of it's morality against an in your face kind of approach. It was a fitting homage to the two great men Spike quoted at the end. What it does wrong is to forever ruin Public Enemy, for me! Seriously, now, even though it's a movie filled with entertaining interactions throughout, I did feel the slow pacing during it's middle portion.

A groundbreaking film on race in America,"It's a drama set in the late 1980s on the hottest day of the year in Brooklyn, New York. It occurs in a neighborhood that is changing demographically and is now predominantly African American and Puerto Rican.

The film unfolds the day with a wide range of characters. Italian American Sal (Danny Aiello) has run a popular pizza parlor for 25 years in the neighborhood. His sons, Pino (John Turturro) and Vito (Richard Edson), work with him. Their local delivery guy is Mookie (Spike Lee).

Mookie has a sister, Jade (Joie Lee), and a Puerto Rican girlfriend, Tina (Rosie Perez), with whom he has a young son, Hector. Local characters include Mookie's friend, Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito), who resents that the pizzeria's ""Wall of Fame"" has only Italian Americans and no African Americans. Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) is a huge African American who constantly plays Public Enemy's ""Fight the Power"" on his boombox. The street characters all use the street language that you would expect.

Smiley (Roger Guenveur Smith) is a mentally-challenged man who tries to sell pictures of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X shaking hands. Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) is an older street presence with a generous spirit and alcohol problems. Mother Sister (Ruby Dee) is an older woman who watches all from her window. Finally, Mister Señor Love Daddy (Samuel L. Jackson) is a local DJ who broadcasts on FM in the local neighborhood and makes observations that ""are the truth, Ruth.""

As the day unfolds, the heat begins to impact relationships. White police officers intervene a couple of times. Then, tempers become short over relatively minor complaints. Finally, the evening ends with a riot, death, and destruction.

""Do the Right Thing"" is a groundbreaking film by an African American director. The Radio Raheem character anticipates racial events of recent years. In some ways, Smiley is the wisest voice on the block. Spike Lee's character is enigmatic--which probably accurately reflects the chaos of many racial incidents. Not everything is polished; this is Lee's third commercial film. But it's one every North American should see at least once.",9.0,27 December 2022
"A Crazy, Colourful Movie that is Bound to Make you Smile","Let me start by saying that this film is good, really good. The cast feature some great performances, the dialogue is fast and funny, some of the best ever put to screen and the music, colours and locations all jump out of the screen demanding your attention. As well as this the cinematography is stunning with some really creative uses of angles and light. This film has the special quality of being one that you feel you could watch again and again and never feel bored.

However, now that I've gotten my praise out of the way onto a negative, Spike Lee's performance. While he was a wizard behind the camera I did sometimes feel his presence in front of the camera was somewhat lacklustre, now maybe this was intentional but it feels like a lot of the over characters drown him out with their performances and it appears to me that he can't quite hold his own, on the plus side, I only really felt this towards the beginning of the film and as the movie went on he did improve. Apart from that small complaint though I loved this film, it drew me in to this way of life I'd never experienced and kept me there, entranced for two hours, an amazing watch and well worth your time.",8.0,20 June 2021
This is a movie that is hard to not love,"Do the Right Thing (1989) is a movie I recently rewatched on Delta during a flight. The storyline follows a neighborhood in Brooklyn during a very hot day one summer. It depicts the various people, nationalities, perceptions and frustrations of people in the city. As the day builds and tempers flare a spark ignites and the frustration spills into the streets. This movie is directed by and stars Spike Lee (She's Gotta Have It) and Ossie Davis (Bubba Ho-tep), Danny Aiello (Leon: The Professional), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), John Turturro (Miller's Crossing), Robin Harris (House Party) and Martin Lawrence (Bad Boys). The storyline for this is so intricate with fantastic neighborhood depictions, character development and interactions, attire and writing. The dialogue throughout this movie was so compelling and well done. The intensity with sprinkles of humor was well depicted and the cinematography made you feel like you were there and could easily relate. There's some great analogies in this and the race war with snaps back and forth was so unique and well integrated. This is a movie that is hard to not love and relate to regardless of race or upbringing. The struggle was real. Really love this movie and strongly recommend it. This is another easy 10/10.",10.0,14 July 2021
Film hasn't held up very well in my mind,"I saw this movie when it first came out, and remember thinking how good it was. I saw it again today, and realized that while the themes it tackles are important, it really isn't as great a film as I remembered. Filled with stereotypes (despite places in the film that seem to be mocking how people stereotype one another), the dialogue is stiff, unnatural, and again, like someone's impression of stereotypes of Brooklyn street slang. Most of the performances consist of various people screaming bad lines at one another. I really wish this was the movie I thought I saw in 1989.",5.0,8 July 2017
Always 'do the right thing',"And so says the great Ossie Davis in a memorable scene of mentoring with Spike Lee in the remarkable ""Do the Right Thing"".

Spike Lee's first major studio film from 1989 is a reminder that great cinema is hard to come by.

Ten years after its release, I'm reminded of the entire summer of 1989 when controversy over the films final 20 minutes flared and outraged many groups. Many of those groups under-went protests over the films heated racial over-tones.

And yet, if the film were to be released in the summer of 1999, those same feelings would be at the forefront of most topical discussions. The world has changed very little from 1989.

So goes the underlying point to Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"". A film that, if you ask me, is meant to show that there is no way that different races and cultures can ever be one without realizing the differences between them. This isn't the bad thing. The evil thing is saying half-heartedly that we're 'all one big happy family'. We are not. Not yet.

The performances in this film, though sometimes over the top, often are right down to earth, and the real truth that permeates everyday inner thoughts. Though here, they're displayed in brilliant dialogue by Lee.

The look of the picture is key, highly inspired by the great cinematographers like Haskell Wexler (who's 1969 film ""Medium Cool"" bears alot of the same tones that Lee's film brings to the screen). Ernest Dickerson's shots of vivid color as the hot day in New York wears on, put you right on the block and make you see the raging truth underneath this tightly rapped package.

""Do the Right Thing"" is one of the best films of the 1980's.",,13 May 1999
"Left me shaken, silent, and breathless!","For the first time, as part of my Uncle Jim's movie club, for which I was a special guest, I saw the movie they'd picked: Do the Right Thing, by Spike Lee. I enjoyed it so much, and the end, left me completely breathless!

Tis' the hottest day of summer in Brooklyn. And it has been said that extreme heat can do things to you not just on the outside, but on the inside too. Everyone in the city appears to have their own personal problems, and with the heat increasing, they eventually start to take their frustration and anger out on other unsuspecting people. Lots of the people have different racial stereotypes towards other people, a main character named Mookie is struggling in his pizza delivery job with the owner Sal, and Sal is firmly refusing to acknowledge and respect a customers wish of putting a few famous African Americans up on his ""Wall of Fame"", which also has lots of famous Italian people there. Even the soft smooth talking of Radio DJ, Senior Love Daddy won't be enough to calm the growing frustration of the Brooklyn citizens, for when night falls...the volcano explodes! The ultimate climax, and ending, left me totally breathless, sad, but still hopeful. I had so many feelings just rushing through me as I saw what played out in the big climax, and when the credits rolled, I couldn't help but feel hopeful for the future of the town, hoping that the people of Brooklyn would not let their anger and hatred control them, come next super hot day. Said Martin Luther King: ""Darkness cannot destroy darkness. Only light can do that. Hatred cannot destroy hatred. Only love can do that."" My Mother had told me about Do the Right Thing: ""I think everyone should see that movie."" And I'm extremely glad that I did see it. I'd been planning to for a few years now, ever since hearing about it, and I saw the perfect opportunity when my Uncle Jim mentioned he and his movie club had picked this movie to see. I was able to give my own special opinions to the group as we met to discuss.

Do the Right Thing has made me feel such deep feelings and emotions, and it certainly will do the same to you. I definitely recommend it!",9.0,28 May 2023
Do the right thing...watch Do the Right Thing,"Do the Right Thing (1989) was produced, written, and directed by Spike Lee. The film's cinematography was done by Ernest Dickerson, was edited by Barry Alexander Brown, and was scored by Bill Lee. The film stars Spike Lee, Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Rosie Perez, John Turturro, and Bill Nunn (Samuel L. Jackson also shines in the role of Mister Señor Love Daddy). Do the Right Thing received an Academy Award nomination for best screenplay, and Danny Aiello was nominated for best actor in a supporting role. The film is widely considered to be a seminal work in examining race relations and racial tensions within the United States, and the consequences of police brutality.

The plot of Do the Right Thing takes place over the course of the hottest day of the summer in a predominantly black Brooklyn neighborhood, centering around an Italian-American owned pizza parlor. The audience watches the racial dynamics amongst the neighborhood's various groups - African Americans, Italian-Americans, Koreans, and Caucasians -- build over the course of the film. These tensions eventually reach a boiling point, and the ensuing chaos (which will not be discussed due to massive spoilers), serves as a powerful social and political commentary. Over thirty years after its release, watching Do the Right Thing is frighteningly similar to the horrific violence enacted against unarmed black individuals practically every single day in the United States. Despite the graphic brutality of Do the Right Thing, the reality of this violence is even worse than what is able to be shown on screen. When compared to the other films in the module, Napoleon Dynamite and The Great Dictator, Do the Right Thing is by far the most striking in terms of its current relevance, as the violence shown mirrors many current news stories. Spike Lee also dedicated the film to the families of six black individuals, five of whom were killed by the police.

There are many cinematic devices that cause Do the Right Thing to stand out from other dark comedy-dramas, especially in terms of the film's use of intense camera angles (a hallmark of Lee's filmmaking). Throughout the film, Lee uses different types of high and low camera angles in order to explore the various power imbalances amongst the characters. Additionally, he also utilizes cinematic Dutch angle shots, which have the effect of being disorienting for the viewer. These shots become more pronounced as the film progresses, which emphasizes the spiraling chaos of the storyline.

This film is incredibly important viewing, especially considering the racial reckoning that has been taking place in the U. S. within the last few years. I would recommend Do the Right Thing, with the caveat that it is unbelievably difficult to watch at points due to the realistic depiction of racial violence, especially if police brutality is emotionally triggering for the individual viewer. However, if one is looking for a more lighthearted comedy, I would suggest another film in this module - Napoleon Dynamite.",8.0,6 October 2021
Excessive victim mentality,"""Do The Right Thing"" directed by Spike Lee, is a socially conscious film set in Brooklyn, delving into the racial issues ingrained in American society through the lives of various characters.

It delivers a potent impact and message. It does not just relate racism issues, it shows the weakest point of humans. Despite being filmed over three decades ago, its portrayal of an enduring cycle of racism and hatred remains strikingly relevant today. Everyone has their own ""Right Thing"", and it often leads to misunderstandings and conflicts. In our contemporary world, diversity is championed as a solution to many societal problems.

In addition, it seems that people of different races are hurting each other under the guise of diversity in this film. Personally, I empathize with the perspective of the black community depicted in such films. However, I feel that they have an excessive sense of victimhood of discrimination in this film. Just because life is hard doesn't mean it is okay to attack others.

Nevertheless, ""Do The Right Thing"" stands out as an exceptional film. Its main theme is epitomized by the powerful anthem ""Fight the Power"". I highly recommend it to anyone seeking to understand the complexities of racism and American society.",8.0,3 June 2024

"A tick on the ""ORIGINAL"" box.","20 minutes into it and I had to pause the movie to check how old Spike Lee was when he made this, because he produced, directed, wrote, and stared in it and he looks like he is 20 years old in it. I checked and it turned out that he was 30-31 when he made it, immediately I was feeling a litter better about myself.

The film it's very different, it's very stylish and it really stands out from everything that I've seen. I loved the dialogue, it's by far the strongest aspect of the film, it feels smart, slick and above all real. What I also liked a lot are the new angles that they came up for putting the camera. I usually don't like when a director goes a little above his head and experiments with the camera movements and placements, but I liked the way they shot this film.

I really had to struggle for a moment in the end to not be mad with Spike for giving the police officers the perfect excuse for what they did, he really is a sneaky, frustrated guy for the way he wrote the mess that happened.

Overall, it is a great movie. I haven't seen much of Spike's work because he tends to make films that are politically heavy and I am not a fan of that particular sub-genre, anyway, now I can't wait for Da 5 Bloods.",9.0,5 June 2020

Spike Lee really came off as an auteur director for this film, and that really comes out with the unique editing and bold cinematography/lighting choices.

Spike Lee's Real Coming Out Party,"""Do the Right Thing"" wasn't Spike Lee's first movie but it was his true coming out party. ""School Daze"" and ""She's Gotta Have it"" were just him dipping his toes in the water. ""Do the Right Thing"" was him taking the dive to sink or swim.

It was a different approach to racial matters at that time and one of the first to broach the topic of police brutality. Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) was choked out by the police two years before we'd see Rodney King beaten by police in Southern California, and 25 years--in a chilling case of déjà vu-- before we'd see Eric Garner choked to death by the NYPD.

I don't care for many of Spike Lee's movies (I don't like their style or script), but this one was a hit. For many of us, this was our first introduction to Samuel L. Jackson, Bill Nunn, John Turturro, Danny Aiello, and Giancarlo Esposito. It was an excellent cast and Lee's magnum opus.",8.0,12 February 2020
A Story About Community That Culminates in a Shocking Ending!,"I was shaken by the ending of Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing. It took me so long to finally watch the movie which is shameful given today's climate and recent events. My first Lee film was 1988's School Daze. While I could see the talent, I was not impressed quite frankly. His next film did the trick. Lee was in complete control of the story. He knew how he wanted his story to progress but held his cards close to the chest. The first half, while you can sense some simmering tensions, was about getting to know a group of people and their sense of community. It was about people living their everyday lives. A slow-build with some fine comedy moments sprinkled in Lee's script. Then, he laid down the hammer as racial violence comes into play. It is hard to believe the movie came out in 1989. Some sequences are eerily reminiscent of what is happening in today's world. It goes to show how far (or not) we came as a society.

I find it hilarious how Lee came up with the film's idea. Alfred Hitchcock Presents claimed that hot weather increases violent behavior. I can see that idea because I personally become more agitated if the weather is extremely hot. That combined with the 1986 Howard Beach racial incident and a police shooting allowed Lee to formulate his script. The film, when debuted at Cannes Festival, instantly became a controversial picture. Columnists stupidly claimed that the film will incite black people to riot. You can see why Lee was very frustrated by those comments. Despite being highly though of upon release, that stigma stayed with the film till present day. The final act is shocking, but it is just part of the power that came with the film.

Mostly, Lee's film is about a bunch of people living their lives in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant. On this particular Sunday, it is the hottest day of the summer. Sal Fragione (Danny Aiello) is the owner of a pizzeria and has worked at the store every day for 25 years. The neighborhood used to be Italian-Americans but became home to African Americans and Hispanics over the years. His son, Pino (John Turturro) is openly racist and wants to move the pizzeria out of the neighborhood. Sal does not want to leave as he feels his pizzeria is part of the community. Then there was the complaint. Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) inquires why there are no pictures of black people on the restaurant's wall...just white Italian Americans. Now frustration and anger lead to violence that will ultimately change lives. In addition, we meet people like Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) who is the community's everyman, Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) whose ""Fight the Power"" on the boombox defines his life, the disc jockey (Samuel L. Jackson) that provides the running commentary, and Mookie (Spike Lee) who delivers pizzas.

The ensemble cast is nothing short of excellent. Danny Aiello is the one with the most difficult role, and he plays it so well. The ending scene between his character and Mookie is a scene of acting brilliance...one that requires open-ended responses. This was not even Aiello's part to begin with. Lee lobbied hard for Robert De Niro, which would have been an excellent choice. Instead, Aiello delivered and received an Academy Award nomination in the process (one of the very few nominations and many people perceived as unfair). Everyone is great. Giancarlo Esposito as the local militant, Bill Nunn as a victim of injustice, and Rosie Perez makes her debut here (she did have a difficult time filming).

Given everything going on in the world, it is important that Do the Right Thing is seen. Thirty years later, this is even more relevant and topical than ever. Lee has always been known to show anger in his movies. You see that here, but there is also some love and hope. Lee created a community with different types of people which means different solutions to the problem whether its militant violence or peaceful pieties. Different people use different methods to react to one situation which escalated the powerful ending. As a New Yorker, I understand what the characters are going through. Gentrification has become a problem for the city. That is only scratching the surface, but that's an argument for another place and time. The movie itself is important, but it is well-made. It is beautifully shot by Ernest R. Dickerson who did a great job making the city look hotter than any desert. Lee created a movie that is confident and not afraid of any controversy. That is why people watch the film all these years later.

"""Wake Up""","Do the Right Thing (1989/Spike Lee) **** out of ****

Human nature is what comes to mind when I think of ""Do the Right Thing"". I've always wanted to see a film that perfectly shows how people's deep feelings and cruel intentions can be expressed through great amounts of pressure. And this is the concept of the very complex, yet very beautiful film: Do the Right Thing. It shows real people under pressure, and how they interact with one another, as the evils of their souls fidgets out of them, like fire ants running out of an ant hill as it is slowly destroyed by a little boy.

""Do the Right Thing"" is a day in the life of the residents of a city block in Brooklyn, on the hottest day of the year. They consist of a kaleidoscope of different characters and different nationalities. And as the day progresses, and the temperature rises, the racial tension grows between them, and by the end of the day, the inevitable culture clash happens. The ""hero"" of the film is Mookie (played by director Spike Lee), a delivery boy who works at the local pizzeria run by Sal (Danny Aiello in an Oscar nominated performance) and his two sons.

The great thing about this film is that all the characters are flawed, which can only add to the immense realism of the film. ""Do the Right Thing"" has many admirable qualities as well. The cast is top notch. Spike Lee and Danny Aiello really carry the film, and they get great support from the two old pros Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, as well as many now-famous celebrities that owe a lot of their success to this film. The film helps to introduce such now well known stars as Samuel L. Jackson, Martin Lawrence, and John Turturro. It contains many odd camera angles and scenes where characters talk directly to the camera, all of which are elements that Spike Lee is now famous for. The film's odd mix of a jazzy score, to a soundtrack by 'Public Enemy', is striking.

The sad thing about this film is that it is often misunderstood, and sometimes considered anti-white. This is not the case. Nearly every nationality is depicted, and all have their flaws. Another element of the film that is also misunderstood and controversial, is the riot scene near the end of the picture. It is hard to explain it without spoiling it, but I will say that in the end, Mookie did the right thing.

""Do the Right Thing"" is a groundbreaking cinematic experience that should not be missed. Unfortunately, this is easily the most under-appreciated films of all time, and easily the best film of the 80's. For such a bad decade of films, this one closed it with a bang.

The movie point is to show how other groups look at other groups differently. The movie really show's you how it was to live back in 80's and a lot has changed since then.

Fight the power,"For the biggest part of it this film seems to be a parody of the life of African-Americans in NYC and Spike Lee uses a lot of stereotypes (the black guy who wants pictures of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X on the wall, the Koreans who don't speak english, John Torturro as the racist pizzeria owner) that don't add much to the story, but the climactic ending makes everything else in this film worth-watching. Spike Lee shows us in a brilliant way how blind hatred can destroy everyone's life. The tragic fate of Radio-Rahim and the fear in the eyes of the Korean grocer when he tries to explain to the angry crowd that he's not white are two of the strongest moments in any film I have seen. Two of the most memorable performances come from two veteran actors Danny Aielo (the italian-american pizzeria owner and Spike Lee's employer) and Ossie Davis (as da Mayor, a drunkard who tries to keep things in order in a neighboorhood where hatred is growing everyday). Spike Lee has matured a lot as his latest films have shown us, but ""Do the right thing"" is probably the most powerful work of this very emotional film-maker who manages to put a lot of his emotions and his energy in his films.",,14 June 2003

The movie has some hilarious moments (including anything said by the three old guys on the street corner), but more than anything, it's a portrait of racial relations and different peoples' attitudes toward it. Much ink has been spilled over the apathetic, messy ending, but I feel that it's probably just Spike's way of showing us that there are no easy answers. The cinematography (by Lee mainstay Ernest Dickerson) is vivid and mesmerizing, and set a standard for many films that would follow. The acting is nothing short of superb, with electrifying performances by Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis and the extremely underrated Giancarlo Esposito. Unthinkably, this movie received no Oscars (if I'm not mistaken). Ignore the Academy and rent this masterpiece.",,28 February 2000

Spike Lee's Greatest,,,19 December 2012
Racial tension/racial stereotypes,"The problem of racial tension is one of those problems that nobody has a solution for but which also just won't go away. All people, being predisposed towards judgment and classification, struggle to imagine a world that is colorless either in equality or inequality, but in equality making sure to preserve color. Whitewash everything so you get every color put together but none stands out, or whitewash everything so that no color remains at all.

Spike Lee focuses most of his energies as a filmmaker into problems of racial tension, and in this, one of his truly breakout films, he analyzes the duality of violence and civic disobedience (and other dualities such as love/hate) and tries to show how they can or cannot be used. In the best of ""objective"" ways, the actually solution is open-ended and unclear: we are left with only the picture of Martin Luther King Jr shaking hands and grinning with Malcolm X, in the famous photo which is the only known one of the two activists together.

So what do we have to explore this theme with? Well, we have a radio DJ connecting everyone through media self-consciously, as most movies dealing with racial dilemmas tend to include; we have various stereotypes ranging from the old drunk to the ho to the AYE-tahl-lee-ins; and we have a main character named Mookie, played by Spike Lee himself, who is the only self-actualized person in the film and, as a result, is a pompous jerk.

Thus, while the heat rises (signifying increasing tension), we have all the fun and revelatory speculation of watching a bunch of stereotypes yell at each other, only occasionally taking a moment to let Mookie give in a word otherwise while he basically abuses them passive aggressively and always gets what he wants, which what he wants is unclear, all until it culminates in the most materialistic of the characters getting together and doing something really, really stupid.

Of course it's all very revealing of the state of social tension and the difficulties imposed by multivarious ethnic identities all conglomerated into a whole and attempting to find identity while cutting in to each other to ""fight the power"" on their way to self-destruction, and if you don't get that the first ten times the movie says it, it's all summed up in quotes at the end. Or it's just banal. I'm pretty sure most people think of this movie in terms of the former, so I'll just leave it at that. Have a nice day.

Pointless aggression and hateful.,"Do The Right Thing (1989) -

Quite frankly the opening credits where a woman ""Dances"" was dull and the song was very dated watching in 2023 and probably not even that entertaining back in 1989.

Right from the start there was a lot of shouting and noise and while I understood that it was meant to be a snapshot of 'A day in the life of. . .' it was all just a bit chaotic and bitty, certainly at the beginning, as the various characters were established and the scene set.

All the way through there was a lot of attitude and high spirits/passions and not the pleasant ones that I would enjoy seeing on film, it was all street talk and machismo, unnecessary behaviour with the intent of starting a fight which made it too obvious what was building, but all of their behaviour was so stupid and petty, including the police. No one came across as having any sense. There was no intelligent character to balance out the idiots.

I genuinely couldn't live in that world, it would drive me nuts with frustration, because the whole film was a stereotype that showed how awful everyone can be, especially when they are aggravated by the heat, their environment, etc.

Ultimately I thought that it was really pointless and the climax was pathetic human behaviour. I wished that I had turned it off right from the beginning as I had wanted to, but for some reason it appeared on two of my films to watch lists, so I assumed that it would get better.

I also thought that it should have finished with Smiley's photo on the wall, because it really was too long already. It didn't need any of the epilogues for the various characters and would have been cleaner without them. It just seemed to rub salt in to the wounds for the poor viewer who had to watch it and for the characters too.

Because of all the hate and aggression in the film it was hard to see what was cute about it, if anything. The three chaps chatting on the corner could have been something fun and clever if they had been better used, maybe as a neutral and wise monkey type party to balance things out a bit more and I couldn't tell you if any of the cast were that good in their roles, because anyone can shout and scream.

Smiley (Roger Guenveur Smith) was really the only interesting character and if they had perhaps done everything from his perspective, intertwining the story around his interactions, it might have made it a bit more worthwhile for me.

Overall they made a farce of a message that quite honestly I have never really seen done well. Racism films never get the point across without showing up everyone involved. There has never been an attitude of positive inclusion depicted on film that I have seen. I hate all these films about gangs and street violence, drugs and often murder - 'Goodfellas' (1990), 'Boyz In The Hood' (1991) and many more. None of them promote a healthy and happy life of a good world to aspire to be a part of. This film certainly doesn't do that either. The subtle suggestion that the Italian man, Sal (Danny Aiello) chose that neighbourhood to deliberately try to integrate, if he even did, was lost with his temper pushed to boiling point and the other characters obnoxious behaviour that would make anyone reach for the baseball bat under the counter.

Very Good Plot and Message,,,11 December 2011
What's so great about it?!,"First of all , what the heck is soooo great about all the crap that goes on in the movie? First of all, Radio is a bully trying to make EVERYBODY listen to his music no matter what and then to go into another persons place of work and have that music blasting, the owner has a right to do what ever he wants. Then the part about wanting to make an Italian place put up pictures of African American people, that is stupid. They were the ones who actually started the fighting. Flip it around, it just wouldn't happen if Italians wanted to put up a picture of Sly in a soul food place. Now, the police DID go TOO far with the choke hold and kill Radio. But to do ALL that damage over something that those two started, was stupid. Also, the two quotes at the end do nothing for the actions taken place in the movie, I agree with the quotes, but it sure wasn't displayed in the movie, unless that's what it's all about, DOING THE RIGHT THING, which the rioting and bullying of Radio, and all that crap is supposed to say DON""T DO WHAT IS IN THE MOVIE, DO THE RIGHT THING.",5.0,17 June 2005
Classic,"This film is always a must in most film classes and you can see why. Visually and symbolically stunning, this film tackles some difficult social/political subjects that most directors of any race wouldn't touch. That's what makes Lee fearless. He just don't give a damn. This man went through such crap to get this movie made, it was unreal. Of course, the big guns didn't want to have anything to do with this ""controversial"" movie, but it's what the public needed. America has issues with being told what's wrong with it. Instead, they want lies fed to them daily or however often they watch movies instead of realizing the crap that they perpetuate. Movies support stereotypes, ideologies, and the majority. Lee's film shot all of those in the foot with his directing and acting. Apparently, people just want to be fed fantasy and not truth and reality beyond some filtered news medium. ""Movies are about escape"", such utter crap! What the hell are we doing in life that's so dreary that we need to be lied to in order to escape? We'd rather be lazy and not do anything about racism, sexism, the whole gamut. Instead, we say that's depressing. We aren't doing enough in real life to know what's going on there. What you think you know is also a bunch of lies, so I think it's time movies show truth. There aren't that many out there getting props, so let them live movie studios. It's not always about money! You won't shut down if one movie goes bad. It's scary to think that 10 companies own all the tv stations and movie companies in Hollywood...10. We need people who think outside the box. This film supports that. You can feel the heat and tension throughout the neighborhood. The racial slur montage was amazing. It brought to light the hatred, misunderstandings, and hurts of the day. The acting was so natural, that I felt they were talking to me, or I was listening in on a convo at the hairshop or walking down the street, Excellent movie.",,5 April 2004
Almost got low vote,"Well I finally saw this movie. At first I was not at all impressed by it. It just seemed another race war instead of what it was really saying. It was trying to show all these different cultures interacting in a predominantly black neighborhood. In the end I have to say the acting was great and that gave this movie a few extra points.

Some people would say that I just don't like Spike Lee films but I do. I think some of his more recent films are great. Yes I understand what he is trying to tell everyone in his films. To me this was just not one of his best and I can see by others comments I am one of the few. Well I still gave the film a decent vote do to the great actors who performed well

Controversial,"Calling this film controversial is a gross understatement. Even now, in this age this movie can be relevant, what with Baltimore Riots. The film is overall good, Spike Lee's character an interesting one. However,the question of Did Mookie (Lee's character) Do the Right Thing? is the main idea of the movie. The right thing is referring to Mookie throwing the trash can through the restaurants window. I, myself, do not believe Mookie did the right circumstances. The events leading up to it were not one person in particular's fault. I just think that violence is rarely, if ever, the answer. At the end of the movie, before the credits, there were 2 quotes, one from Martin Luther King Jr. and one from Malcolm X. I liked the MLK one more though.",5.0,13 May 2015

controversial ending a commentary on African-American attitudes,"This is easily Spike Lee's greatest. Do The Right Thing is funny, vivid, compelling, provacotive and enraging. The ending is easily the fierciest moment of cinema found anywhere but isn't really a celebration of African-American upheaval. Just look to the credits for quotes from Malcolm X and Martin Luther King which advocate a movement towards peace. Lee's film is everything that entertainment should be. It's informative, insightful and flows effectively from scene to scene. It is also what great art should be . . . an honest reflection of society. Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis are charming.",,4 July 1999
Analysis for Do the Right Thing (1989),"This film has reached a new low for me, because there was a lot of material that I really disliked. I knew that this film was not going to be very good when I saw the first ten minutes. First off, there was way too much profanity in it. I am not used to watching films that include this type of stuff. In terms of the characters, the actors did their characters nicely, but I hated the way they kept using bad behavior towards each other. But the worst thing about this film was when I saw some complete nudity in one of the screen shots. The nudity was so bad that it made me cover my eyes and say, ""I can't watch!"" If that isn't enough, I also disliked the big fight scene where the characters got into a brawl after Radio Raheem's radio got destroyed. However, there are some good parts, like the non-transparency shots of the African Americans sitting on their chairs and the shots going through a window. Overall, this is one film that I would never want to watch again.",5.0,7 May 2014
Spike Lee at his best...,"Do the Right thing is without a doubt Spike Lee's greatest film to date. John Turturro, Danny Aiello, Richard Edson, Giancarlo Esposito and Ozzie Davis are all superb. The only flaw was Spike Lee who has too big a role and plays it with too little experience (as an actor) and gets overshadowed in every scene. The dialogue between the Italian and African Americans is superb, Lee has certainly captured the mindset of many different nationalities living/working together in a small suburb. If you have not rented this movie, do so. If you're a fan of comedy, drama or even great cinema watch this movie. It certainly will be worth your time.",,14 January 1999
Do the right thing,I think the movie was alright. It did a good job showing the controversy of the time and showing the tension between different races that eventually lead to trouble after trying to keep it to themselves. I don't think the acting was that good though. It was really interesting seeing the tension between the all the characters build up in different ways. But Honestly I can say this was one of my favorite movies. The characters were a little to out there and ridiculous for my taste. I think that the movie gives a bad name to Spike Lee because it makes him out as a complete racist. Its still an important movie to see that represents a new step in the history of American Cinema but it still isn't my favorite.,5.0,19 December 2012

Do the Wrong Thing,"This movie does the wrong thing. It is supposed contrived from real events. The only thing is that it does nothing to help the real world. It is still another over indulgent Spike with nothing else to do but touch upon the racial issues with a twisted hateful view passed off as art. It took him two weeks to write the script which is quite evident by the way it comes off.The last scene is purely a waste of time. The over use of bad language is also a problem. This movie is what happens when a group of talented actors buy into the rantings of a 7th grade talent of a writer director such as he. The only redeeming value of this movie is the fact that the actors did a good job with a bad thing. Still, this is one of his better attempts at making a movie. I especially liked seeing Rosie Perez play his love interest. I don't know why Spike thinks this brand of anti religion and anti peace preaching has helped to bring society together.He needs to do the right thing.",5.0,4 June 2007

insightful but not great,"This movie received a lot of hype the year it came out. For both the on screen and off screen personality and viewpoints of writer / director Spike Lee.

To me this is not Spike's best work. His best work was Malcom X and Clockers both were movies where he mostly stayed behind the camera.

The movie touches on lots of stereotype opinions. And it is quite courageous in that it shows some of the good and bad stereotypes of African Americans, Italian Americans, Asians and average white guys.

What it is missing is a more stable storyline. And severely lacking in a closure at the end of the movie. I do not know of any people who have ever watched this twice.",5.0,25 February 2007

My answer was simple stand up for you who are and what you believe in which is shown in many different times during the movie, the two brothers always arguing, the girlfriend with the child, even Mookie at some points thinks about what others around him are saying. But there is always that one second where you decide what and if you are going to do something that may change the way people see you and the way that you see your self and at the end of the movie it shows that.",,11 December 2011

Best Movie Since Raging Bull,"Although most of Spike Lee's films are flawed in one way or another, DO THE RIGHT THING seems to be perfect. I love how we are given a whole slew of distinct characters, my favorite being Senor Love Daddy. Although this film is about race, and most of the characters are black, this movie does not seem to side with the blacks or any other race. It simply provides us with an essay on our great nation's greatest problem. So, what do you think? Did Mookie do the right thing???",,17 May 2002
A neighborhood of different races do the best to suppress their racism until it results in violence in the end.,"I understand the powerful message embedded in the film, but I thought it was absolutely terrible. The acting was so horrible i found that I could only focus on the unbeleivablity of it rather than the actual movie. I was bored until the very end, and even then I thought they dragged on the ending a little too long. It was unlike any movie I had seen before, which is probably why some people love it. There were certain camera shots that were interesting, the upward views of the characters especially. I found certain scenes to be unnecessary (the sexual scene with Mookie and his girlfriend, the three men sitting on the side of the road having pointless conversation). Some scenes just didn't even contribute to the movie's ""message"". I liked Sal's character, I thought it brought an interesting contrast to the otherwise ethnocentrist array of characters.",3.0,8 December 2012
Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing is a eye-opening experience that,"Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing is a eye-opening experience that delivers a strong message about race relations in a vividly powerful way. I loved the move when I saw it back in the 80's, after learning more about films then watching it more recently I have a better insight about different aspects of the movie. I feel that the theme of ""Do the Right Thing"" is that everyone has a valid point of view of how they view life, but there are not many who are willing to compromise to do the right thing, as Da Mayor(Ossie Davis) was trying to teach Mookie. I feel that the movie has a theme song as well ""Fight the Power"" (Public Enemy), due to the song being played several times throughout the movie.

The cinematography had extreme angles and vivid color scheme perfectly contribute to the feeling of heat. At the start of the movie the angles, sound effects, and music gave me the feel that I was there hot on set. From Tina(Rosie Perez) Mookies girl friend dipping her head into the bucket of ice water, to Jade(Joie Lee) Mookies sister taking a cold shower, to the Puerto Ricans opening beer cans, to Cee(Martin Lawrence) and friend turning on the fire hydrant.

The movie's setting and background is a sweltering hot summer day in Brooklyn. The movie is centered around Sal's Famous Pizzeria, which is the only white owned business in the neighborhood, and one of three business that dominate the block in the movie. The other two are a store front radio station, where narratives from disc jockey Mister Senor Love Daddy(Samuel L. Jackson), and a convenience store owned by a Korean Couple. There Pizzeria owners Sal(Danny Arello) his two sons Vito(Richard Edson), and Pino(John Turturro), and Mookie(Spike Lee) the black delivery guy. The movie began with everyone in the neighborhood going about their usual daily routines, but as the day went on the temperature was not the only thing that began to rise.

Tensions began to rise when Buggin Out(Giancarlo Esposito) made issue with the fact that Sal's Famous Pizzeria doesn't have pictures of ""brothas"" on the wall along with all the white celebrities, because he feels that blacks are the main patrons for Sal's. Buggin Out decided to boycott Sal's Pizzeria. The movie reached it's climate when Radio Raheem(Bill Nunn) was killed by the police.

In conclusion I feel that if only every one would have put aside their own point of views and differences no one would have gotten hurt or died.",,10 December 2011

An Essential Spike Lee Joint,"Covering a hot summer day in a small American neighbourhood composed primarily of African-Americans, Do the Right Thing packs as much style as it is brimming with substance and is a vexing & vibrant portrait of race relations in modern America that comments on everyday racism, hate, bigotry, disparity & hostility through the lens of both despair & agony.

Written, produced & directed by Spike Lee, the story takes ample time to give us an authentic sense of the community residing in the depicted streets, and acquaints us with several colourful characters before it all converges towards the explosive finale that always felt inevitable. Lee directs the film with tact & restraint, keeping a cap on its volatile premise for as long as possible.

Lee's approach exhibits no shortage of style as evident in the versatile camerawork & character interactions, and his input in front of the camera is just as neat. The film steadily builds towards its third act with an undercurrent of simmering tension until it all boils over the rim & spills on the surface. Strong performances from the cast add more credibility to the plot with Danny Aiello being a clear standout.

Overall, Do the Right Thing is jam-packed with situations that could escalate into an all-out brawl at any given moment but by letting the racially charged unease to stack up till it nears its boiling point, Lee heightens our anticipation to a degree that makes the climax all the more powerful & hard-hitting. There's hardly anything controversial about it. It doesn't take any sides. It provides each character their own space. And it makes an essential plea for mutual understanding. In short, this Spike Lee joint is a definite recommend.",,1 June 2020
Stupid with no plot,"What a stupid movie. Some well known actors.

But the plot was all over the place. 45 minutes into the movie and I stopped watching.

Actually, I didn't think there was a plot to begin with.

Too much profanity. Way too much.

You would think that the writers could have tone down with the profanity. Every single sentence, someone would drop the mf-word. It almost seemed like that was the only word the characters knew throughout the entire movie.

I am completely disappointed. I've heard of Spike Lee, but this movie was horrendous.

A lot of racial insults, but that did not bother me. There is a scene where some of the characters spent a good 5 minutes exchanging racial insults with bad words and yelling. Pointless.

Yep. A total waste of my time.",1.0,3 February 2024
"Hey Sal! ""How come yo ain't got no brothers on the wall""???","Yes, it is a classic. Having now secured the Criterion collection DVD version from the US direct, I can now appreciate the true quality of it all. Mookie (Lee) is a passive but opinionated pizza delivery boy, working at Sal's Famous (Sal played magnificently by Aiello)at the end of the block. The film delivers a slice of real life on a 24 hour deathly hot NYC day. Senior Mr Love Daddy at 'We Love Radio'opens the event and, sets the scene as we then plough through an odyssey of love, lies, misunderstandings, hate and humour.

No-one surely expected a full scale riot and death to result from the early banter???

My favourite scene? Easy: ""Hey, don't be f***in with the water - this car's an antique"".....When the car and driver get soaked he responds to the NYPD's invitation to file a compliant with ""Yeah, I wanna file a complaint, I want them buried UNDER the jail"".

One of my favorites,"This is one of my favorite movies because it shows how racism and discrimination against others will cause nothing but hatred which eventually leads to violence. In my opinion I think every one should have done the right thing and communicated with each other and be accepting towards one another and then all the violence and hatred in the end could have been prevented. Mooki's character seemed to teeter in the middle of everybody because he was black and everyone feels that he should be supporting his black ""brothers"" but he works for Sal's pizza place who everyone seems to antagonize because he refuses to put any black people on his wall of fame. In the end Mooki sided with everyone else and started the sabotage of Sal's business however everything could have been prevented if there was proper communication and understanding. Everyone thought Sal was being harsh because he claimed that it was his restaurant and he could put whoever he wanted on his wall of fame; which is true because they all so happened to be Italian Americans however everyone took it harshly and offensively. It just goes to show that proper communication is key amongst everyone. I also liked Spike Lee's use of the reddish yellowish lighting that was used throughout the whole film, it was meant to portray the heat and it id very well because throughout the whole movie everyone was complaining about the heat. I also enjoyed the use of different camera angles and the close up shots of the characters.",,1 May 2013

A brutal look at inner city life,"With a cast consisting of some of the best character actors in Holly- wood (Danny Aiello, Giancarlo Esposito, Ossie Davis, and Bill Nunn)

and dialogue only found in the roughest parts of town, DO THE RIGHT THING is a stunning film about how life can take an upside down turn when racism rears its ugly head. Spike Lee leads the cast (not to

mention directs the movie) as Mookie, a soft-spoken black pizza

delivery boy who works for Sal (Danny Aiello), who owns the pizzaeria. What seemed like an regular day of work turns into a firestorm of racial conflict as two acquaintances of Mookie's (Esposito and Nunn)

becomes outraged at Sal's subtle racism towards African-Americans. Lee directed DO THE RIGHT THING with a rugged view of urban life,

I know I did the right thing,"This movie was outstanding, amazing, thrilling, chilling, gripping, funny, and any other word you can think of. This is the first Spike Lee movie I have ever seen, and it has me hooked. All of the confrontations and contrasts. The verbal and physical blows! The Citizen Kane-esque cinematography! I walked into this movie not really knowing what it was about and I walked out stunned. This is the kind of movie that should be made these days not awful wastes of time like ""Wing Commander"". I will watch this movie many more times. It is a classic!",,15 March 1999
Spike Lee's best to date,"I just watched this movie again for the first time since I originally saw it in 1989, the year it came out. It holds up very well, although I now consider it a very good rather than a great movie, as I did the first time.

Spike Lee's movies are always political/issue-oriented in their tone, but in most of his films after this one, the characters tend to speechify and debate as if they were panelists on ""Nightline."" This remains the film in which Lee most artfully blends issues into the narrative mix. And boy do we get a cornucopia of inner-city issues: racism (of course),police brutality, absentee fathers, gentrification, and even a taste of that ""jungle fever"" to which Lee would eventually devote an entire film.

All of this comes to light on a summer day of blazing temperatures and tempers on a racially diverse street in Brooklyn. The film climaxes in a series of questionable split-second actions and reactions to the mounting tensions of the day. The ultimate point of the movie is to challenge the viewer to evaluate these actions not only from the viewer's own perspective, but from the perspective of the characters involved. Mission accomplished. Lee succeeds in portraying the values, priorities, and prejudices of a whole community through glimpses at their lives in a single day.

The controversy that met the film upon its release focused on what happens in the movie, as if by portraying certain actions, Lee was advocating the same. This is a very short-sighted view that ignores the first 9/10 of the movie in which we see the flaws of everyone concerned, and thus should realize that anything they ultimately do must be weighed in light of what we know about them.

What was really revolutionary about this film is that for the first time, racism and other serious issues that blacks face were not addressed in the past with blacks mostly quiet and obedient in the background with whites as their champions/saviors like ""Glory,"" or ""Mississippi Burning"" or in the present with white protagonists like ""Colors."" This time, the time and setting was here and now and black people were upfront and spoke for themselves. It's no wonder some feathers were ruffled. But many years later, most viewers should be able to see through the fog of these concerns and appreciate a very well-constructed, tense, and entertaining drama.",,25 May 2002
Do the Right Thing,"""Do the Right Thing"" starring Spike Lee, Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, and Ruby Dee was a great film for many reasons. This movie is really powerful because it shows that everybody should be equal no matter what race you are. Some people may have found it a little disturbing but the movie was phenomenal.

Mookie made the right choice in the end because it all had to stop. I believe he could of handled it in a better way and not with violence but he had to do what was right. The story line behind this movie was special and it sends a powerful message to people. I really enjoyed this movie and I would highly recommend this movie to others.",,12 May 2015
Poetic! Brilliant! One of the best films I have ever seen!,"Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" is one of my most favorite films. It is one of my favorites because it has an amazing lesson for us as a society and as a culture of diverse people. One of the great musical artists, Marvin Gaye, wrote one of the most beautiful songs ever written! His song ""What's Going On"", brought up the same message Spike Lee's film does. Violence is not the answer! We are all created equal! And we should talk to people so we can find out more about ourselves. We are wonderful creations of God, and we have so much to share with other people. Love is the answer to these problems. Every scene in the film portrays these everyday people as amazing, interesting, wonderful people who have something to say to us! And the sadness of the film is how the tragic ending shows us how much we as a society refuse to listen and let our anger get the better of us! This is not only an anti-violence film, it is an anti-racism film. We as a society often blow people off as a nigger, white trash, and so on. ""Do the Right Thing"" lets us look deeper into these people's hearts and souls, and lets us realize not only how foolish we have been behaving, but how much wonder and beauty you can find in another human being. ""Do the Right Thing"" is not even about racism or violence. It's about humanity! And it shows us how precious we are as humans by forcing the horror and stupidity of racism and violence on us. This film shouldn't be recommended as entertainment or something good. This should be required viewing! It should be required because people have to know how stupid they have been behaving, and how easily they can change this world into a better place!",,2 May 1999

"Good concept, the execution is sorely lacking.","This of course is a well-known and highly-regarded movie and in its first 30 years I had never seen it. Now available on a Criterion release on DVD from my public library I watched it last night. I felt I needed to.

By way of very brief summary, I don't like it at all. Except for Ossie Davis, who goes by ""Da Mayor"" and is a very thoughtful, reasonable character, all the others are caricatures. They are always angry, they shout at each other, normal conversation is almost completely absent. The language is filthy, it seems Spike Lee's main vocabulary is ""Muther-F this"" and ""Muther-F that"", or just filling dialog with the ""F-word."" To the point that it just becomes noise and all meaning shuts down.

The concept is good, on a very hot day in Brooklyn, an area where whites, black, Asians, and police all must interact, bigotry and prejudice eventually gets the best of everybody and violence is the result. Hardly a novel concept but with the stellar cast Spike Lee accumulated this could have and should have been a much better movie. Instead most of it is tedious and tiresome.",,4 September 2019
Rascist trash designed to tear people a part,"Me and my husband finally caught up with this film after a reccomendation from Roger ""At the Movies"" Ebert. He falls all over himself saying what a great film this was. I was appalled at the language, the music and the violence and the way the non-black characters are played, like we're all about oppression. It also doesn't date well, the clothes are horrible, like stuff from years ago on MTV. I can't understand why Ebert likes this so much. I'll have a hard time trusting his word again. A picture like this is an incitement to violence so I'll leave you with this thought: to play a piano beautifully you have to have the white keys and the dark keys. Remember that.",,17 April 2004
The Inkblot of the Class-System,"It's truly amazing to see the way people react to this film. It's like an accident scene, and when giving their account to the cops, each witness sees something different. Everybody has an opinion on what the movie means, what the characters represented. But you're all wrong.

But even I'm not right about it. And that's the point. Your reaction to this movie reveals more about you than it does the film. For instance, the people who describe Radio Raheem as a ""thug"" and ""full of rage"", where do you get that? Cuz I don't see that at all, I see a big kid with a big box listening to a song he likes. I don't agree with all his actions or especially his logic, but it seems to not be able to see his humanity is a sign that a viewer is already defensive. But that's just me.

Others have theories based on the way the shots are composed. While there are established techniques like they describe, they seem to be unable to see past the conventions and into the way Spike is messing with the form, messing with our ideas of 'good' and 'bad'. Again, just my reaction.

Some others seem to think that Spike is being one-sided and saying that sometimes 'doing the right thing' means throwing a garbage can through a window and burning down somebody's business. somehow i got the impression that this was NOT the right thing to do, that the irony of the title is that even those of us who consciously try to be morally pure have a lotta trouble doing it in complex real life.",,11 June 2001
in the last 20 years...,"when i think back, i can't point out another film with as much possibility as dtrt, i can't think of a better film from the last 30 years. but wasn't ""the godfather"" made less than 30 years ago? yes. do the right thing is better. a clockwork orange? this is better. raging bull? this is better. but why? because of the truly challenging message of the film, the question that it asks: who is correct, who is ""the right thing""--malcolm or martin? if you watched this film with a careful eye, you would have seen metaphor upon metaphor, all representative of this question. first, there's vito and pino, two brothers. one is in favor of racial harmony, the other isn't. there's radio's love vs. hate monologue, and there's mookie's own conflict over what should be done (in the end, he chose malcolm). but this is not the sole reason to watch this film. it's a marvel to watch, and you'll be surprised by how similar it is to watching citizen kane for the first time. the low angle, high angle camera placement, the expressive mise-en-scene,and of course the brilliant dialogue. i actually compared spike lee to woody allen upon watching this for the first time, even though their filmmaking styles are nothing alike. but think about it. is there another filmmaker alive today who has starred in, written, and directed his own film with as much competency as these two?",,16 December 2001

Waltzing with Watts,"This has all the ups and downs of a young filmmaker committing to a personal vision. He wants that vision to be a bit like jazz or hip-hop, so it has energy and raw, street-wise instrumentation, it has the despair of your world being too small for dreams and the kind of sweltering intimacy that you don't need a reason for and just springs at you. That's all fine.

But, watching it now all the contrivance about it being real shows. The camera is jazzy but the world it riffs against feels curiously artificial and stagebound, like it's been adapted from a play instead from real streets. The people feel like tokens of eccentricity. The situations feel a lot of them set-up.

The contrivance is that all of this is somehow impartial. A more obvious view is that Lee making the film is taking a side.

The white man is the obnoxious guy in the fancy car that demands they turn off the fire hydrant. The white man is the cop who does. The white man runs business. Hell, even the Korean man runs business.

That's probably life somewhere in New York, or was then. Lee probably thought he was being evenhanded. He was just making Watts into a film.

So the frustrations are very probably real, but cinematically that is conveyed in a less than satisfying manner. Killer of Sheep of 10 years back worked its way around issues of cinematic formality by having at the helm a filmmaker who simply didn't know or didn't care a whole lot about other movies, so had no other aspiration than to capture life he knows. Truth felt unmediated. The problem here is an ambitious young guy who thinks he can translate that same life as Burnett's in terms of a few good movies he has seen, probably French (and Altman).

Think I'm waxing? The Nouvelle Vague ideal was that life is a movie, no deeper than just a set of images that you contrive to happen.

At the root of the film, is an angry young guy who wants images up on a wall that reflect him and reflect the world he knows and feels to be marginalized. It's an unreasonable demand, the way it's framed, that we simply can't wave off because we go on to spend time in this world where unreason is a systemic issue. This is much more provocatively framed in the finale as murder at the hands of a 'pig' cop and ensuing riots.

It's an early Dogville, a film of similarly inspired theatric artifice, in that case Brecht and laid out in the open, except this is an angry young guy's film so, yes, the people are violent, injustice is a given, but we can point the accusatory finger to the inhuman representative of a faceless, evil 'system'.

But it's simple-minded to rest there for film that wants to get at the bottom of things. Watts did not happen because of an arrest. It was the social heat that aggravated and this heat has systemic cause. Weather in this case does not arbitrarily fall from the sky.

On the end that illustrates this, we have the 'pig' cop who enforces the system and Da Mayor's soliloquy about starving children. Slim pickings. Clumsy storytelling. Here's the problem; we have Radio Raheem's love/hate bit, a really cool scene in Lee's head, but really nothing about this person. Where does the money for blimps and a boombox come from? What does he do? What does Buggin Out do when he's not fussing over his Air Jordans or pictures on a wall?

It's a reasonable accusation, anyway, but pop-superficial and reactionary in the way it's framed as much as political Godard of the 60's. There is merit in the sentiment but lost in angry phrasing.

And this is what happens with partisan mentality in general and sloganeering. The effect of the film is that it got people talking, which is a good start, but has provided only enough thread to split opinion. Because the systemic cause is simple-minded in the film, so not convincingly illustrated that the thing is broken on the level where it's being administered from, viewers feel compelled to pick sides on the street; it was Sal's or Buggin Out's fault. See, the angry young guy's brash temperament splits a broader community of bystanders/viewers. We don't leave this with one vision.

(It's a Marxist point that is muddled here and alienates; private business should operate on the same principles as a state, ergo the collective must be free to have a say on images that describe it.)

Doing a bit of research, I stumbled across this nice tidbit that is perhaps its own insight: Buggin Out was cast in AMC's Breaking Bad as the perfectly respectable/socially-conscious owner of a food chain who gives to charity (does the right thing), but on the side uses business as a cover for a lucrative drug-dealing network. Apparently, he went into business in 1989 as an immigrant (an outsider) and his life before that is shrouded in mystery.

Something to mull over in light of this film and social structures.",,18 July 2012

"Disappointing, a waste of talent, overrated","This is one of those films that has something to say, but never quite says it. It's a strange mix of very complex ideas with incredibly simplistic execution. Unfortunately, racial politics seem to to effect attitudes toward the film as much as they are addressed within it--there seems to be a great need to say good things when there really isn't that much that's good about it. The first thing I noticed about the movie was the use of stereotypes--they're all here: An Italian-American pizza parlor owner, who evidently harbors secret racist feelings while at the same time lusting after a young African-American woman. A lazy black delivery man (Mookie) who likes money but is more interested in having sex with his girlfriend than being a good worker. A hard working Korean who owns a convenience store in the bad neighborhood who is distrustful of his patrons. Add in a thuggish black who blasts Rap everywhere, a yuppie gentrifier, a racist Italian, brutal cops, Ossie Davis as a drunk, ne'er do wells who seem to roam around the neighborhood with no jobs but lots of time to riot, and a few old guys sitting on the corner doing nothing but complaining.

Perhaps the presence of all these stereotypes is supposed to get us to think about them, but unfortunately it tends to undermine the really quality acting by Aiello, Davis, Turturo and a number of others: Really top notch performances for characters who don't quite match the talents. There are sparks of really, really good writing--for instance the scene where Mookie talks to Turturo about the latter's racial attitudes, hilarious and substantive at the same time. But ultimately, the simplistic stereo types on the one hand -- which, had they come from another director, might be considered racist -- and the appropriate ambiguities of the plot on the other combine to make a sloppy mess of a movie without much direction. Had Spike Lee waited a little to become more seasoned as a director, such an ambitious project might have been brought off. He aimed high and so had a long way to fall.

Still, the two positive things mentioned: Great performances all around with a few really well written scenes are more than you get in some movies.",,13 April 2000
The best film ever about race,"The screenplay is phenomenal. The buildup is nuanced and sophisticated, and the result is a stunning 30-minute climax. The plot is wildly unpredictable, the dialogues are well-written, and character development is quite impressive given the number of characters. Spike Lee is probably the best black director of all time. The direction is suspenseful and economic. The ensemble cast give brilliant performances, particularly the one who plays Sal.

In a nutshell, this is a must-see for everyone.",,7 February 2019
delivers a swift punch to the gut,"Set in a culturally diverse but predominantly black neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, this thought-provoking film chronicles several characters and their simmering racial tensions during a scorching summer day, specifically those who frequent a local pizzeria run by a gruff Italian-American man who's lived there for nearly thirty years and refuses to close shop despite the underlying hostility of his surroundings. A tense and palpably real examination of race and bigotry with flavorful dialogue, colorful characters, volatile interactions, and a powerful climax. There's also plenty of fine performances, and some memorable early supporting roles for reputable actors like Samuel L. Jackson, Rosie Perez, and Martin Lawrence, among others. Intentionally unsettling, but contemplative and well-crafted as well. ***",,11 March 2019
Do the Right Thing,"I thought this movie to be very controversial and it asked a good question. I think that many people are still blind to the fact of racism and discrimination against different ethnic backgrounds. I also think that most don't even think about the regular use of stereotypes that get used everyday. I can't say I was a huge fan of this movie. Even though spike lee played Mookie in this film and directed it and did a good job, I just wasn't a fan. I found myself more frustrated with the content of the movie than anything else. It was horrible to see the cops kill radio and just the use of names. I also think that this movie is one sided in a way. I thought the movie set was colorful and I honestly couldn't tell you what I thought of the sound because only two things stick out. The fight the power song and the voice over of the radio host. I thought the last scene was the most powerful and I felt like the film left you asking who did the right thing. Over all it was not a terrible movie. I personally found that it was too frustrating and sad to really enjoy the film.",,16 December 2011
Untitled,"Went into this film mostly because of interest in production set scenes.

It was filmed in a dilapidated black American neighbourhood in New York city.

It was around 1988-89, a time South Korean and Chinese immigrants had been moving in the States and Northern American continent region in general, at a certain peaked rate to my knowledge, in this film particularly a Korean family opened a family shop finds on scene and was not that impressed by black communities in some way. It is coming off from a scene of the film studiously as an anecdote, i take notice naturally.

A spike lee film, original songs for soundtrack, that 'fight the power', sounds vibrant.

The peeling walls, dripping filthy wet around kerb on street, all look vivid to me. I always appreciate these sort of set scenes impersonally, in the meantime, can't help running my private reveries, what I was doing, where I was at that time, a little hick at another end of a pathetic world, by the time, It was.

A production set design makes me, as an onlooker, almost sense the musty sweetish smell of that place in NYC at that time.

Well made.",,6 June 2024
Race Relations Solved...Not Quite.,"Loved this when it was first released, but am now afraid I and the movie were then both linked in immaturity. I was leaning on the fast forward button the whole time during a recent viewing, and just wonder why Spike chooses not to edit his films. This one is about an hour too long. The feel of the movie now reminds me of a perverted Sesame Street with a lesson of only mistrust and hatred. Todays letter, is the letter F.

Best part is the dancing during the opening sequence. Best part by far, that I will watch again. Not the rest.",,25 August 2002

Mookie threw the can to save his reputation,"I thought that the window part was done in his own self defense. When the riot somewhat settled down there was a distinct space between the black people and the white people. Mookie was on the side with the whites. As enraged as the blacks were, I felt that if he didnt do anything, then he would be somewhat of a traitor to his black community and their rage would unleash onto all four of them. Since his life was crappy anyways, his accidental child, poor work ethics, and lack of education, while living with his sister, the only thing he really had was the respect from his friends, which he wanted to keep. By throwing the trash can he made a statement saying that he is with his own kind on this riot.",,28 April 2004

Better Thing review,"One Professor Klystron (PK) gave a better review of Do the Right Thing for the Humanities Film Forum (non-spam noncommercial). The site is yourpiratestation.com ...Humanities Film Forum (committee)Must See list. In brief: 1. There certainly is a plot. 2. Movie was born of changes. 3. 9 stars out of 10 excellent. 4. Story took place over time (not 24 hours). More here: Do the Right Thing was influenced by Danny Aiello's script and plot changes and additional technical help was provided by WJIT Radio NJ USA. This is a good people Vs gits story. When the last reel has ended, you have to pit Lee's message against the Chill Out urges of most of the other characters. I would recommend it as a milestone to anyone who ever considered moving to a big city.(mistake).",,1 November 2004
A melting pot of good points that somebody dumps down the drain,"What bothers me about the people in `Do the Right Thing' is that the potential peacemakers in the story are overshadowed or out-shouted by the ones who use violence to make their points. This comment rings with truth, considering every major character ultimately resorts to violence. Mookie sometimes tries to rationalize with his friends, and also tells `Buggin Out' to stop yelling at Sal, but it didn't seem like he wanted to. He was torn between being black, and respecting his employer. The movie would have been much better if it focused on Mookie's personal debate over staying true to his roots, and siding with `Buggin Out,' or trying to keep order, not advocating violence. While the film sometimes delves into this subject, it seems the movie's main attraction was the destruction at the end. Death, fire, rage are all powerful human emotions, but they have become so cliché, that an abstract look at Mookie's dilemma would have accentuated the `peace' message. But the movie, instead, decides to concentrate on dealing out racial stereotypes by the dozen. Most of the Africans are rude, all the Orientals run convenience stores, often quoting the notorious `You buy, or you go!,' the Italians are racist, and the cops are lazy. What escapes me, however, is Lee's logic in thinking that race riots, vulgarities, and one constant song would display the disgusting nature of racism, and racially motivated violence, coupled with the fact that none of the characters involved exhibit any form of respect, dignity, or moral aptitude. They are always at each other's throats, always bickering, never thinking about or even rationalizing their actions. The one thing on their mind is violence. The next day only emphasizes this by the way Lee displays the town. Nothing has changed. Nobody presents any negative effects (excluding Sal). Mookie, the one character who had a conscience, only goes to Sal for money. There is no remorse, no call for change. The people involved in destroying life and property don't give a second thought to the effects of their actions. This movie annoyed me. Not by the message, but by the dialogue. Do the Right Thing sent a message using all the wrong techniques.",,3 April 2001
