The truffle shuffle.,"Comparisons to 'John Wick (2014)' are both apt and, perhaps, misleading; in many ways, 'Pig (2021)' is the antithesis of the revenge thriller. It isn't about vengeance, it's about love, loss, grief and gourmet cooking. In fact, the protagonist comes face to face with the people who whack him in the head and steal his pig in the movie's opening movement surprisingly early on, showing no desire to hurt them and instead being wholly focused on recovering his lost pet. It's generally a quiet, contemplative and purposefully counter-intuitive affair that subverts almost every expectation that comes with its set-up and the fact that it stars Nic Cage. Cage is remarkably restrained here, delivering a heavy yet nuanced performance that's actually rather affecting. Some of his conversations hit surprisingly hard, even if some of them are rather difficult to hear (the dialogue is oddly quiet and muffled at times). On top of its more straightforward narrative, the film has plenty to say about commerce vs creativity, compromised dreams, self-imposed isolation, gentrification, monopolisation, regret, companionship and the necessity of being able to 'move on'. It's purposefully unsatisfying, which is actually oddly satisfying if you think about it. It's relatively realistic yet still retains its own sense of low-key style. It's also really sad overall. It isn't consistently gripping, but it's always interesting and generally entertaining, too. It's an accomplished piece of work. 7/10.",7.0,16 January 2022
Phenomenal...Just Phenomenal!!,"This movie brought back life to Cinema! And it's absolutely stunning, touching, real and Authentic. In a world of plastic CGI and ultra unrealistic movies which you can absolutely not relate to, this one is a breath of fresh air that will touch the inner most part of you heart. I felt it as tears rolled on my cheek's (I miss you dad). Kudos to the entire production team and welcome back Cage ; we have waited for this from you for a long time. Thank you so much.",8.0,20 July 2021
Cage pigs out in Portland...,"While i'm certainly not on the 'Pig is a masterpiece' bandwagon, this is still an oddly engaging low key indie-flick with decent cinematography, sharp editing and an aptly atmospheric score, further boosted by the brilliance of Cage and a solid supporting cast, including the wonderful truffle pig itself!

However, it's a slow moving ditty that never really takes off and i was somewhat disappointed with the undercooked finale. It also has to be noted that our disheveled hero goes through the entire movie filthy dirty, bloodsoaked and battered in many public places without nary a raised eyebrow, which stretches all boundaries of credibility... and i'm not talking about the pig here!

Regardless of its faults, this sombre thought=provoking tale of love, loss and loneliness is worth a watch if you want to check out something fresh and quirky, and it's certainly good to see the enigmatic Nic Cage putting in a such solid turn again in between his many recent howlers (take note Neeson, Madsen and Willis). Bon appetite. Oink oink.",7.0,20 July 2021
"Unconventional love story, a man and his pig.","I'm not sure what I expected but what I got surprised me. I like Nic Cage but I don't always like the choices he makes. This role is a good one. He is a wilderness man in Oregon, the state with the best hunting for truffles. He lives in a very rustic cabin, gets supplied delivered weekly, in exchange he provides top quality truffles. We see him early making a rustic mushroom tart, we get a sense of what his former career might have been.

The incident happens very early in the movie, at the 11 minute mark, when in the dead of night men break in, knock him unconscious, and steal his prize pig. The rest of the movie is his efforts to find his pig and get it back. More because of his attachment to the pig, not so much for his truffle hunting.

The overall theme is dealing with loss and grief, and not only one person or one loss. It is not a superficial story that one can pay scant attention to. Cage is really good in the role, as a former top chef who dropped out of the mainstream.

Some very important things you may have missed (Spoilers below),,10.0,27 July 2021
I'd like to speak to the chef.,"Pig follows a truffle hunter named Rob who lives alone in the wilderness of Oregon with his beloved foraging pig. One day, his pig is stolen, and he sets out on a mission to find her, revealing a hidden past and putting him in touch with his estranged former life in the process.

This movie is not your typical Hollywood production. Instead, it's a slow-burning character study that explores themes of loss, grief, and redemption. Nicolas Cage delivers a subdued, nuanced performance, showing a depth and range that remind us of his acting abilities beyond his typically over-the-top roles. He portrays Rob as a man who has suffered a great deal, but who has not lost his humanity, compassion, or love for his pig.

The cinematography is stunning, capturing the beauty of the Pacific Northwest wilderness, and the soundtrack is haunting and atmospheric, adding to the film's melancholic and introspective mood. The supporting cast also delivers strong performances, particularly Alex Wolff as Amir, a young and ambitious chef who becomes entangled in Rob's quest.

""Pig"" is a quiet and contemplative film that rewards patient viewers with a moving and profound experience. It's not a film for everyone, but for those willing to engage with its themes and characters, it's a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant work of art.",7.0,4 April 2023
"""We don't get a lot of things to really care about.""","What a beautiful movie. Not everyone is going to love it, I've seen some of the reviews here, and frankly, they didn't understand what the film was going for. Seldom has there been such a raw portrayal of love and caring for the things that really matter, and decluttering life of all the unnecessary BS. A film that doesn't treat it's audience like idiots, letting you paint your own picture while still wholly understanding the message. Reserved and much more than skin deep, Nicolas Cage delivers a painfully Oscar-worthy performance. Go and see this movie!",9.0,18 July 2021
Could've gone down the obvious route but didn't,"There's always something to look forward to in a Nicolas Cage film. Even though nowadays Cage does abysmal films, there's one or two great ones that come with it and Pig is one of them.

Pig follows Rob, a truffle hunter who lives in the woods with his beloved pig. One day, his pig gets kidnapped and he returns to Portland to search for it.

This film could've easily gone down the simple revenge route these stories tend to have but Pig decided to take a slower and deeper approach. In his directorial debut, Michael Sarnoski displays a lot of promise as a director and storyteller. He takes this simple premise and creates a lot of emotion in it. For his first film, it looks really good. The camerawork is fantastic and I liked a lot of the darkness and dim lighting that captured the devastated mood Rob was in the entire time. Despite its 90 minute runtime, the film does move at a slow pace and the lack of action may be bothersome to some people. I did start to feel the pacing at certain points and I definitely could've been more invested in what was going on but I wasn't.

It was refreshing to see characters handle a situation like in a calm yet emotionally effective way rather than going down the typical action route and a lot of the emotion works due to the solid acting. Nicolas Cage is the best he's been in years. Beautifully understated and a man of very few words, Cage is able to channel the distressed nature of Rob in such a believable manner. As much as I would've loved to see Cage go ballistic, it was a nice change of pace to see him in a role he doesn't normally do. I was also surprised to see Alex Wolff in a film like this but he did a good job as well and played along nicely with Cage. Another great performer was Adam Arkin who had some great scenes with Cage and Wolff.

Pig ended up being an experience I didn't expect. I didn't feel as emotionally invested as the film wanted me to but I admire Sarnoski's unique approach to this story and Nicolas Cage for providing one of the best performances of his career.",7.0,15 September 2021
"Battle of the IMDb Reviewers, eh?","I told my wife about the hugely polarized reviews for this flick. Curiosity got the best of us.

Reluctantly, I put it in and we both watched it.

On behalf of the PROs: It was put together well. Cage does a pretty good job. It does have a degree of, shall I say, poignancy. Understanding Cage's character and more importantly, what drives him is perhaps the main thrust of the film. A part of his character is revealed by how the others players who know (or have known) him, perceive him, which (in earnest), is one of awe and respect to one degree or another. Also, that perception is contradictory to his appearance. Cage's character has no interest in self presentation, (it's more than a disheveled look, particularly after getting beat up), and this too, is a part of who he is, or has become.

On behalf of the CONs: It does move slowly. There's no new parable(s) here, no real allegorical message, etc. And even if his appearance is a part of who he is, somebody hit the guy with a firehouse. It's gets old fast. When they get around to putting olfactory effects in the new TV's, this movie won't be played much.

There's no real climax other than Cage finding out about his Truffle Pig's final disposition.

Here's our conclusion. Those reviews between 4-7 are most accurate. . The movie DOES play like an odyssey to a degree. That's a good thing. Without that attribute, the reviews should be 1-3.

Neither my wife or I would ever consider watching it twice. And that's indicative, to some degree, that we wasted our time. Do we regret spending time watching it? My wife says it's a toss up while I lean toward (""give me back my 2 hours."")

So, it has its positives, and its negatives. I felt it was a 5 star movie as did Evelyn. It was put together with sensitivity, but a drag just the same.

As usual, it's a matter of taste.

You be the judge.

Thx.

What a wonderful film.,"This is a film about loss and grief on many levels. In fact each of the main characters are hurting big time in one way or another and they are all drawn together because of a (totally gorgeous) pig. Whilst only being on screen for such a short time the pig causes events in peoples lives that are monumental. This is such a clever story, beautifully filmed, edited, scored, directed and acted by everyone.",7.0,9 August 2021

One of the best films and performances of the year.,"""Pig"" is a title so unimpressive that you may ignore what is arguably one of the best films of the year. Additionally, Nicolas Cage does his finest work since Leaving Las Vegas, for which he won the Oscar playing a troubled drunkard. Forget his hack work of late-this is his real deal.

In Pig, he plays a troubled former top chef (companion piece at this time to the doc Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain?), Rob, who has forsaken his domain, Portland, Oregon, and gone into the wilderness with his truffle-hunting, brindle-colored pig, Brandy. When she is kidnapped, he must leave his hideout to find her in the city.

In a slowly-distributed exposition, we learn about his culinary influence on Portland and his sorrow at losing his wife. Cage plays him taciturn and gruff, a literate Grizzly Adams, if you will. When he does briefly open up, or unload, on a current chef he knew back in the day, talented writer/director Michael Sarnoski and writer Vanessa Block have him express his belief that people should follow their dream, grasping onto something that has meaning and losing all that distracts from that goal. Well-written apologia, and well-acted.

Of course, pursuing his dream of isolation is what he has done until his love of Brandy drives him into the world and his past. Cage plays Rob right, just slow and introverted enough for us to savor the greatness he was and the misanthrope he has become. A talented and philosophical recluse he is.

As we eventually see him re-create a gourmet meal from his capacious memory (he forgets neither meals nor those he has served), we verify his greatness and understand his dislike for mankind. The narrative is lean and reasons not always evident, but the truth about what he says of the world is never lost.

In the isolation all of us have experienced over the last year and a half, it is enlightening to experience someone else's, which is never totally understood but nonetheless profound and relatable. Don't let anyone tell you nothing happens in Pig, for as in Nomadland, everything is happening. It is about all of us, our successes and failures with our losses of love hurting most of all. In theaters.",,21 July 2021
Strange Odyssey,"Who knew that the truffle industry was such a thing in the Pacific Northwest?

Well I do now, because I've seen ""Pig,"" a movie about a man who goes on a strange odyssey to reclaim his kidnapped truffle pig. Nicolas Cage is that man, because a movie with such a strange premise must star Nicolas Cage.

Of course the pig isn't really just a pig, and the kidnapping only serves as a catalyst for a plot that explores grief and remorse. Yippee. Yet another somber movie about grief and remorse. Welcome to the COVID movie world everybody.

""Pig"" would be a better movie if it wasn't so stingy with its secrets. Details and plot points do eventually click into place, but not until the film has made its audience wait and wait and wait for the revelations we feel like we know are coming. And even then the backstory feels a bit murky, and I wasn't sure I completely connected all the dots. I suppose this could be an argument for the film's re-watch value, but it would have to be a much better movie to make me want to watch it again.

Despite its flaws, though, it's a decent enough movie to sit through once. Cage has been lauded for his performance, but I enjoyed the performance of Alex Wolff more. He plays a slick buyer of Cage's truffles and joins him on his quest. His character's arc is so big and Wolff plays it so well that the movie feels like it's as much about him as it is Cage.

This was really good,It was really powerful and mesmerizing. It could be a little slow at times but there are some good twists and turns.

"Tough, raw, and gritty film of loss, pain, and sorrow.","""Pig"" is without a doubt a film that's clearly different and away from some normal film norms, still even as the story is that of a lost pig the movie connects with themes of drama and emotions. Set in the rural Oregon wilderness Rob(in a good well done performance from Cage) is a lonely truffle hunter who lives life rough raising his own food and living like a hermit rarely getting out and even so and then he gets drama from his old rattle trap truck. However his beloved pet pig keeps him going, then the world is turned upside down when Rob's pig is kidnapped. This then takes the film on a past journey of things, and people that Rob remembers as he does a search and travel in the big city of Portland looking for his pig. The film is raw and gruff with Nicolas looking his rugged best with long hair and a beard, however Rob's character is that of a fighter as he searches bars, restaurants, and homes of people from the past just to find his pig. Still even though this story involves a lost animal the drama, pain, emotion, and sorrow matches that of any human story. Overall ""Pig"" is one eye opening touching painful film that shows how when connection and attachment is lost it brings sorrow.",9.0,14 November 2021
"""We don't get a lot of things to really care about""","This won't be everyone's favorite movie. I went into it thinking it's a revenge/rescue mission movie like John Wick or Nobody. It's not. It's a lot deeper than that and the more you learn about Nicholas Cage's character the more you realize this is a character study, one where put yourself in his shoes and reflect on all the obstacles life throws. The biggest theme is grief and loss, in various forms, and choosing to move forward in the face of it.

It is not a happy or action-packed movie. But it's a short film and makes you feel things. I'm primarily feeling sad and probably won't watch it again but not regretting it either.",7.0,9 April 2024
An astonishing and assured debut with a stunner of a Cage turn,"An astonishing and assured debut; Pig may get you into the theater with the veneer of a darker/darker hued John Wick (by way of, hmm, how's about Leave No Trace, that works for me), but it's much more than that suggests. This is a rather devastating and deeply emotional film about loss, of self and others and the toll that takes, and how it shows ultimately much more courage to reach into someone else's soul, especially if it's a person who wronged you, than to go about the usual revenge narrative. I won't say how this happens, but it's a film that earns its tragic countenance and the look of the film itself (as I told my wife on the way home, the color choice almost looks like a truffle).

On that level the filmmaker is also rigorous into exploring forgiveness and how painful opening those wounds can be. I don't want to give too much of the experience away, it's a true character piece in a vein we so rarely get with this actor - I'll go ahead and say it, this is on the level with a Leaving Las Vegas or Joe - but what turned this from very good to one of the year's best was the scene where Rob talks to the chef at the restaurant. What a character. And Cage only brings big displays of this person's grief and anger a handful of times; he's now at that stage where he can come into a room and say little and command attention. And the supporting work from Wolff and Arkin et al is also excellent and matches him.

In sum: That'll do, Nicolas. That'll do.",10.0,16 July 2021

Painfully Slow,"I will start by saying that I'm a Nicolas Cage fan. I think he's great. I recognize a lot of his movies stink but I think he's a likable guy. With that said, I saw Pig had great critic reviews and I like Nicolas Cage so I was eager to see it. I left the theater very disappointed and I had to wake my wife up before we left. Pig is a beautifully filmed cinematic delight. The musical score went excellent with the scenes and added a very nice feel to the movie. I even thought the acting of Nicolas Cage and Alex Wolff was good! However, the whole movie is just a long EXTREMELY DRAWN OUT story that you are waiting to take off and get interesting, but it unfortunately never does. It feels like nothing happens the whole movie which was the ultimate disappointment after reading many of the great reviews. Maybe I'm missing some deeper meaning, but overall Pig is slow and many scenes don't even make sense. I would not recommend this film if you want to save yourself 2 hours. 4.8/10.",4.0,18 July 2021
Welcom back nicolas cage,"One to watch, flawless acting some of his best work yet welcome back nicolas cage.",9.0,18 July 2021
Fighting to be serious...,"Like a good Nic Cage film, this film takes a silly, dare I say stupid, premise (yes about a pig), and treats it with far more respect and seriousness than it is owed. Throughout the film, I found myself unable to not look at someone else I was watching the film with and say ""PIIIIIGGGGG!"" If my timing was good I would be met with an equally enthusiastic ""PIIIIGGGGG!"" back. Nic Cage does what he does best, and plays into the film, making it seem like it is something real, serious, and threatening when at its core it is a movie about a truffle hunter, his pig, and uncovering secrets you would never actualize on first glace.

BUT....

Here's the thing, it kind of works. I wanted to give this film a bad review (or at least a mediocre one) after I finished watching it. I walked away confused at what I saw: love for a pig, Nic Cage's refusal to clean himself, truffle cartels?, but the truth is I did enjoy the film. Good films make you set aside reality all the time, sure this one takes place in contemporary Portland, there is nothing magical or fantastic about it, but if you simply let yourself believe in the story it is trying to tell, believe in the world, it tells a compelling tale of love, family, and death, asks deep questions about what it means to be alive, and examines how our past affects our future. The cinematography is great, the music is good (although I think they were trying to be more clever with it than I picked up on), and the acting was, for lack of a better word, Nic Cage. It is not a masterpiece, but it is good and to the right person great.

There is still part of me that wants to give it at least a 6, but also a part of me that thinks if I assess my experience watching it, and not the time spent trying to rationalize it, it deserves an 8 or 9. I think a 7 will do it just fine.",7.0,9 February 2024
So joyless and pretentious that it's forced me to violate my own rule,"My general rule, which I hate to break, is never to award a movie merely a single star, no matter how awful it may be. After all, a lot of time, sweat, money, and hope go into every production, and filmmakers are, for the most part, smart, engaging people who've tried their best to do good work. Commenters on IMDb who hand out one-star ratings are grinches, curmudgeons. They're simply not being fair.

But PIG is so utterly empty and unrewarding -- and clearly has such airy, exalted pretensions -- that it deserves just one star. And that star is for the title creature, which receives way too little screen time. Aside from its brief appearance, there wasn't a single scene, a single character, a single line of dialogue -- in truth, not a single moment -- that gave me any joy. And when the film was over, I felt rather cheated. I'm just glad I didn't pay for it.",1.0,19 July 2021
Good mystery and suspense,"Nicholas Cage has been in many bad films on recent years, but I must say he's successfully turned it around with the recent few films.

I find it a pleasurable and engaging watch.",,18 July 2021

The movie has took a simple concept of a man looking for a pig into something that was mesmerizing in both visual and story.

If you've read a sort of summary of what this is going to be ... I imagine there are things that are not covered. Things that may feel weird while you watch it. You may expect certain things to happen in this movie ... but the movie will not satisfy those needs or even wants. It will follow its own route/road and its own pace ... which is quite slow. A movie called something with Joe that Cage starred in, is one that reminds me mood and pace wise of this. Still way different overall - so I'm not comparing the movies.

One of the best films of the year.,"""Pig"" is a movie that wrong-foots you at every juncture; even the opening moments hint at a totally different film than the one that follows. Is this a period piece, a western like ""First Cow"" or will it be a thriller with a 'Die Hard' hero, (and in recent years Nicolas Cage has played his fair share of those)? Actually, it's neither although there are elements of both in first-time writer/director Michael Sarnoski's sublime scenario which is an original screenplay of the utmost originality.

We first meet Cage living in a kind of forest wilderness, totally cut off from the outside world, except for his one visitor, (he doesn't even have a mobile phone). His 'business' is finding truffles and to this end he has a pig and that one viistor seems to be his only customer, a young hot-shot with a fancy car and a bit of an attitude. And then one night his pig is stolen.

Fundamentally, this extraordinary film is about Cage's search for the pig, aided by that young hot-shot but despite an early sequence that might have come from ""Fight Club"", don't expect a thriller or even an action flic. Slowly we get to know who Cage is or was and our preconceptions fall away. Yes, it's a character piece but it's also a 'foodie' film as well as a film about isolation, loneliness and friendship and neither it nor its superb cast ever puts a foot wrong.

Cage has always been a superb actor but with a sometimes unfortunate tendency towards mania. Occasionally this has served him well, (""Raising Arizona"", ""Peggy Sue Got Married"", winning an Oscar in ""Leaving Las Vegas""), but this is an entirely insular performance and it's the best thing he's done in years. As the boy who goes along with him, without even knowing who he is, Alex Wolff is also excellent, (he was the son in ""Hereditary""). Not a great deal actually happens but Sarnoski holds you in a vice-like grip throughout aided, not just by his cast, but by the beautiful images of cinematographer Patrick Scola and Alexis Grapas and Philip Klein's score. Come Awards Season I have a feeling ""Pig"" will do very nicely indeed.",9.0,24 July 2021

"Tale of a broken individual, both in past and present","Michael Sarnoski's debut feature, Pig, is mostly a character study of an individual dealing with past and present loss. The film also touches the concept of road movies ,unlikely friendships, some existential themes and dissects anti-revenge motif. Nicolas Cage plays Robin,a desolated individual living in the Oregon woods, selling elusive truffles. One day his prized truffle pig is abducted by some people. Escaping death, Robin sets out to find his pig, with the help of his young dealer, Amir.

Sarnoski delicately creates our protagonist character Robin,a man of mystery. The other character, Amir is also somewhat quirky. He knows a little of Robin, apart from the fact that he's a truffle hunter. But as the two set on a mission to find the pig, through Amir's eye, we slowly get to know Robin. Amir takes him in his car from place to place. They travel, form an unlikely bonding, considering their age and status. Scene by scene we see Robin's tragic past unfolding. He suffered some terrible losses in the past forcing him into isolation. But what will he do now as his only companion in the woods gets stolen? Will he take revenge? Or get into another phase of his self-exile?

Nicolas Cage gives a powerful portrayal of grief stricken person suffering from immense pain and agony. Robin is also a stern example of an established figure turned into ruins. It could be a wild guess but I was thinking about the similarities between Robin and Cage himself, about how both of them went downhill from top in their respective careers. Who knows!

There are lots of plot elements in the film. But what Pig suffers most is that it gives us glimpses ,but never really explores them. Robin's dilemma about his pig, his past life, his sorrows, Amir's own personal problems- all of these are touched but remained solely on the surface. As a result, I was left with a mixed feeling of wanting more. The film seemed to end just when it looked to be building for climax. It did have a potential to be a great film but fell short.

That being said, Pig does make some strong points. It marked a strong directorial debut for Sarnoski. There were some serene wide angle shots of Oregon wilderness throughout. But most of the time the camera was close to Robin, capturing his brawls ,sweats and raw emotions. It's also great to see Nicolas Cage back with one hell of a performance. Surely we can expect there's more to come from him.",7.0,21 July 2021

"With Nick Cage, expect the unexpected but don't confound with A Pier Pasolini's famous film.","Nick Cage is definitely able to play in ANY kind of movie, ANY KIND. No there is no Nick Cage's dopplaganger, this is the same actor who can play in a pure little gem and then two weeks later - because Cage works like a chain factory employee on an overtime schedule, 24/7 - be present in a pure garbage junk. That's Nick Cage. So, I am not that surprised. This movie can be seen as a kind of mix-up between JOHN WICK and Pier Paolo Pasolini's PORCILE; one of the rarest film showing the ""complex"" relationship between a human being and pigs.... I know that this comparison may shock some of you but that's my analysis. Since 2014 JOE, in amore or less same kind of character, Nick Cage did not give me such pleasure.",,16 March 2023

"Simple, beautiful and full of relatable emotion.","In our current world of mass media and fast food this film shows another side to humanity that is not about the cut throat, rat race of success.

Nicholas Cage is excellent in this, as he is in most of his films. In my opinion he is probably the most underrated actor of all time.

I'm getting quite sick of negative reviews from people on this platform. Quite obviously people who have always wanted to make film but never knew how, or worse never tried to. Let's see your film.

Shockingly Brilliant,"There are very few times I have watched a film and feel like a complete emotional mess, and even fewer where I have been left speechless- but somehow Pig manages to accomplish both. It may seem a bit average at first, mediocre even, but as Pig paces itself to tell its fantastic story- you are soon treated to a film full of wonderment and surprise- that is as simple as it is brilliant. It will probably be overshadowed, as the film is a small release and wasn't released for awards season, but Cage deserves an Oscar for his performance in this film- in easily one of the best performances i've ever seen from him. First time director Michael Sarnoski makes his debut in this film, and also wrote the film, which I have to admit is one h*** of an achievement. The film is so well crafted under Sarnoski care, that it feels incredibly personal, and most importantly- incredibly grounded- which is a total breath of fresh air from many of the blockbuster films today. The cinematography is subtle and somber, and the music is excellent. The whole film feels like something that shouldn't work, that shouldn't have even been made, but it does, and its easily one of the years best.

Did you love National Treasure? It's nothing like that.,"I am not a fan of depressing movies. If there no hope at the end or no lessons learned to better those moving forward, why make it? I occasionally watch one but I never recommend them.

I just watched Pig, fully expecting a good chance that it could be just that. I watched it because I like Nicholas Cage. I like his action movies, I like his train wrecks, and occasionally I get to see a brilliant performance. I've turned some off before because let's face it, he never turns down a script and some are exactly what I described above - dark, depressing, no hope dirges.

Pig was not that... It wasn't a feel good movie but it didn't leave me unsettled.

I enjoyed the relationship between Rob and Amir - it seems both were able to take something of value from the other.

I can see that some people have wanted more dialog or action but I was fine with the pacing and messaging. I was able to ignore some of the more surrealistic parts - it wasn't so much about the factual retelling but more about the relationships and characters.

I'll finish with this: It is a crime that it didn't get a single nomination by the Academy.

Looking uncouth, smelly, with caked on bloody face (all for no apparent reason, he could have easily washed), he roams around the city, engages with a young boy, dines in fine dining restaurants with no one so much as giving him a second look, or calling the cops on him.

John Wicker Man...Pig,"I would say this is one of Nic Cage's best movies even without him over-Nic Caging the role.

It IS a slow burn and non-action version of John Wick, only these bad guys are stealing his pet PIG vs killing his dog. BUT, it's a fantastic and suspenseful journey of this man with one simple request: Give him back his pig.

Nic Cage plays a disgustingly dirty, quiet, mostly annoying and deep forest-dwelling character who has quite the rep in nearby Portland, OR. When some randos swing by and steal his companion, a very smart and loveable pig, Robin (Cage) will do ANYTHING to get it back.

At first, I thought this was a sci-fi because this pig was delivering magic pods...somehow. But then the plot SLOWLY reveals itself, what Robin is and was and the story just kept getting better and better all the while being somewhat off and weird - in a great and original way.

Despite the admitted slow pace mentioned twice above, this is tension-packed. I was, and you should be, too, on the edge of my seat for most of this movie. I loved this experience and despite actually being annoyed and impatient with Robin (MANY TIMES,) I overall loved this movie and I'd put it up there with his other great and recent movie: Mandy.

***

Final Thoughts: I wonder with his recent string of GREAT movies and performances: does this prove he's actually a genius? Since he makes 4-5 movies A YEAR, it seems, it would be harder to just dive into a top ten, but suffice to say, he's been in and made better SO MANY great and fun movies. My all-time favorite would have to be Leaving Las Vegas. Pig and Mandy? Actually, would easily fit in the top 5.",9.0,5 December 2021

"""You live your life for them and they don't even see you""","Author's note: I've had this app for nearly a decade without making an official account, but after reading the cringeworthy user reviews for this masterpiece, that had to change.

Michael Sarnoski has burst onto the scene with one of the most impressive directorial debuts in recent memory. While containing all the elements of your John Wick-esque revenge flick, Sarnoski subverts the standard genre tropes, providing a meditation on broken men coping with loss in unhealthy ways. Now, any critique of this film would be remiss without mentioning the sheer powerhouse performance delivered by Nicolas Cage. Reminiscent of Ryan Gosling's turn in Drive, Cage carries the story predominantly in silence; making those rare moments of dialogue all the more impactful. To call it one of if not the greatest performance of his career would be like calling grass green or the sky blue; it just is. I don't know if there wasn't enough bodies hitting the floor or ""crazy"" Cage moments to satisfy the masses, but what we were given is something far more pure. Sarnoski delivers a human story that is universal in its poignancy; pig lover or no.",9.0,31 October 2021
Slow yet moving look into the mind of a culinary savant,"Pig is not what I was expecting it to be. Frankly I had no clue what Pig would ultimately shape into. It's a recipe so to speak. Equal parts character study of a man living away from society, with a smidgen of a mystery story on top. Add some additional ingredients like an underground fight club and a truffle buying underworld and you have an interesting hodge podge of film making.

While some might have been hoping for a zesty helping of ""full Cage"" by Nicolas Cage, we instead got the restrained and pensive brutality of Robin Feld. He is Gordon Ramsay sans the outbursts, for his words in the scene with one of his former employees is all we needed to know about his limited back story. He is dedicated, precise and has an impeccable palate. He believes in dreams and desires, not what will gain the shrill favor of fickle investors and foodie elitists.

The story to Pig is very simple and straight forward. Even the so called twist at the end is not really a twist but a revelation. Nicolas Cage transforms seamlessly into his dirty and grimy role, never washing himself off and never once looking like someone who cares about social mores. It's a good vehicle for him to play in, and I highly recommend the curt simplicity of Pig.",7.0,8 August 2021

"I was thinking, If I never came looking for her, in my head, she'd still be alive.","From the serene cinematography in the beginning, you could tell that the film would be aesthetically pleasing from the smooth peaceful running water and earthly freedom of the forest.

It's slow, but in a good way, as it establishes a deep connection between an isolated man who has settled down as a truffle hunter with his companion pig and seems content without the need to move on with his life.

We know that this man was once well-known and highly respected. However, he chooses to hide away from the world after the passing of his wife. The film skillfully depicts the emotional bond Rob forms with the Pig. Their connection visually shows genuine happiness and joy simply from being in each other's presence.

The setup and the subsequent home break-in are poignant and genuinely saddening leading to Rob going on a journey in which he has to open himself back up into the world he had left behind.

Nicholas Cage delivered a stunning performance. He was astonishing in this role. It was an excellent casting choice, showcasing his versatility where it suits his scope as an actor.

The performances by Alex Wolf (Amir) and Adam Atkins (Darius) were also noteworthy, displaying tremendous emotional depth.

A culmination of the story is when Rob says to Darius, ""he remembers every person he ever served, and every meal he ever cooked,"" implying a remembrance of dining between Darius and the tragedy of losing his late wife. It adds layers to the characters, their personalities, and why they are the way they are.

This was a positive directorial debut by Michael Sarnoski who's film's underlying message was powerful - we never truly know someone's past or what they have been through. Consequently, when Rob's story becomes known, the impact on those around him is profound, revealing a new lease of compassion.

Rob's transition throughout the film is spectacular, but unfortunately, the ending falls short of expectations. Pig needed a far more impactful closure to make the journey feel worthwhile. Instead, it concludes in a rather bleak and daunting fashion.

Due to the ending, it's a film you will likely only watch once. However, Pig's simple and compelling storytelling makes a reliable mark on how to portray an emotional reality.

My Scorecard (7.2),"It's not just about a simple pig and its abduction.

Loss - and coping with it - is the main course in this visual art banquet. Will you be mesmerized by the sylvan setting or left melancholic by the autumnal color palette and its musical accompaniment?

The meaning this movie will have depends only on yourself, and yourself alone; grief and sorrow are always subjective. Pig leaves you with something bittersweet that very few films are capable of, leaving you questioning if you had a ""pig"" and what did you do to save it. Everyone can see in that animal their last anchor before their own mental decline, their own unique way of coping with a major loss, thier last contact with the real external world.

This movie made me refelct on what runs behind everyone's lives, what were their experiences, what shaped their personality and their response to bad events. Each one of us is unique, but we all have something in common: it's life itself, and life will naturally bring her sister, death.

We were not made to last eternally, however, what we do in our lives is important, to ourselves and to others. It can have an impact on paths we don't even aknowledge, be either positive or negative, be either effective on one single second or an entire life. Everything is important on this earth, even a simple meal can be so valuable to tear down so much as the strongest and most brutal men on the planet.

Meanings and memories that we attach to simple objects or ideas can, at the same time, give purpose for an entire life or destroy card castles built to protect our own soul from grief itself.

One of 2021's great movie surprises,"Most surprises in life aren't often of the pleasant variety but if there was a 2021 surprise for all of us to take stock in its Pig, a truly unlikely high-quality film that is absolutely not the movie you expect it to be, as it becomes both a touching drama and a timely reminder that when given the opportunity, the oft-maligned Nicolas Cage is still right up there with the very best working in the industry today.

What on paper may appear to be yet another tax necessity direct to video d-grader starring the one time Oscar winner, Pig is not Taken with hooves and is far removed from the type of mindless fare you'd expect from first time feature film director Michael Sarnoski, as we get a meditative, slowly-paced and effective examination of life, what we find purposes in and love as Sarnoski's 90 minute drama slowly begins to show it's hand on it's way too what is likely too remain one of 2021's most emotional poignant final stretches.

Appearing in almost every scene of the film, Nicolas Cage is award worthy here as reclusive truffle hunter Rob, a man who has eschewed society (and showers!) and only has one remaining contact in the form of Alex Wolff's (delivering a performance that is too worthy of award recognition) budding entrepreneur Amir and finds peace and meaning in his friendship with his beloved foraging pig that is taken from him by a bunch of strangers Rob is determined to track down.

Saying too much more about where Pig goes and how it goes about it would be a disservice to the carefully considered way in which Sarnoski and his leading man tell their tale but more often than not the story of Rob and his quest to discover who has his hooved friend takes us to unexpected places and deals with instances in unexpected ways and in a day and age where many films simply follow a path trodden out before them previously, Pig is a breath of fresh air in the most surprising of ways imaginable.

Also helping its case to becoming 2021's most unpredictably great drama and one of the best films of the year period is the films haunting and minimalistic score by Alexis Grapsas and Philip Klein, the moody cinematography by Patrick Scola and the pitch perfect script by Sarnoski, who has well and truly announced himself to the industry with this uniquely beautiful effort.

Final Say -

Put your prejudices aside and forget what type of film you think Pig is going to be on face value, this is one of 2021's best film's and a resounding reminder of the talents of Nicolas Cage.

This is easily the best role I have seen Alex Wolff in, especially since I do not enjoy him as an actor. Nicholas Cage does play that one quiet character who barely talks, but he actually does show some great acting later on. This film has a very simple story, but it was very enjoyable and despite being so short, it felt like the perfect length.

My only complaint really is that it felt like they had to stretch it out to 1hr 30 min, so they tried to stretch some shots for as long as they could.

The writing, directing, and acting are excellent. My only issue (as an actor and director myself) is with the director of photography. It is so very tiring to see yet another very good, possibly great, film use the ""Hand-held shaky camera effect"". Unfortunately, the effect, is based on pseudo-psychological science at best and is a complete lie at worst. The ""shaky camera"" DOES NOT simulate real life for viewers, AT ALL. Our brains are being fed a constant stream of information from all our senses and, therefore, out brains MUST edit the information so we can function. We, for the most part, are not aware of the motion of our heads/eyes each moment. Using the ""Shaky Camera"" effect FORCES an unnatural situation on our brains. It is NOT realistic and NOT clever.

Cage is grounded, his performance is excellent, and he really caries the whole film. Everything is beautifully shot, utilizing what seems to be almost entirely natural lighting. The writing is fantastic, and there are some truly poignant moments throughout. Some scenes do drag a little bit, and there are a few weird tonal issues (one including a random fight-club-esque scenario that doesn't really fit in with the rest of the film) but for the most part this is a beautiful, tragic, highly recommendable film.

Pig is a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.

At its core, it is a beautiful take on personal loss and finding ways of dealing with it. The movie does touch you at the end.

Anyone trying to tell you this is a 10/10 is 100% a shill,"This is an utterly mediocre film and no one should be pretending otherwise. The problem isn't simply a lack of action, it's a complete lack of compelling characters and story. It's a completely uninteresting script full of uninteresting dialogue that occasionally tries to make some points about various facets of society, but never actually tries to do any deep exploration of them or say anything remotely new or insightful about them (yes, the upper class is out of touch with humanity and treat people and animals like objects, how observant). Mostly it's just dry, droning dialogue, particularly when Cage is speaking in a surprisingly quiet, monotone, almost comically pause-filled voice that evokes thoughts of some kind of ASMR sleep aid video.

Also I think it's a little silly to be dismissive of people that were expecting this movie to be ""John Wick with a pig"" when the trailer for it leaned heavily into presenting it as such.

Ok,As of right now the score of this film is an 8.3/10. I don't think it deserves anywhere near that score. For me it was more of a 5.5-6-5. I enjoyed a few scenes and found the foundation of the story to be worth creating a movie around. I just didn't think there was enough meat to the story to keep me very interested during much of the ride. At only about a 90 minutes runtime. One would hope and expect for the movie to feel quick-paced and exciting. Instead it seemed like a slow burn sad independent movie(not saying sad or independent movies are all bad). I also found the filming to have more shaking camera-work than I prefer. I don't mind the usage of that type of shot for such a raw story as this one from time to time. But I felt it was used so much that it became distracting in a negative way. I also felt like they relied a bit too heavily on close-up shots. The acting seemed fine. I struggled to understand the dialogue a few times. But that might be a sound mixing and editing mistake more-so than an acting flaw.

"John Wick, with a pig right? Taken, with a pig right? Wrong.","No hardcore spoilers but plot details are examined. Maybe you should read this after?

There's your warning.

Got to catch a premier of this at Cinema 21 in Portland. It's a little extra special being as though the movie was filmed in Portland and made even cooler that the writer/director and writer/producer were there in attendance.

Pig opens in a forest, and a hermit looking man named Rob (Cage) is truffle hunting with his swine-companion merely named Pig. It feels old-world. It's beautifully shot. Then all of a sudden a bright yellow Camaro comes blaring up the path to Rob's hut. Wow, this takes place in 2021? It was surprising. Inside the Camaro is Amir (played by Alex Wolff of Hereditary fame). He buys the treasured truffles from Rob and sells them to high-end restaurateurs in Portland. One night thieves break into the hut, assault Rob and steal Pig. Rather than getting the blood-soaked rampage audiences could easily assume they're in store for, we get a quiet, slow burning story that painfully unfolds through Portland's underground foodie scene.

Nic Cage gives a measured, contemplative performance fueled by grief and anger but rarely letting himself emote or explode. When he speaks it's thoughtful and heavy. This is a wonderful project for Cage, and I love seeing actors do great work. Especially aging actors. Cage still has plenty of mileage left as he doles out the performances that pay the bills but also undertakes the roles that are challenging from talented filmmakers who realize he isn't a dancing, screaming monkey. We slowly learn small snippets of information about Rob. He's been living in his hut in the woods for over a decade, but at one point he was a chef of legendary renown. Simply saying his name turned heads and raised brows from chefs and customers alike. One day he disappears. We never really learn why, but it likely has to do with the death of his wife and the jaded cynicism with modern cuisine.

There is a good scene in which Rob explains to a higher end, five star chef that the pretentious food he is serving isn't real, the ""foodie"" customers aren't real, none of this modern malarkey means anything. It's bloated, it's fake, it's tasteless. This devastates the chef but there is a certain truth to what Rob says. Cage's delivery here is intense and dark but almost said with a note of self defeat. It's good stuff.

Rob partners with Amir to find out where Pig is and how to get her back. Alex Wolff gives a strong performance. To act alongside Cage and not just be overshadowed requires good writing and great performing. The team they form is funny and at times tumultuous yet most importantly they're believable. It also helps Wolff has a great emotional range on the canvas of his face. There are close up shots of him processing what's going on and he says so much without ushering a word (reminiscent of Hereditary). It's powerful stuff. Amir is trying desperately to make a name for himself in the industry without using the credentials of his celebrity chef father who he has been overshadowed by his entire life. After the loss of his mother, he and his father have little reason to communicate.

The reason this film is successful is because the duo is so good. Pig could've easily followed Rob the entire time but the fact that it doesn't gets us invested in both men and their plights for resolve by the end of the film.

Pig takes the difficult approach to dealing with grief and loss, it demonstrates the power of difficult conversation compared to the standard issue shoot out. I respect that. I appreciate it used violence as a catalyst to the plot but never to solve itself. That is realistic. Much like real life, the characters we meet continue living without drastic change. It's an interesting film made with a lot of love and care. I was feeling a little melancholic at the end of the film. I felt robbed of the emotional payoff I was setting up in my mind. I didn't get that, and I respect Pig for that. I am curious to see what first time filmmaker Michael Sarnoski has in store for us next.",8.0,16 July 2021
Surprising heart-wrencher,"This is one of those rare films where you have no idea what's going on exactly or where it's heading the whole way thru, and in your head attempting to answer those two questions with multiple guesses that are all wrong.

At every turn ""Pig"" subverts your expectations...but in a very clever good way. It seems to be taking you down a ""John Wick"" path, and it does, but not in the ways you could ever imagine. Brilliantly unusual details and trickery, yet always touching and full of heart.

Most films establish the synopsis or environment, they tell you what is happening, who people are, where they've been, what makes them tick, how they want to go, etc, in order to elicit your connectivity to the story and the characters.

The beauty of this film is that it tears all that away and makes you see what's really important, the only thing that's important -- not just for the characters but beyond the screen, reaching into you and striking that nerve in you. All that is important is love, the deep connections that don't require explanation. Nothing else really matters...career, money, acclaim, keeping up appearances, etc. Without love there is nothing. And with love anything is everything.

The story isn't necessary, the details of the characters aren't required, an idea of what's happening or who these people are isn't necessary. The film simply deconstructs us, all our superficial parts, and gently guides us along to identify with what being human is and what it means. That is all you need to bring into the cinema -- yourself.

Who you are, what your story is, what you're doing with your life, what's happening and where you're going....they're all equally unnecessary, unimportant. All that matters is that you feel, that your memories are evoked, seeing yourself in a mental mirror, recognizing all the connections you have and/or have neglected.

That is both the artistry displayed in the film (via the script, acting, music, visuals), and also the message of the film that comes along with you when you leave the cinema.",7.0,2 April 2022

The Anti Revenge Thriller,"If I was making a movie recipe for this movie by using other movies it would be: 1. 3 cups of ""Burnt"" 2. A pinch of ""John Wick"" 3. And a slice of ""You Were Never Really Here""

What I love most about this movie is the mystery. You will get up from this movie knowing just enough to keep you thinking about it for the next few days. You can tell that all the characters are connected, but you just want to know exactly how.

This is a movie about guilt, grief, and loss. This movie is also about defining success, and the director conveys that message all the way down to the music choices that the characters make while driving around.

Nicolas Cage gives a great soft performance here and commands the screen like a pro. Alex Wolff is here as well as is pretty good in his supporting role.

This is a movie where you need to shut everything off and pay attention to every detail so that you can fully understand the mystery and complications that the director is trying to convey.

If you go into this movie thinking that this movie is only about a pig OR that you won't cry over a story about a Pig. You're dead wrong.

For all of you revenge movie fans out there... I want to warn you... this is not the same movie you are used to. Go into this with an open mind with no preconceived notions of what you think this might be.

"A Bleak, Saddening and Unusual Anti-Revenge Thriller","This is such an unusual and abnormal role for Cage to take on, but it's also a role in which he gives one of the best performances of his career... and even of the year. Especially considering that this is the first feature from writer/director Michael Sarnoski, Pig may also very easily be one of the best films of the year. It's a phenomenally-crafted story of grief, pain and despair.

As said before, Nicolas Cage is outstanding in every second of this movie as he plays a truffle hunter who lives alone in the wilderness, and with only around 10 minutes to introduce us to his character, the setting and his beloved pig, the film dives into its concept very quickly as the animal is stolen and he sets out, returning to Portland to find the person who kidnapped her.

Pig isn't another John Wick-wannabe thriller with sustained action sequences featuring our lead viciously shooting up a bunch of bad guys who step in his way, although John Wick is an excellent assassin action movie. Hardcore vengeance isn't in the subject of this movie, as it's much rather a cinematic anti-revenge film with a very bleak atmosphere captured brilliantly by Sarnoski.

It's really just a story of love, loss and grief as a man attempts to find his pig. We learn a lot about Nicolas Cage's very worn-out character as the film plays out, there's a very clever and unique show-don't-tell element of storytelling, and overall, the majority of the film is well-paced and convincing, although not a film for everyone.

An unexpected story with heart,"There's plenty of room for stories like 'Pig' in the world: unexpected, unconventional, unique. The closest film I can compare it to is 'Ghost Dog' from Jim Jarmusch, in that it's a small indie film that follows an oddball character and has a lot of heart.

Let's start with Nic Cage, who gives his best performance, in my opinion. He plays an unlikeable yet sympathetic character, Robin Feld, who lives in the forest with his best mate, his pig, who helps him hunt prized truffles. A man of few words, Cage masterfully exudes his pain and suffering.

The photography around Portland and the forest is stunning, the pacing is perfect, the character development is superb across the board. I have a couple of complaints: some unnecessary backstory, without giving anything away, one of Robin's past hobbies seems totally out of place in the film, and some of the dialogue is a bit over the top.

All in all, 'Pig' is a satisfying watch: an unexpectedly touching performance by Cage and mystery unravelled layer by layer with some great suspense.",7.0,20 February 2022

"""Excuse me waiter, why is their a bloody scab in my soup?""","Firstly, I will say that Cage will 100% be Oscar nominated for his incredible outstanding performance... he's due for another one. They couldn't have cast anyone better. But also think... if someone else was cast, would this film be as hyped by the critics? I think not.

It does have its merits to great filmmaking, especially considering it's from a newb filmmaker; all casting and performances were spot on. Directing and cinematography were great. The sound and score on point. The story concept very original - but it won't be for everyone, and it wasn't for me.

I get the whole character study that explores grief, loss and life, but in the way it was told, was very outlandish and nonsense. It doesn't really make you care about anything, except if the pig has turned into bacon. Sure there's metaphors to dissect, but how do you explain a 3-day bloodied face? No water or towels around? If it was my apartment, first thing would be ""wash up, you're bloody and you stink"". It annoyingly detracts from the message, and that's only one example of ""unnecessary nonsense"".

Then add the ridiculously slow pacing, and some long dragged out and unnecessary scenes, it made the normally very comfortable 92 min runtime feel like almost 3 hours. And it's not like you'll get any real surprise or reward at the end of it all. It's a generous 6/10 from me, all for Cage and his ""I'mmm baaaack"" performance.

I checked several times to make sure I was watching the right movie. Like other reviewers I too am convinced that any 10/10 rating is a paid advertisement. I can appreciate an artsy slow burn with subtlety and nuance, but this was not that. I never leave reviews but I felt compelled to for this film.",1.0,20 July 2021
Very introspective,"The premise of the plot revolves around recluse Robin Feld who lives alone with this pet pig in the forest. Robin was assaulted in his home one night and his pig stolen from him. His search for his pig would take him back to the city where his past and the world he lived before would be unraveled.

The film's title seemed so ordinary and not inspiring enough, though its simplicity would definitely garner curiosity among viewers. It was this particular approach that was perhaps the film's best factor. Along Robin's journey to finding his pig, bits of pieces of information about his past were revealed. This allowed the film to subtly do a world building. Who could have imagined that chefs and people from the food industry have their own underworld similar to those mafia and assassin's from John Wick? Only this time there were no guns and violent death matches. While the film is nowhere identical to John Wick, it still managed to keep its core story and development all throughout. The theme of human's need for personal connection was greatly presented by the writing. The story went beyond the simple premise of finding a pet pig just because it can help finding those valuable truffles. No, it was because the pig was personally important to the character played by Cage. It may be silly and cheesy to some, but it was undeniably relatable.

Nicolas Cage carried the movie in an inspiring performance. Some of his past films seemed like they were made for TV, and despite his acting prowess he could not make the film interesting. But in Pig, Nicolas Cage did not do guns blazing action, but instead through his gruff old voice he delivered the most penetrating lines. Despite him looking old and beaten, his character's presence and reputation demands respect, and he managed to exude that same presence. Along with Nicolas Cage was Alex Wolff who portrayed Amir. Amir's role at first seemed dispensable and nothing too important. But as the film went by, Amir's role in the film was not just important but essential. He was the one who carried the audience through the story. Alex Wolff played the part complimenting Cage's.

The scenes at the Eurydice restaurant and the climax were masterfully crafted. The exchange between Robin and Derek was too good to be dismissed. Robin's reaction to finding what happened to his pig was emphasized with the deafening lack of anything to hear. Those choices in the film were good and it solidified the emotions that the audiences should feel. Overall, Pig was both very straightforward yet ambiguous that the audience are allowed to interpret the film on their own.",7.0,4 August 2021

CAGE CLOSED,"Is this the movie year of the pig, or the year of the fungi? Yes, yes it is.

Nic Cage never looked worse. Hair is long and matted. Scruffy beard hiding his face. Collecting scrapes and bruises and cuts that map his mug as the movie trudges on. He's never looked worse, and he's never been better.

After years in B-movie wilderness, much of it quite grand in the manic, out of control demonic thespian sense, Nicolas Cage returns in perhaps his most restrained performance. It is all glances, silent pauses, old man groans and whispery words. And even when crap happens, the only fist clenched rage comes from the viewing audience.

There's a lovely, comedic foodie aspect to this weirdo film noire tale, presented as a three course menu. So, very cool. A Baroque cinematic experience, full of deep reddish browns, shadowy portraits, exquisite detail, cartoonish characters, and scenes that beg for a scratch and sniff card (for better or worse).

A dishevelled hermit in a wooden shack even his pig knows a wolf could blow down, Rob survives by collecting expensive, hip resto delicacy fungi with the guidance of his clever companion: The Truffle Pig! The backstory of this existence is murky, with only a few clues pointing to some kind of personal trauma. ""Pig"" slowly unravels a past Rob is uneasy to reveal, let alone revisit. His forced return to civilization is full of quirky tangents and story lines, altercations that surprise as well as incrementally clarify.

As Amir, the truffle go-between dealer kid with a flashy yellow Camaro, a cocky attitude and wild-eyed disbelief, Rob's reluctant conduit to city life, Alex Wolf concocts some wonderful, odd-ball buddy-buddy chemistry, and a semblance of nervous, neurotic normalcy when matters grow out of hand.

This is a small film (yes), with small ideas (maybe not), that flows in unexpected and startling directions (most welcome). Full of emotional angst and suffocating confrontations, it doesn't shy away from brutal violence, but save for one shattering scene, never allows the main character to stray from his messianic, martyr demeanour.

Good if a little pretentious in places,"'Pig' is a relatively short and compelling film with interesting character dynamics.

It gives you something to think over, although it's not that packed with ideas. Some of the dialogue is also pseudo-philosophically pretentious, but not in a way that ruins the whole film.

The acting was fine. Cage was ok by Cage standards (the new-age Cage, not the 2000s insane Cage).

This one is of those films where not that much happens, but it still leaves you with a new emotion or a thought. So I'd instead recommend one to watch it. It has some nice shots, references, ideas. It's 100% Cage's story, but seeing how he affects the lives of other people is engaging.

"Half a ""Masterpiece"" is no ""Masterpiece.""","I'd like to quote the review by ggulcher16 October 2005 who reviewed ""A Tale of Two Sisters"": Half a ""Masterpiece"" is no ""Masterpiece.""

I know there are people who are willing to ""work with"" this movie - I too really, really wanted this to be a great movie, ""a masterpiece"" as so many are willing to call it, and I think a lot of people gloss over the horrible incoherence of the story precisely because they want so bad for it to be ""a masterpiece."" But wishing won't change the facts, or as the great lyricist and percussionist Mr. Peart put it: ""You can twist perceptions / reality won't budge."" And incidentally, I think a review is only as worthwhile as its honesty - I flatly refuse to sugar-coat a lame movie for the sake of ""Useful"" votes.

I sought this movie out specifically because I'd read a number of reviews talking about a ""masterpiece"" with ""a stunning surprise ending."" I have to say it's been a long, long time since I've been this disappointed - no, this utterly disgusted - with a film.

Yes, ""Tale of Two Sisters"" has a certain sense of style, the cinematography is rich and well-photographed throughout, the acting is very good, the dialog is well done - though certainly not outstanding in any of those elements. The story, unfortunately, is an incoherent, unresolved mess. ""Surprise"" indeed.

Along with the positive technical aspects listed above, I think the reason people are so willing to shower ""Tale of Two Sisters"" with the comically-undeserved label of ""masterpiece,"" is the same reason people give historic figures like Kant, Hegel and the like the label of ""great thinkers."" If you say something nonsensical enough and wrap it up in a slick enough veneer, you will invariably find plenty of people who will be willing to confuse incoherence with profundity. In other words, ""I don't understand it, therefore it must be deep."" I say: That there emperor is buck nekkid (butt naked?).

An essential requirement of good storytelling is to maintain a solid logical framework no matter what plot twists, misdirections, red herrings or stylistic deceptions you may weave into it. ""Tale of Two Sisters"" is a game of logical 52-pick-up. It starts with a promising setup but in the midst of the plot-thickening process refuses to lock into a coherent, final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions. Instead the writer tosses half a dozen possible explanations skyward, lets them drop in a random, clattering jumble, then hastily flips out the lights and runs for the door."" Unquote

This is exactly what I felt when I've tried my best to sit through watching this ""Pig"". I really don't know what's the main purpose of making this movie. It's actually quite pretentious and pointless to me.

"It may seem strange, but it's certainly worth watching","Nicolas Cage is known for being in some pretty wacky movies, so when I learnt about the plot of Pig, I immediately assumed it'd be some crazy film to laugh at. I'm actually pleasantly surprised by this film; it isn't a 9/10 or a 10/10 film, it certainly is good, but it's not a masterpiece as some may say. It's an emotional story and it achieves that, especially by the end of the film.

What makes it so good is Nicolas Cage's acting. So many people underrate Cage's acting skills, but the guy literally won an Oscar. His performance here is legendary, and I don't care what anyone else says, it's Oscar-worthy. The acting in general is also very impressive.

I found this film to also be very well paced. It's extremely consistent and I feel like the runtime is perfect. The cinematography and mood of the film really work well together here: creating a sad and somewhat hopeless atmosphere. The makeup and costume design is also great.

This is a simple film, it achieves what it has to achieve. It's not supposed to give you this mind-blowing experience.

"Pig Exemplifies a Lot of Things, And Vengeance Isn't One.","""We don't get a lot of things to really care about""

In the recent past, Nicolas Cage might have given few shocks in regards to his bizarre and undeterred script choices; but one couldn't repudiate the charm and fidelity he brings to the table every freaking time. Yet again, Mr. Cage flaunts instinctive competence and ingeniously consummated this entire execution on his lone shoulders. Needless to say, this was his time to shine, and Boy Oh Boy! Didn't he rose to the occasion!

Storywise, Michael Sarnoski's 'Pig' exemplifies a lot of things, and Vengeance isn't on that list! Unlike some contemporary tales with comparable narrative setups; it rather advocates Humanism, Leniency, and the imperative resilience of mortal minds to dissociate oneself from emotional instability so that we, as human beings could finally embrace our peace of mind.

A compendium of some thought-provoking connotations, that can be found deep underneath its core conception. Wherein the principle of 'less is more' becomes all the more prevalent. A righteous narration that solicits viewers' full attention and does everything in its power to hold on to the same.

Whether it be the astonishing piece of Cinematography that signifies its artsy representation or the sumptuous Score that intuitively alleviates our hearts and souls; It is an indisputable fact, that it is indeed the technicalities that have immensely helped in terms of building up the much-needed ambiance as well as a certain sense of Isolation that remains resolute.

There's a state of dejection in here that utters, or should I rather say; cries in deafening silence. As desolation and despair slowly take over; we end up with an inexplicable sensation that all boils down to individual interpretations and personal understandings.

For me, 'Pig' is an existential, contemplative humane drama that plays with our hopes and anticipations only to subvert them in the latter stages. Aptly enunciating the ideology of Nonviolence through such guileful and deceptive stance from the Director, which to be honest, is going to be demoralizing to many but for some, it would be a great deal of pleasure.",7.0,19 August 2021

Expect the unexpected.,"A film about Nick Cage and a Pig. Doesn't sound great does it. With Nick Cage, you can never quite tell what to expect though. I'm pleased to report that this isn't as bonkers it might sound or could be with Cage. Here he plays Rob, a frazzled looking outdoorsman living with his truffle hunting pig in the Oregon wilderness. Now let me say right at the start, this is one very cute pig. She's covered in sandy coloured fur and has bags of personality... for a pig. We're engineered to like her and Rob. We don't like Amir (Alex Wolff), at least I don't. He brings chaos, more than he realises, but he'll have chance to redeem himself. When Pig is stolen, it's genuinely gut wrenching and Rob finds himself back in Portland, facing his past to restore his future. Rob is slow, purposeful, methodical. The film matches his tempo and it's full of surprises. Without ever losing its authentic edge we skirt through the seedy underbelly of the city and a world that Rob needs to navigate in his zen-like way to restore his peaceful and tranquil existence. For all it's dark and dirt, it's beautifully shot. Appreciative of its location, it's colour, it's climate. Cage is brilliant. Impressively understated where required. Adam Arkin as the bad guy nemesis almost steals the show, but this is Cage's film and despite its twists the goal is simple, ""We're getting my pig back"". Bleak and dramatic, never really funny but oddly entertaining. It's full of heart, I mean full to the brim... and the pig is cute.",7.0,8 November 2021
Pretty but Nonsense,"This movie wants so badly to be deep and artsy to the point of boredum. From a dull drawnout story, to constant monologs, to every character crying, to un-needed chapters, it just wants you to think its the most arthouse movie you've seen. It's shot well, acted well, and edited well but the script and direction is just laughable. By the end of the movie, you're just hoping something will happen. Nothing ever does. The dialogue verges on funny and meaningless, much like the rest of the film.

It's a movie you'll forget about in a week. With a really bad movie you can often find enjoyment. This movie is just lifeless.",5.0,15 December 2022
"Deceptively simple, yet so much more","The set-up of PIG is a bit of a deke. It feints that it will be a simple story of a lonely backwoods truffle hunter and his prized animal, and it is - to a point - but it becomes much more. The farmer is Rob (Nicolas Cage) who is living off the grid in the Northwest with his pig. Every week, a hotshot, Amir (Alex Wolff) drives from Portland and barters with Rob in exchange for his truffle harvest.

Circumstances lead Rob to force Amir to take him to the big city and they see the less sunny side of the Foodie community of Portland. The restaurants tout Rob's truffles as a delicacy. ""Locally grown"" gourmet gold. Slowly, the mismatched pair reveal themselves, especially when they come in contact with the current food scene guru, Darius (Adam Arkin; particularly strong here).

Writer-Director Michael Sarnoski (an additional co-story credit is given to Vanessa Block) has shaped the screenplay to lead one to expect a violent confrontation involving Rob (and there is some), but, it's clear that it's another misdirection for the most part. Cage is effective in a brooding low key manner. Still, his reputation for explosive manic performances plays well here for it unconsciously keeps the viewer off-balance. One knows that Rob will be capable of just about anything. He's dangerous.

Sarnoski and Cage create a resonant tale about food, the meaning of work, memory and, yes, a man and his pet. There are some lumpy, awkward points along the way, but PIG is prized possession indeed.",,27 July 2021
A contemplative drama with good performances,"This movie is truly a vehicle for its star, Nicolas Cage. Though not his first serious role, it allows him to show off more of his talent that everyone kind of knows is there. The nuanced acting all around carries the movie through and is made more prominent by the calm pacing that values atmosphere and character above all else. The plot is really simple--in every way a compliment: just a man looking for his pig. While comparisons to John Wick are obvious, Wick is definitely more fast-paced and an action-based thriller whereas moments in Pig remind me of Kelly Reichardt's marvelous First Cow. I feel Pig does a good job of satisfying both Nick Cage fans and film fans, thanks to the no-nonsense charm and likability that Cage has built up throughout his career.

The writing values character more than action and falls more into the ""drama"" category, though not without its funny moments. The tone is not as dark as one might expect, with the themes, of the movie being hopeful and grounded in humanity. There are a couple of good, grounded monologues from Cage while Wolf does a good job of reacting to him and showing character growth, as he seems to be picking a lot of interesting roles these days and is truly an up-and-coming star to watch out for.

All in all, one of the better movies of 2021 and something to relax to, with perhaps another Oscar nod for Cage in the near future.",7.0,24 August 2021
Beware not a john wick,Most people would think it as revenge story as john wick and would be searching for action violence but this one is totally different and on another level . This one has deep emotions and heart whelming story. A great writung and acting as well.,7.0,22 September 2021
Excellent...but misunderstood,"I think this movie gets a bad rap. When you think 'Nick Cage: going after people who stole his truffle pig' You are probably expecting John Wick with some extra over the top stuff...you aren't getting that here and I think that's expectation/presentation could ruin this movie.

This movie has a lot more heart and a lot more warmth than I expected. Trying to write a synopsis for this film is difficult but essentially what it comes down to is: 'A recluse returns to the city to retrieve his stolen truffle pig and is reminded of his past and how he inspired others.' Really that's the movie; there is also some cooking involved.

If you come to this movie knowing what it is, you will see how underappreciated it is. It's a simple story, but Nicholas Cage is in top form when it comes to acting. And the cinematography is excellent. So many people want an original film but overlook something because it gets a bad reputation since it was marketed incorrectly.

I enjoyed it, Cage delivers, and also the rest of the cast. The story makes you feel things, and think about loss and what that might do to people and how we deal with it.

I'm looking for my pig.,"Aren't we all, Mr. Cage?

A combination of too many wives and bad accounting got Nicholas Cage, who has always been a fine actor, into trouble with the IRS. He spent the last decade toiling in the vineyard of films so bad that his face became the symbol of memes so bad that ""NOT THE BEES!"" makes every millennial laugh.

He now returns with a film that could have easily fallen into the same category without his skill. He is a man who has lost his pig (his ""truffle pig""). He launches into a search for him, where we expect him to become John Wick. Instead, he shows us a man so broken by grief that the only revenge he wants is on himself.

Cage understands what the millennials think about him. He understands what we think about him. He is willing to show us the blood and scars he earned toiling in the vineyards to say it's how he learned who he is. He doesn't care what we think. He KNOWS who he is. He paid his dues, his debts and a whole lot more.

I hope he is rewarded for his efforts by studio system who threw him away, but I don't hold out much hope.

And neither does he,",7.0,15 January 2022

PIG - **** out of *****,"It's not exaggeration to say that this is one of the strangest and most oddly hypnotic 90 minutes I've spent throughout my decades of movie-going. Had someone told me two years ago that a movie featuring Nicolas Cage searching for a kidnapped pig would prove to be not only a career high point for Cage but also among the most memorable movies of its year, well, I would have bet the farm against it. But lo and behold, we have a modern day Aesop's fable here, and its power only intensifies after the ending credits roll and you think back over what you just experienced. Cage really is revelatory here, in easily his best performance since at least ADAPTATION 20 years ago. It's a refreshing reminder that when he drops the over-the-top shenanigans of 98% of is work, he hasn't lost his touch. I'm over-the-moon impressed with the filmmakers who conceived and brought to life such an original piece of work - I guarantee you've never seen anything like it. When I heard this described, I imagined a JOHN WICK-esque action pic, but nothing could be further from the truth. And I think I'll just leave it at that, as discussing anything more would be unfair. This will most certainly not be everyone's cup of tea, but boy oh boy, for those in search of something different besides the normal multiplex Marvel movie, you might find yourself in for a treat.

Other actors have also delivered quite a performance. The story itself could have been more polished and intrigued and so does the screenplay.

I'm not a person who likes the spiritual kind of stuff, but this movie makes me feel okay about grief. It's such a calm movie. It really isn't that long, and yet it feels like it's taking all the time to tell you that loss is going to find you and there's nothing wrong about it. Nic Cage acts in such a way that we already feel the acceptance of what is inevetable in life and translates it to the screen. And even if you haven't felt what the movie is all about, you'd already get a sense of that feeling. I saw it before I lost someone dear to me, and after I lost that person I already could relate to everything this movie is trying to tell.

Do yourself a favor and watch this movie which deals with the real human characters. It is such a rewarding break from the cacophony of CGI constructed trash that Hollywood keeps churning out.

"A riveting performance by Nicholas Cage, he wants his pig back !","My first impression of the movie is that it is a rip off of "" John Wick"" or even "" Taken"" but with a kidnapped pig but it isn't so, because it is not about vengeance, confrontation and mayhem but about loss, grief, pain, sorrow and trauma.

Nicholas Cage playing ex chef Robin delivers a riveting performance as a recluse on a self imposed exile in the wilderness near Oregon where he uses a she pig to locate truffles and these are collected weekly by truffle buyer Amir ( Alex Wolff ). Apparently Robin has not seen a shower for some time and with long uncombed hair he is unkempt, dishevelled and untidy as we see him performing his daily chores all alone in the first few minutes of the movie.( Think ""as dirty as a pig"", and with Nicholas Cage's shabby appearance, is there some sort of symbolism here ?).

Robin is jerked out of his peace when his pig is kidnapped one night leaving him wounded.

From then onwards his life 's mission is to get his pig back as he travels with Amir to Portland city after 15 years of isolation.

Director Michael Sarnoski has a typically individualistic style which is slow burn and gloomy with long duration shots ( silent too) with a static camera. The film unravels at a leisurely pace. There are three slow developing scenes around a dining table with food being served, where little is said and the tension is palpable. There are a few detailed shots of cooking. Not exactly fare for universal audiences who may find it slow and boring.

The highlight of the movie ( or maybe the saving grace) is undoubtedly the superb acting of Nicholas Cage who successfully coveys the pain and rage of someone who is grieving the absence of a dear one ( so what if it is a pig). His piercing gaze is chilling as he says "" I want my pig back"". Nicholas has already picked up a number of well deserved awards. Maybe he'll get an Oscar too.",7.0,3 February 2022
"Affecting, If More Slight Than It Wants To Be","I avoided this for a time, largely out of my stubborn ambivalence about Nicolas Cage in a moment when he seemed to me to be getting an outsized amount of praise. I also didn't really know what the film is; where it fits, when to watch it. I'm glad to have finally seen it; it's most movingly about grief, and the attachments we form and break when grieving. It's also fairly clearly about food, and especially our relationship to the raw ingredients that become our meals. Cage is excellent, but the rest of the characters seemed a little too underwritten. It could have been more - it felt like Leave No Trace covered some similar ground much more powerfully for me.

A meaningful yet difficult film about the demons of one's past,"Nicolas Cage's newest project, PIG, sounds like a typical Cage B-movie with one look at the plot description. Cage plays a truffle hunter isolated in the Oregon wilderness who must return to his past in the city of Portland once his prized truffle pig is stolen from him. While the plot is admittedly ridiculous, this film has far more on its mind then just being a revenge movie similar to John Wick. It instead is focused on being a meditative drama about grief, confronting the demons of one's past, and attempting to move on with life. It doesn't necessarily succeed at being an emotional and engaging narrative, but in the end the meaning resonates enough to justify the short watch.

While many people are raving about Cage's performance here, I felt that the highlight of this movie is Alex Wolff, who also has the most well-built character arc of the narrative. The core of the movie is clearly meant to revolve around Cage and the uncovering of his past, but I found myself attached to Wolff's character/performance and his struggles far more. Both characters are recovering from relationships in their past that haunt them, and they both find themselves staring the troubles in the face through the course of the search for the pig. The main reason this movie works is due to the meaning that is eventually uncovered regarding Cage's mysterious past and of the pig itself.

What prevents this film from being the emotional masterpiece it wants to be is the pacing and presentation of plot elements. For most people, PIG will be just a series of weird culinary-related excursions that add up to a deeply unsatisfying ending. While the deeper meaning behind all of these odd events is the true message, I only processed the point once the movie finished. Because of this, it was impossible for me to truly feel the emotion behind the grief and heartbreak while I was viewing it.

However, PIG could be successfully analyzed for its literary motifs for days on end, which may be what director/writer Michael Sarnoski was aiming for regardless. This is definitely not a film for everyone, but those who want a deep and thought-provoking experience that may not always make sense will find meaning here.

Challenging Genre,"As the movie progresses, we get to know the character that was presented to us as a nobody, and we learn he has a past and a reputation. A voyage of thorough discovery of a hermit, played by Nicolas Cage, who begins a journey in search of his stolen pig. Beautifully shot with aesthetic photography, the movie is a masterclass in genre subversion. There is a constant challenge to the discursive dynamics of revenge films, with freshness and unexpectedness as a direct result. Pig is a love letter to cinema that works as an argument against what our prejudice might tell us, and one in favor of a personal introspective look.",7.0,16 February 2024
Oscar-winning Cage returns for a meditation on grief,"This film is the drama version of John Wick, whereas instead of hitting people with bullets, he hits them with truth bombs! The often dimly lit, range of panning shots and slow cuts lead to a naturalistic feel as the film weaves between a divisions of parts from cottagecore to a shady, mafia-type underworld of the restaurant industry. Focused on loss, but also human connection and redemption, even the arrogant side-kick for this most unlikely of buddy-cops in the pursuit of a lost pig end up being fully fledged characters in a work that may be Cages best in recent history, with a somewhat restrained, morose performance. I found this surprisingly moving tail of personal tragedy compelling, intriguing and emotive as I got enwrapped in the communities portrayed within the narrative, with moments of understated humour providing much needed release. A sleeper hit if I ever saw one, an original film that builds tension well and makes it onto my top ten movies for 2021.",8.0,27 September 2021
In the uncanny valley beteen real and unreal,My problem with it is that it is not clearly meant to be fantasy (e.g. John Wick) but it is too far fetched to be real. Just not sure what its message is. How everyone in portland knew where the pig was is also unexplained.,6.0,8 August 2021
Nicholas Cage's best film in years,"The film begins with the hero, Cage's quiet and introverted woodsman Rob, in a cabin with his pig, who is referred to only as Pig. We see them hunting for truffles together, and we watch Rob doting on Pig and cooking up mushrooms in a pan. Pig appears to have a knack for finding exquisite fungi. A younger man named Amir (Alex Wolff) shows up to buy a haul of truffles. We're given to understand that Amir is Rob's main source of income, but that he doesn't need much because he's committed to living off the grid, communing with nature and nursing a motherlode of grief over a woman. We don't know how he lost her, only that he has audio recordings of her that he can't bring himself to play. And then Pig is kidnapped in the middle of the night, pulled out of the house squealing. Rob is anguished. He wants to go to the nearest big city, Portland, because he's pretty sure that's where she is and he has a vague idea of who might've taken her. Accordingly, ""Pig"" freely commits to a storytelling aesthetic that will be described as slow, digressive, unfocused, and probably a lot other pejoratives by anyone who is not able or inclined to get on its admittedly peculiar wavelength. While conceding that it won't be everyone's, or even most people's, cup of tea, I prefer to accept everything it does with an open mind and heart, because it's so clearly an open-minded and open-hearted film. It's attentive to regret and failure in ways that American films tend to avoid for fear of bumming viewers out and making them warn other people not to watch the movie. And it seems to understand the way people mythologize others and themselves, and the reasons it happens. The world of ""Pig"" is as desolate and cruel as ours, but smaller. Everybody in it seems to know everybody else. And still nobody cares. Except for the hero, who loves his pig. When the movie puts the two characters together in Amir's car, or on a street where we can appreciate the actors' extreme height difference, they become a classic comedy team: Rob the grizzled old prospector and Amir the urban neurotic, looking for a pig in the city. Even though it was shot in 2019, the sensibility of ""Pig"" is that of a mid-1970s picaresque character study about smart, sad guys living on the fringes-the kind of film that would have featured lens flares and zooms and slow-motion montages of people frolicking, and perhaps a harmonica-centric score by Henry Mancini.",10.0,20 April 2023

Direction and cinematography were good, if you count out couple of unnecessary shaky camera shots. Nicolas Cage is truly fantastic as the caring, but somewhat nihilistic truffle hermit and Alexander Wolff does very well in a supporting role.

A profound movie centered around loss and loneliness.,"The moniker ""John Wick with a Pig"" is probably the silliest way to get people intrigued to watch this movie. It's also misleading, which is why some people are left disappointed, wanting to see a merciless bloodbath on par with the Saw movies. In lieu of that, we can't forget about Nicolas Cage, whose movies such as Vampire's Kiss, Face/Off, The Wicker Man, Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans gives us an idea of what we are getting into, another movie where he acts a fool and a ridiculous premise that surrounds it. I went to the theater expecting that. Instead, I watched a film that had the profound ability to teach, not entertain. And that's the surprise that I got. And I loved it.

Nicolas Cage portrays a former chef who became burnt out trying to please people, and decided to do what he wants to do. He forages truffles with help from his best friend, a cute sow who becomes the only thing he truly cares about in life. Now that one thing has been taken away from him is out in a place he really doesn't want to go back to. There's your premise. You really have to open your heart up throughout the movie. Yes there is violence. Yes there is dramatic irony. Yes it is gritty. These are the things that people expect from modern day movies. Except this movie took those expectations and subverted them into something people wouldn't expect. And it paid off. That's why this movie is great. Go see it.",10.0,20 July 2021

A Feast for Arthouse Cinema Fans from the Pacific Northwest but a Tedious Affair for Neutral Spectators from Everywhere Else,"Nicolas Cage is one of my favourite American actors. Ironically, several of his most recent performances have received dreadful critical reviews while I happened to enjoy several of them, most notably Mandy, Color Out of Space and Willy's Wonderland. Pig on the other side has received excellent critical acclaim and is often described as a return to form or even comeback for Nicolas Cage but I find said movie to be slightly above average at best.

The movie revolves around Rob who is living as a recluse in a trailer in the wilderness of Oregon. His only contact to the outside world is through young businessman Amir. Rob has a pig that helps him finding truffles that he then sells to Amir. One fateful night, Rob gets assaulted by a group of gangsters who kidnap his beloved pig. Rob nurses himself back to health and then asks Amir to help him find his beloved pig. Amir initially looks down ob Rob, makes fun of him and doesn't take his quest seriously at all. However, Amir soon learns that Rob has an impressive past in Portland and that the kidnapping of the pig might actually be related to Amir's pitiless father.

This movie convinces on several levels. First of all, Nicolas Cage's acting style is authentic, charismatic and gripping from start to finish. The story line of the movie seems quite intriguing and leads to an ending that is rather philosophical than vengeful as some viewers might expect. The numerous different locations in Oregon ooze with atmosphere and portray the clash between bright and shady sides very well.

On the other side, this film isn't without its flaws. After a dynamic start, the movie loses much pace in the middle section and drags on for far too long. The film focuses on the protagonist revisiting his past as he goes to his old house, lectures a former colleague and reluctantly meets an old friend. The movie feels as if it were made up of several episodes that don't really connect while losing track of the main plot. The conclusion to the story feels anticlimactic. While the film's ending certainly walks off the beaten path, it also feels a little bit forced and made me roll my eyes with a sigh rather than impressing me with its twisted wit.

At the end of the day, there are numerous contemporary movies featuring Nicolas Cage that deserve as much or even more attention that Pig. This film here is interesting for fans of arthouse cinema from the Pacific Northwest. Neutral spectators will however come to the conclusion that this drama is only just above average and has almost as many flaws and strengths.",6.0,25 April 2022
Story Was Ok But The Nicolas Cage Was Excellent,"Pig is a drama and thriller. The story is real, authentic, touching, and emotional. Such Individual movies are known as ""Cinema"" and are the building blocks of the Hollywood Industry. Such movies aren't considered worthy of watching and praising just because they don't belong from a Franchise or Studio.

I love watching such movies but only a few movies touch me deeply in this genre like Joker 2019 and the Pursuit of Happiness were my favorite individual movies.

I watched this movie but I didn't find its story epic. Yes, it was a good and decent story but as I said that in this genre, only a few movies can touch my heart but unfortunately pig wasn't among all that.

But But But... the character of Nicolas Cage is just amazing in this movie and an Oscar-winning character. His character development was too good and his performance was just excellent. I would only suggest you watch this movie for Nicola's performance.

The scene where the protagonist was confronting a specific character in a hotel was outstanding. It's an emotional story of a man dealing with his past and present loss. You would love it if you love such poetic movies. But this movie isn't for everyone.",6.0,28 July 2021
Unexpected - beautiful - exquisite,"I've had admittedly high expectations. The premise is intriguing, and the casting of Nicolas Cage had me sold. He's made some great career decisions in the past several years, and some fantastic movies. I've wanted to see 'Pig' so much that, for the first time since the onset of COVID-19, I ventured to a movie theater to see it.

'Pig' is the first full-length feature of writer-director Michael Sarnoski, and of co-writer Vanessa Block. It's a quiet, subdued tale, punctuated by scarce moments of outburst. And, much to my amazement, in my opinion it's told with the expertise of a seasoned veteran.

This might well be one of the best movies I've ever seen.

The movie is about a man looking for his kidnapped pig, but it is just as much a movie about a man revisiting a past that torments him, and it's utterly fascinating. Sarnoski reveals protagonist Rob's history ever so slyly, with understated suggestions woven into dialogue, shared looks, or even just a simple shot from the camera. Rob is a deceptively complex character, realized with phenomenal contributions from wardrobe, makeup, and hair - and with a lead performance that may possibly be one of the very best of Nicolas Cage's career.

Like other notable roles of recent times - 'Mandy,' 'Color out of space,' 'Willy's Wonderland' - 'Pig' marks a feature rather off the beaten path for Cage. Like those other notable roles, Cage gives an outstanding performance contravening the long period where he starred in many less celebrated films. Unlike those other notable roles, 'Pig' demands of Cage not the exuberant, bombastic vigor of a man going wild - but the reserved, hollowing sorrow of a man out of reach. And he excels. For all the less than stellar parts Cage has taken on in the past, they belie an exceptional talent that comes out at the most unexpected times. This is masterful.

Co-star Alex Wolff is entirely unknown to me heretofore, but he demonstrates a range and capability I never could have anticipated. His supporting role as Amir requires considerable underhanded nuance, and he pulls it off very convincingly. I'll be keeping my eye on him from now on.

'Pig' opens peacefully in the deep, lush, gorgeous forests of Oregon, and immediately conveys a mood at once muted, soft, and sullen. That tone persists throughout the feature, nearly uninterrupted. The most vivid scenes, rife with tension and simmering emotion, are filled not with action or suspense but with swell dialogue - generally revealing still greater truths about Rob's history and character. One of the most captivating scenes of all is the wordless preparation of a meal. Through it all, the attention to detail is considerable, but natural, never feeling pointedly deliberate. Every individual in the story has unseen depths, and no matter how small the part, the cast inhabits them all very well, and believably. Everything in 'Pig' feels very wonderfully real.

The original score composed by Alexis Grapsas and Philip Klein is marvelous. It never overwhelms the rest of the film, yet complements every mood, in every scene, perfectly. This goes as well for the classical pieces, and select popular songs, that dot the soundtrack at psychological moments. If there is any one place where the music feels dominant, it's in the final scene, where Grapsas and Klein's stirring chords reap the emotional seeds Sarnoski has been sowing - and where a final simple song, with one acoustic guitar and one voice, fades into the credits with a deeply affecting yet serene melody.

There's a shakiness to the camerawork that is unwelcome, but it never is so severe as to disrupt our viewing experience. At all times we're so entranced by the story being told, the visuals on hand, and the fantastic dialogue, that all other thoughts all but drop away. Set design and decoration is impeccable. Sound is perfect. For as hushed in tone as 'Pig' is overall, the emotional ambience is forceful in its tangibility: We keenly feel the grief, melancholy, and pain, portrayed most substantially in Rob's countenance yet still otherwise pervasive. At the same time, there is a lingering, haunting beauty to it all - a tumultuous mixture of sentiments as complicated as life itself.

I anticipated enjoying 'Pig,' but never in my wildest dreams would I have thought the first movie I've seen in theaters in almost 1.5 years would be this astoundingly good. It's so carefully, lovingly written, and directed, and acted, that I cried more than once. I've seen other debut features from film-makers and been impressed, but Michael Sarnoski has totally blown me away with his craft, just as Nicolas Cage has with his.

This is the opposite of a blockbuster, with a low-key tenor that will be off-putting for general audiences. Yet for anyone who is receptive to more restrained, unobtrusive pictures - movies that are thoughtful, focused on emotional weight, reliant on dialogue - this is essential. This is a must-see. 'Pig' is a treasure beyond almost all comparison, and I absolutely cannot wait to see it again.",10.0,16 July 2021
Above Average,"I really believe that this is a well acted and well directed movie, but it's a movie than didn't make an impact on me. I might see it a second time in the future, but my main gripe is this. Also, it's one of Nicolas Cage's best performances in years.",6.0,26 July 2021

Pig,"Nicholas Cage lives in isolation in the middle of nowhere with his truffle hunting pig. When the pig is stolen, Cage goes back to his roots where he was a master chef, with the help of his truffle buyer Alex Wolff to track it down.

Definitely a film to toy with your expectations, this is a existential tale looking at life's priorities as seen through the eyes of Cage, Wolff and 'bad guy' Adam Arkin. It is largely free of violence and features some gentle ideas and monologues delivered by a strong cast, particularly Cage who atypically demonstrates that shouting what you want to say is not the only way of communicating. So let the viewer beware - this is a quiet, rather sweet life study more akin to Ratatouille than John Wick.",6.0,26 January 2022
Where's my pig?,"When people think of Nicolas Cage they usually think insane over the top acting, but he is also a serious actor. Pig is one of those examples of taking a trip back to that other perspective of the cage man. Nicolas Cage plays a truffle hunter who lives out in the woods of Oregon with his pet pig,far away from the troubles of the city. He sells truffles to a local city dealer on the side. One night his pig is stolen by mysterious folk and now he must travel to the city to find her. Nicolas Cage gives one of his best films in recent years as this very dry serious mountain man. Who at the same time he does deliver humor still the same although it's quite more subtle. One of the examples being is that he doesn't change his clothes this entire film he's just going to all these places looking like this. However from the description of the film and how it's portrayed in the trailers many assume this is more of a John Wick style film only with a pig instead of a dog. It's worth noting that's really not the case. It's not an action film it's a drama of a man determined to go through all these step and personal hurtles regardless of what others might think. It's more of a man coming to terms with his past and chases want little disillusion he has left.",7.0,20 August 2021

Go into this movie with the right expectations and you'll enjoy it much more.",8.0,22 December 2021
John Wick but it's a PIG! PSYYYYYCHE!,"Pig 7/10 and I debated giving this a 8/10.

Nicholas Cage is a great actor and it is very easy to forget that these days with a movie of his coming out seemingly every week and usually not of the highest value. More to the point is the last movie Nicholas Cage made before ""Pig (2021)"" Willy's Wonderland, a movie I would recommend far less than Pig; Pig is actually a great movie.

It's a sad movie, a somber movie. A movie about loss, other people's expectations and being afraid to face your own pain. The movie is perfectly paced at 91 minutes and breaks the film down, literally, into 3 parts. It never lingers to long in a scene and keeps you guessing at the right moments. The actual pig in the movie is a metaphor but also a straight and narrow plot device moving the narrative along. I mentioned earlier that the movie is sad, but thanks to the exceptional pacing the movie is not miserable.

Watching the trailer for Pig having it star Nicolas Cage coupled with the tagline ""I'm looking for a truffle pig"" with ominous music makes you think you are about to watch the Nicolas Cage version of John Wick, but instead of a dog being the revenge plot it's a pig!

He's never been gone,"I see a lot of reviewers saying things like ""he's back"". Nicolas Cage hasn't ever been gone, with a lot of his work it's a matter of liking it or hating it, this movie simply reminds us all that he is and has always been a great actor.",8.0,23 August 2021
Surprisingly good...,"""Pig"" is a Drama - Thriller in which we watch a man searching for truffles with the help of a pig when someone kidnaps it and he starts searching for it. He has to return to his past in order to find more information about this kidnap and try to find his pig.

I have to admit that I did not know what to expect from this movie but after watching it I was really surprised by it. It had a nice plot that contained some very good plot twists that made the movie very interesting. The interpretation of Nicolas Cage who played as Rob was very good and a nice surprise for me since I did not expect it to be so good. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Alex Wolff who played as Amir and he supported Nicolas Cage very well. The direction which was made by Michael Sarnoski was good and he did not make anything extra that could ruin his movie and kept it simple. Lastly, I have to say that ""Pig"" is a good movie and recommend you to watch it because it will keep you intense through its whole duration.",6.0,19 November 2021

"Not a fun movie to watch, but I loved it.","Years ago I dragged a friend to see ""Unforgiven'', a masterpiece in my book. She hated it - said it was so slow and boring that she would have exited the theater if it were not for me beside her.

If ""Unforgiven'' was slow-paced, ""Pig"" is glacial in its rollout. There is little action and even less dialogue, but to me it captured an ethos that one can only appreciate if one has experienced a number of life's travails. The pacing is its genius. It insists that you feel what's on the screen.

""Pig"" is about loss and profound disappointment - the loss of loved ones, the loss of one's dreams and ambitions, the loss of youth's shininess - even the loss of wanting to keep living among other people, so disappointing can they be. To certain audience members, it should strike home hard.

Cage, of whom I've never been a fan - I hated Leaving Las Vegas - was terrific in this role. His physical moroseness as the movie moves forward, and the fact that nobody seems to notice it - indeed smell it - becomes wonderfully comical, though there are no overt laugh lines in the 90-minute film. Everything is dark, heavy, and delightfully dispiriting. (I thought the fight scene a bit too much, even contrived.)

I can easily see why some people would hate this film, and I won't be bringing my old friend to see it. But I can also see why others think it brilliant. It's not about entertainment; it's about strained human existence. It captures that beautifully, if not extremely. And what a clever premise. Truffle pigs, go figure.

""Pig"" really stuck with me. It's a movie I'll probably watch a half-dozen times. But I'll be watching it alone. To anyone who doesn't like this genre it will be excruciating.",9.0,17 July 2021

Cage shows again he's a good drama actor.,"The story is quite simple, from start to end.

The cinematography is interesting and together with the score, the atmosphere is well set. I also like the mystery created around Cage's character, who gives a solid performance making this movie better than it would be without.

I like the pace, it's a slow burner drama, but maybe because I was expecting something else, it was a bit disappointing.

The ending was quite anticlimactic to me, it didn't live up to the tension created to the point.

Still, I enjoyed the movie, I found it entertaining and the chemistry between the main characters was interesting.

I have to admit,"I definitely admit I liked this more than I thought that I would. Without spoiling anything, this film is a lot different than you'd expect. It's got some twists and turns!

Wisdom from a tormented chef,"This is a must-see for chefs and foodies. I thought it was an excellent story, subtle but clear and profound.

The low scores probably reflect that expectation.

The script was just right (genuine seeming, not the typical melodramatic or cliché dialog), production perfect, direction thoughtful and surprisingly insightful.

This is only the second 9 I've rated anything. I rate based on the overall quality, starting with a 10 and deducting for noticable flaws like poor sound, acting and so forth. This one was masterfully done. Good work, Nick!",9.0,17 July 2021
"Decent, but too little happening","It seems this movie is very polarizing. I see lots of reviews praising the movie to high heaven, who think the people giving the movie a low score are out of their minds. Then I also see a bunch of reviews damning the movie, who think the people giving the movie a HIGH score are out of their minds. I guess I'm one of very few people who find myself somewhere in the middle. I won't rate the movie with a number, as I'm not sure what to give.

First things first: the ""Thriller"" tag for this movie is a very odd choice indeed. I don't know who put that there, but they must be thinking of a different movie, because there are zero ""thrills"" here. This is purely a drama movvie, through and through. Which is fine, I enjoy a good drama movie, just as I enjoy a good thriller.

The cinematography was excellent. Cage's acting is on point, but the role he plays also doesn't demand that much of him, as he doesn't need to talk much, or break into different ranges of emotion all that often (it does happen though), so I do feel like all the comments in here about an Oscar are a bit of a stretch, but that's just my opinion.

As for the most important part in this type of movie; the drama, well...there are a couple of really good scenes. Most notably, the ""cooking in the kitchen"" scene, and the one immediately after, as a whole. You'll know which ones I'm talking about. But that's the thing, there aren't a whole lot of such scenes, and that in turn brings me to my next, and probably most major point, and that I see a lot (maybe all) of the negative reviews mention as well: there is not a lot happening in this movie. Like I said, I enjoy good dramas, so this isn't about a need for action, or anything like that. But things still need to happen. And this movie didn't have a lot of that.

So basically, I guess, to me, what was there was good, but there needed to be a lot more of it. More story, more plot development, more things happening, more drama scenes. As it stands, the movie can be enjoyable, but it can also become boring because of how there are long stretches of very little happening. Slow can be good, if done right. This one falls a bit short of the mark, imo. Personally, I still enjoyed it somewhat, but how much, I'm not sure. And thus, would I recommend watching it? Not sure about that either.",,31 July 2021
"""Pig"" written by Gregory Mann","""Pig""

""Pig"" tells the story of Robin Feld (Nicholas Cage), a 'truffle' hunter, who lives alone in 'The Oregonian' wilderness. Rob is gifted at caring for animals. When his beloved foraging pig is kidnapped, he must return to his long-abandoned past in Portland in search of his pig, to recover her. He looks more bushy-bearded and hobo-like than usual. He returns to the city to track down the swine, so to speak, who stole his 'truffle' pig. In these dark and uncertain times, at least we can still worship at the church of Rob. In terms of oinktastic cinema the pig faces stiff competition in another film released this year about an even-toed ungulate, which was sow good; the amazing 'Gunda'.

The film chronicles the life of a truffle hunter in crisis; after his pig is kidnapped. Set against the stunning backdrop of 'Oregonian' wilderness, ""Pig"" shows thé search of a small-scale truffle hunter for his beloved pig. Deeply immersive, the film is a poetic snapshot, a contemplation on compassion, ethics, and the changing landscape. In intimate detail, it captures the.hunter's personal upheaval as he questions his own morality and the value of life. 'Truffle' hunters will camp out on their porches at night, shotgun in hand, to fend off competing hunters trying to steal their valuable pigs and dogs. What? That's one of those facts that felt otherworldly yet immediately relatable to us, and that's where ""Pig"" starts. It get us imagining what sort of person would be so attached to their truffle pig that this would be a quest worth following. There's the image of this tattered old man, alone in the woods with only his pig. Where did he come from? Then his world and history starts to unfold around him, and ""Pig"" begins to take shape. And as the story grows, something from our own life inevitably creeped it's way in. It throws us into a state of feeling like the world is a dream.

We're going to wake up from. Everything feels a little like we watching it from outside ourself, and it's hard to fully commit to the reality of the world and other people. We expect the feeling to go away one day, but as we get older, we find it doesn't naturally go away. You just get used to it and integrate it into your worldview. Different people integrate grief into their world in different ways, and it shapes how they see themselves and the people around them. We see this with our own immediate family; how the loss trickles into everyone's life in various ways, and how after many years those ways have just become our disparate realities. Not the immediate effects of grief, but the long-term, perception-defining aspects that weave into our lives and the bedrock of our consciousness. How that can make us build walls around ourselves that separate us from others, even others that are going through the same thing in their own ways. The hunter's' inner reflections share his struggle to align life with values, and through the story's simple intimacy, the hunter's moral quandary quietly becomes our own.

""Pig"" is conceived as a meditation on life, death and personal values. The film is intended as an immersive experience where the viewer shares the character's daily life and growing anxiety. It unfolds unhurriedly, often in real time, immersing the viewer in the life of a truffle hunter. The pace of the film allows time and space to experience one's own thoughts. Quietly, the viewer embarks on an intimate journey of their own. We don't get a lot of things to really care about in this life. For much of our society, there's a huge disconnect between what we eat and the source of that food. The film moves deep into a hipster city's glamorous foodie culture. It's about kitchen staff in the city's fey, foodie-favored fine-dining eateries. Who better to help explore that disconnect, and inspire compassion for all beings, than a truffle hunter experiencing his own evolution of thought? Through it's intimacy, this story has the power to reach an audience that might not have contemplated these issues.

"Flawed but quirky, indie movie worth the effort","I'm in two minds on this movie. On the one hand it's a drawn-out, low-budget movie that can at times be amateurish if not downright silly (chef's fight club? Really?), on the other hand this is an original story of grief, love and longing with a detective plot that outweighs the flaws.

Nicholas Cage's screen presence pulls it all together, though talk of an Oscar is very optimistic. It's not like he needed a lot of range, or even lines, to play a taciturn, stone-faced, grief-crippled loner. But all credit to Cage, he does a fine job in a change-up role from the usual action schlock he does these days.

The plot is an odd mix of backwoods pioneer/city foodie/gangster/detective/porcine romance but all in all, an interesting, quirky, indie movie with moody, wet Oregan and Portland backdrops.",6.0,6 September 2021

A grand Nicolas Cage performance in an uneven film,"Nicolas Cage gives a committed and painstakingly subtle performance (one of his best ever) in this quiet, offbeat drama about a truffle hunter whose peaceful existence is upended when his truffle pig is stolen by mysterious intruders. What follows is a journey into his past in which his story is slowly unpacked.

A brooding aura is present throughout. The cinematography conveys Oregon to be a forlorn and unwelcoming place. Cage almost carries the film. Despite his brilliance, however, he cannot fully salvage a story that is underdeveloped. The underlying themes and metaphors are given a treatment so slight and vague that his protagonist remains something of an enigma in the end.

The film's low-key, nuanced approach is a strength that ultimately turns into a liability. If a character is to be revealed to us slowly, the ultimate payoff cannot be spotty. I applaud the film's many strengths, but because it left me with some questions, I give it only a passing mark. Recommended.",7.0,30 August 2021

A deconstruction of an action movie,"It builds on a familiar premise, John Wick immediately comes to mind, then flips the script to replace gratuitous violence with quiet contemplation. The exercise is admirably subversive, but it comes at the expense of genuine entertainment.

We all know the drill, an aggrieved vigilante seeks vengeance by knocking down doors and taking no prisoners. Except Cage keeps his hero low key, only vanquishing his foes through a stern monologue or a well cooked meal. This is interspersed with themes of loss, both for relationships and past lifestyles. It's well crafted and well acted, so it should land, but given how far they dig in on the minimalism, it becomes easy to loose interest.

The absence of violence is one thing, but even the dramatic angle of the film feels downplayed. How much grief can we feel for characters that never appear on-screen? Cage is given one emotionally impactful moment, but spends the rest of the time in stoic deadpan. It's an effective amount of restraint given his reputation for histrionics, but not an overly fun watch. It was certainly a strange choice to depict the culinary community of Portland as some kind of seedy criminal underbelly, and kind of funny one when you step back, but I can't say I was overly captivated by the notion of high stakes cheffing.

The reversal of action tropes calls into question how much we've come to expect violence to be the solution to all problems. Pig examines the genre by refusing to play by it's rules, and while this may be interesting on paper, ultimately what we're left with is a film that's impressive for what it isn't, but not so much for what it is.",6.0,24 June 2022

The backstory of his stature and fame in the Portland restaurant community would have been so much more interesting to explore. Instead, we're given unsatisfying hints and feints and left feeling that this would have been a great 12-page short story in a well-respected fiction publication. It's just not movie material.

But ""Pig"" is not only about loss, it is a movie about love, loss, life. Nicolas Cage delivers a great performance, inhabiting this unusual character masterfully, and its journey is not to find solace in revenge.

The whole movie is a very well accomplished balancing act that is weird enough to be intriguing and enticing, still managing to have a foot (or at least its toes) on the ground just enough to allow that previous suspension of disbelief. Again, this is accomplished only thanks to great performances from Cage and the rest of the cast, but it is also because the whole thing comes together as whole.

So much going on in such a short time.,"Where do I begin? There were great performances (by everyone): Cage was powerful, but I felt Wolff stole the movie. Arkin, whom I normally don't care for, was perfect. It's not so much a movie about a pig and that was an interesting choice (or as I found out later probably because of budget issues--they could not afford a trained pig). It would have been nice to see the relationship between the pig and Cage's character developed more, they just gave a very brief taste (pardon the pun). Most movies of this nature would have manipulated the hell of that, animals can elicit easy sympathy. This movie didn't. They instead chose to actually rely on the relationships of the people in the film, and surprisingly, for a movie named after an animal, it worked.

For me, this movie was more about a young man seeing his life through the circumstances of a lonely old man: his father, mother, past choices and future possibilities. All of which was made possible by him reluctantly taking the old man on a journey. But there was so much more, depending on where your sensibilities lie. There was an awesome subtle (perhaps not so subtle) criticism of societal obsessions and priorities, in this case--food. It was hilarious. But it also showed the beautiful part of food and how it is the sustenance of life in differing ways.

Suffice it to say, I think there is something in this film for everyone. Even the supporting characters have a story to tell. This review is too long already, so I'll stop here--Bon Appétit!",9.0,21 July 2021

It's things that should have been obvious to us to begin with.

A Really Great Character Study Of Grief!,"Pig

This was a very strange movie seemingly about a reclusive truffle hunting man and his pig, eeking out a meagre existence in the forest having lost all faith in humanity.

However the movie was carefully crafted, revealing slowing the pulleys and drivers with this man that had led to his present reality.

Without revealing the plot to much the movie examined grief, integrity, dreams and parenthood, the pig was somewhat important as well lol!

I thought Nicolas Cage was brilliant and brought an intensity to a complex character. Whilst severe, rude and unapproachable, we liked him from the start a very difficult acting trick to pull off!

"Strange at first, excellent by the end.",,9.0,17 July 2021
Everything was great except for the direction.,"First I want to start off this review by saying this movie is most definitely not for everyone. Some of the genres this movie is listed under are highly inaccurate. This isn't a mystery or a thriller at all. This is a slow-burn emotional drama film. So please note that before going into this film that this isn't John Wick esque type of movie. Without giving to much away this movie follows a World Class chef who gave up the high life and instead decided to go into reclusion in the forrest with a pig, who is then stolen from him.

The movie does alot of things well like the visuals which are really stunning, the acting which is excellent, and the plot was good to. Where this movie failed to me is that it is entirely to slow. Also it doesn't have enough exciting or thrilling moments as well as viewer could careless about any of the characters in this film. I understand what the director was trying to convey but it was done poorly. On top of it there were lot of things left unexplained that if explained, could of honestly helped the story along.

Overall it isn't bad watch, I thought the movie was decent. But its most definitely not rewatchable or something memorable. I also personally wouldn't recommemd it unless you're looking to kill some time.",6.0,19 July 2021

Expectation is a b****.,"So if you see a film about a man who lives in the woods with a pig hunting truffles, and the man is Nic Cage, and then someone steals that pig, and Nic Cage wants it back, you know what's gonna happen right?!!!! Well, you're half right. It's refreshing to see a revenge flick that is so different, (although it's not 100% convincing and there are some out of place scenes..... ) But its good aspects far outweigh the bad. The one scene that the film works towards is at first baffling but then clicks and that's very satisfying. But if you want blood and guts then give it a miss. Watch Mandy instead.",7.0,9 April 2022
Pig (2021),"Pig is one of the more bizarre films that I have recently witnessed by far. And man believe me when I tell you that I didn't know what to make of this. In this film, Nicholas Cage plays Rob, a farmer who lives on a farm in the middle of nowhere with his pig. One day his pig gets taken away by an unknown bandit and now it's up to Rob to go and save his pig's life. He is then joined by Amir (played by Alex Wolff) who agrees to help Rob with his quest to go save his pig. Wolff and Cage's acting chemistry in this movie is decent but it just wasn't what I was hoping for. Now I'm not saying that Cage is a bad actor, he's done some great films in his career. This movie just isn't really his best and I didn't think it was that good at all. The plot was okay, the cast was halfway decent, and the acting was very bland.

Nice to see Cage bring it,"I've been a Cage fan for decades, but even I can admit he's played in some pretty abysmal movies. Like Michael Caine, he seems to have a hard time saying no to a script. However, every now and then he reminds us of why he's a great actor. My favorite Christmas movie is ""Family Man,"" but that is another review for another time.

""Pig"" is a dark movie, and like many modern movies it meanders through a myriad of drama to the edge of fantasy, weaving a tale of an existence that borders on improbable, if not impossible. A simple tale, a simple hero, that somehow has a background story that's part ""John Wick"" and part ""Ratatouille.""

That being said. ""Pig"" is an understated beauty of a movie, with inspiring acting, not just from Cage but from. Alex Wolff, a character who loves and hates his parents, childhood and life in general. If you enjoy a movie based entirely on the performance of the actors involved, this movie is a home run for you.",8.0,4 December 2021

I was expecting more of a taken type movie and although we didn't get that I enjoyed what we did get. Cage shoes some real subtleness. He has few lines but still pulls thrill.

A misunderstood story about loss and grief,"Fell head over heels with the cinematography right off the bat until its last frames, positioning itself next to another 2021 production, The Green Knight with Andrew Droz Palermo. Next came Cage's raw, impaling, Oscar-worthy performance. He didn't have the most dialogue but it didn't make him the least bright among the stars. Lastly, the dark, metaphorical narrative on loss and grief. I guess it's the last one the viewers tend to miss, that's why they find the film aimless and boring, when in fact it's the beat of the film's heart.",10.0,12 October 2021
Dull and dreary with a couple stand-out scenes,"Nick Coppola is excellent as always, very understated here, playing a truffle-hunting hermit. The acting all-around is great and is probably the high point of the film. As you slowly learn about these characters you find what ties them together is their miserably sad backstories. No one here in the truffle industry is normal, they are all somehow jaded or ""bent"". They are painted as apart from society, is this a real thing? Did the writer/director watch a Vice documentary on truffle hunters and this was the product?

It's competently made (the scenes of grief and the brief moments of music stand out) but there isn't much in the story to latch on here. There needed to be more to the beginning, an intriguing start sort of repeats and folds in on itself before finally just concluding. A movie about cooking and loss and sadness and pigs... The scene at the first high-end restaurant is excellent and the final scenes finally tie everything together and make this one worth watching. Another bizarre one to add to Cage's repertoire.",6.0,6 November 2021

This movie knew from the very beggining what it wanted to show us and how, and did with surgical precision and excelence. Watching this felt like was watching a proxy which is obscuring the movie itself, and to really see and understand why it is so good I had to realize this.

The movie seemingly slaps you with bizzare environments and people, just to entertain you in a lightly manner, but the real movie is hidden behind and is very normal and emotional.

Movie filled with mystery and very well done camera work only to show you the very mundane emotions of people.

This movie is Cage's very best by far, and I belive this ia a masterpiece.",10.0,27 July 2022
Good but...,Didn't quite have the emotional impact I expected. I wonder if they cut too much. Maybe the pig needed more screen time or we needed to see some flashbacks with Rob's wife instead of just hearing a recording on cassette tape. There were several other things that bothered me which I could have overlooked if I felt an emotional connection. I'm really surprised this movie showed up on so many top ten lists for 2021.

We don't get a lot of things to care about,"Pig is a movie with a fairly simple story, a man who lives with his Pig goes out searching for it. But it conveys a lot more than that, Pig deals with heavy themes like grief, depression, loss. It's definitely one of the best movies of 2021, and it's such a shame that not many people know about it. The fact that this movie sits on a 6.9 rating is sadder still, considering I can't remember the last time I ever felt this emotionally invested in a movie. This movie is definitely Nic Cage's comeback and I highly recommend it to every movie buff out there. It's slow, it's raw, it's gritty.... but in a way of things it's also beautiful. It's hard to completely describe it, so the less said the better.",9.0,12 August 2022
Surrealist Little Fable,"None of the characters feel like real people and that's alright: atmosphere and raw emotion more than make up for the lack of human presence, providing captivating and immersive experience. I have to clarify that the lack of ""human"" characters does not always mean lack of human nature, and the latter is presented in abundance here. It is by no means a deep all-encompassing dive into human condition, but it's a drive-by of it of sorts, and in this day and age, that's enough to earn some praise from me. Vacuous spectacle fatigue worked in this film's favor and I thoroughly enjoyed myself watching it.

Absurdist twists and turns into the city's underbelly along with psychedelic confrontational monologues were most welcome. No joke, the underground fight establishment and the restaurant encounter parts specifically made me feel like I'm WATCHING a surrealist painting come to life.

Everybody was talking about the impending doom of superhero movie fatigue in the early 2010s, it's been a decade and Marvel movies are still among the few films that actually turn a profit, congrats on that - it's always good for a movie that keeps studios afloat to exist rather than not exist. However, there are very few movies that are able to hold my attention, maybe it's part of the ageing process, maybe it's the accessibility-value curve - the more access you have to a thing the less value you put on the thing. In the time of VHS rentals it was unthinkable for me to NOT finish a movie I rented (it happened only once, and I was in shock myself lol), because that was it: you picked it, you paid for it, you brought it home, this is it: it's either this or nothing, so I'd always choose ""this"", even if it was not too interesting; now, with streaming - it's so easy to pick it, to start watching it, then abandon it and go look for another one, that I celebrate and thank any movie that manages to hold my attention throughout its whole runtime.

I used to rate only the films that I saw from start to finish, sometimes giving them one or two stars if I didn't like them, but for the past couple of years I reserve anything below three stars for those that I couldn't bear to sit through, no film that managed to be interesting enough for me to see it in its entirety deserves anything below a three.

Returning to ""Pig"" again, it's impossible to judge it in a vacuum, it exists in the world full of interchangeable action figures going through the motions, so in that context ""Pig"" wins, it's a breath of fresh air in the middle of that visually loud, over-saturated (both literally and metaphorically) vomit of a spectacle that always has the world ending stakes that ends up numbing you to the whole audio-visual sequence entirely. In a different world ""Pig"" wouldn't have earned a review from Me, but in this one it deserves it.

Nicholas Cage carries most of it, which is surprising - throughout the years I always heard people refer to him as a good actor, never felt the same way personally, but this film made me reconsider. He can internalize the character and their experience, the way you see it if you have your actor not doing or saying anything, yet you still see the CHARACTER, that's how you know your actor did it. Cage did it. There is a lot of silence and not-doing in this film and never once do you lose connection to this pig guy.

I never even knocked Cage for doing bad films, not many people realize that in most cases those films wouldn't have been made at all, if it wasn't for Cage. Same story with many former A-list actors doing ""bad"" films: it's not like a ""we have the money, now we need some has-been to headline this"", it's usually ""this has-been agreed to be in this, now we can start asking around for money"", that's star power. So, the conversation about ""oh, how this former A-lister takes hundreds of thousands on the production that pays maybe a couple hundred dollars to this boom mic guy!?!"" is dumb since if it wasn't for the A-lister, the boom mic guy wouldn't have this gig at all. Keep that in mind next time you see Cage is a bad film: Cage is the reason any of these people even get ANY money, and that is the greatest good you can do for someone: pay their bills (provide an avenue for the person to pay them, to be precise).

So, never hated the guy, but seeing him applying the aforementioned star power to a small production of a ""good"" film made me respect him.

The negatives: the ending and the casting of the buyer guy, - he just didn't work for me. It's hard to go head-to-head with Cage, maybe the young chap would've been fine if he didn't have to share screen with an acting heavyweight, but can't expect this film to be able to find a star actor for every role. The ending did spoil the experience a bit while not completely ruining it. As long as the film was going the experience was consistently entertaining, the storytelling remained engaging without any major dips, but once we arrived at the end, it was a let-down. I don't have any suggestions as to what I would've done differently, though, this is someone else's story and that's how they decided to conclude it, no major issues there, just personal preference.

The fact that I didn't see any of the characters as people per se might have helped ease dissatisfaction with the ending. Since they were not people, but emotions feeling each other out and experiencing themselves for a short period of time (about an hour and a half), there was nothing particularly enraging about the way it just stopped happening and the credits rolled in.",6.0,5 August 2022
"A sad, contemplative experience that doesn't hold your hand, and doesn't waste your time.","I went in expecting a good film, as I've heard from others, but I was not expecting to come away from a great film. I can say that I knew very little about this, and I would expect others to go into it with no more information than that of the themes you can expect to see explored. I would say that the surface-level narrative is a bit melodramatic and bizarre, but the tip of the iceberg rests on deeper explorations of grief, and the things we hold onto in the receding wake of loss. It seeks to attach these heavy considerations to a backdrop that is a bit uncanny, but between the director's approach and Cage's emotive performance, I would say that line was walked with aplomb.

The entire experience, from the presentation, to the intimate closeups, as well as the sad serenade at the end, is lovingly crafted and meticulously set before you. Perhaps not everyone will find that the film resonates with them, but I can say that I was moved. In this day and age of paint-by-numbers cash grabs and waning attention spans, to be moved is a bigger and bigger ask. Speaking only for myself, this did the job quite nicely.",9.0,11 December 2021

I'm glad to see that Cage is back to his 'Leaving Las Vegas' Oscar standards after making a few rough choices with other movies.

It is kind of a buddy movie ( no not the pig ), with Mr Cages helper (Amir) being given a heartfelt and eventually, sympathetic portrayal by actor Alex Wolff. Whilst NC is commendable in the role of the Pigless hermit with a complicated backstory, though to be honest, it amounts to mainly grunting, mumbling and looking forlorn yet determined. So, they set out on a quest into the big city in search of his stolen truffle pig, which is where a number of different elements and backstory lines are revealed. Some of them effectively coherent, but some not so.

It turns out to be a search for other things apart from a pig, which is where the main themes are delivered in a not always a satisfying end product, But there is enough to keep the short 92 minutes run time interesting and entertaining enough to rate it a 6 out of 10.",6.0,21 January 2024

one of his bearded roles,"It would be easy just to say that the pig is a better actor than Cage, but that would be a cheap shot, and besides wouldn't fulfil the minimum character requirement. But just because he has a beard and, instead of chewing the scenery as in his younger days, mumbles and hangs his head, that doesn't make it great or subtle acting. It's really just another form of hamminess - no offence to the pig which, as I say, is not a bad actor.

Cage get out of the Kitchen!,"First up Nicolas Cage can not act, full stop. Once you accept that it falls on the director to get the best out of him. Unfortunately Michael Sarnoski was not in a position to dictate to Cage. Cage was the producer. This film so needed someone to tell Cage what to say and how to deliver it. No mumbles with feeling. Not outrage. I could spend 90 minutes reviewing the ridiculous unbelievable boring chapters in this movie. Every scene has mistakes or should have been cut. Unwashed for days bloodied by a door, a frying pan and bashed in a fight but sits unnoticed in a 5 star restaurant. A single band-aid on his face covered in blood and no swelling around the eyes. So fake. My criteria for a good movie is would I watch it again. If pigs could fly for this tripe. Give it a big miss.",2.0,18 July 2021

Good film about loss and grief - just feels a bit drawn out at times,I've been a big fan of nic cages recent films and he has another good performance in Pig. The plot is unique and the acting and shooting is well done. My biggest complaint that keeps this movie from being an 8 or 9 is that it could easily be 20 minutes shorter. A lot of dialogue and scenes are very drawn out and the one scene where rob visits his old house is way too long and boring and completely irrelevant. Overall enjoyable film. 7/10.,6.0,5 January 2022

Pretentious superhero chef movie set in hip Portland,"-It is the film that is the thing that is really pretentious -I mean severely pretentious -oh God this is virulently cloying -it is like a superhero movie for chefs Strange -is a fantasy -a fantasy of a secret violent society underneath Portland(where is he getting this from? Fightclub?) -man needs to get beat up to find someone to find his pig that got stolen(is this so he can go around with a bloody face which becomes his superhero costume} depressing seems pointless cage is some mysterious person with a past He has given up everything to live in the woods the pig is really only the way he makes his living -he eats his truffles alone fried up in a pan -OK it turns out he was famous -IT's all about the truffles -Cage(Mr. Super chef) tells off some high class chef saying his restaurant is crap so he should run a pub(Like he always wanted to do) -a super fancy restaurant seems so much more creative than a pub.

-Why the hell would anyone listen to this idiot who isolates out in the woods(I am a hermit so I respect isolation but) -A goddamn super high class modern food restaurant would be much more of a gamble than an English pub. The people there would care much more about food.(One of the themes is something about ""you were meant to do this"" crap) so he was meant to be a pub owner of all things -why did he steal a pig he could have bought -why would the guy not want the kid to sell buy and sell truffles -""His world"" of what high class restaurants?

-it is really all just a whose got the biggest dick film -some people got talent some people don't -simple stuff is better except for good wine apparently -oh and the simple stuff is a really nice baguette(try making one of those!) -the lines become so stupid it is hard to imagine how the actors could emote.",3.0,14 January 2022
Very good film about allowing yourself grieve and let go of the past.,"Pig is not an action movie or a ""Nick Cage loses it"" movie.

Nicolas Cage is positively outstanding,"Pig (2021)

I think we have reached a point where there should be a separate movie subgenre called Nicolas Cage Films. This man has been taking inexplicably bizarre projects about the most random topics and in the majority of the times, they end up being disastrous. When I heard about Pig, it sounded very unusual but strangely, I felt a mysterious energy drawing me towards this movie and when I saw that awesome poster, I simply couldn't resist. I didn't read the synopsis or any details and all I knew was that the movie is about a man trying to find his kidnapped Pig. Yes, you read that right, a kidnapped Pig.

Rob is a seeming nobody who lives in the forest and spends his days looking for truffles with the help of his Pig. One day, that Pig gets stolen which greatly devastates our protagonist and forces him to go into the city and look for it. Soon enough, we discover that Rob has a mysterious past because the mere mention of his name, sends chills down people's spines. On the surface, this might seem like a John Wick film gone wrong but the neat aesthetics, the unusual narrative and the gravitas of the main character turn into an enjoyable piece of filmmaking and an outstanding character study.

This movie exists and works solely because of Nicolas Cage and a somewhat mythical aura that he exudes with his presence. He is a man on a mission and his every word, glance and movement is focused on the final goal. It is not often that I see bizarre ideas executed so well in terms of both style and substance. It comes down to the first 10 minutes which portray the bond between Rob and his Pig, and if you manage to put aside your scepticism and genuinely feel that moment, you will certainly be able to enjoy this movie. One of my favorites from 2021 so far.

"Profoundly soulful, and likely not what you're expecting.","The best way I can describe this (surprisingly moving film) is like this:

Imagine an episode of Chef's Table (Yes, the Netflix series). However, this episode is basically a remake of John Wick. But instead of an assassin who's a crack shot and seeking revenge for a dog, it's a chef who breaks down people's defenses by cooking sumptuous, life-altering dishes and is looking for a kidnapped pig... Oh, and this episode is directed by Paul Thomas Anderson's equally-talented, slightly less-cynical surrogate brother.

If none of that sounds appetizing to you, then you might be best skipping this film altogether. If that does sound enticing, however, then you are in for an immaculately cooked meal, a film that gives just enough exposition to let you know what's happening, but refuses to cake in all the details with unnecessary plot butter. It will gratify your emotions, edify your mind and leave you full.

Truly moving,"Pig is beautiful in every sense. Its writing is touching, its acting is vulnerable, and its filmmaking is intimate. First, the story is small and concise, allowing for extensive character development and emotional connection. As the plot unfolds, Pig becomes much more about the feelings within its subjects rather than the outward narrative. Nicolas Cage is a force, driving Pig with his tortured soul and frozen exterior. He rarely speaks, but each line drips with torment. Finally, the directional pacing and tone unite vividly, igniting profound reactions in its viewers. Undoubtedly, Pig is one of the most passionate films of the year.

Meanwhile, the technical details of Pig are geared towards sentimental impact. The cinematography uses gentle color palettes, lighting, composition, and movement to create a lonely ambience. The editing is gradual, letting the emotions reverberate. The sound is naturally atmospheric throughout and thunderously silent during peak moments. The production design displays isolation in both ends of society. Lastly, the music is brilliantly integrated into the story, marking the heightened action and the cathartic ending. Overall, Pig is a quiet storm, generating deep responses while remaining very reserved. It is a truly moving experience.

This film is strangely different. Still a unique story, but he plays the role much tighter; a quiet & more insular performance.

Although an odd concept, he plays well against its other lead; young actor, Alex Wolf: excited to see what he can do next.

"Starts out strong, then loses the plot","As ""Pig"" (2021 release; 92 min.) opens, we are introduced to a guy (later revealed as ""Rob"") who lives in a remote cabin, along with his truffle-finding pig. Once a week, one of Rob's friends stop by with supplies and to pick up the truffes, to be sold to restaurants in Portland, OR. Then one night, two guys break into the cabin and viciously attack Rob and steal the pig... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the debut feature length of writer-director Michael Samoski. And what a debut it is! The movie's initial third is very strong indeed, and helped tremendously by the lead performance of Nicolas Cage. To be honest, I can't recall the last movie that I've seen him in. Cage has become a bit of of a joke in recent (and even not so recent) years, with the days of his towering performances like ""Leaving Las Vegas"" long behind him. But here, for whatever reason, Cage is fully ""on"". Alas, the film loses much of its personality when ""the search for the pig"" becomes a long and strange criss-crossing of Portland, OR scenes. Along the way, I also lost track of who really was who. So in the end, the film starts strong, very strong, and then fizzles out and loses the plot. This film has gotten extensive critical acclaim and that is the main reason why I decided to check it out. I can't quite follow the critics here, to be honest.

""Pig"" was filmed over 2 years ago, but of course its original release date in 202 0was shelved due to COVID-19. The film recently opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Monday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (3 people, including myself). If you are a fan of Nicolas Cage or simply are in the mood for an indie film that is miles away from mainstream fare like F9, etc., I'd readily suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",5.0,27 July 2021
Recipe for a near-perfect film,"If you're perhaps lucky enough not to have lost someone you loved, you may not have the life experience yet to understand the complex layers of grief that loss entails. And I don't mean really sad breakups. I mean, death. The most important line of the film comes when a man realizes that coming out of his shell to face the truth, was his only true way to face his agonizing loss, and ultimately recover from it.

That being said, Pig is about loss, and one man's breaking point long after hitting rock bottom.

When a lauded chef's wife dies, he goes into hiding, in denial. Fifteen years later, still barely able to deal with the grief, he has become a shell of a man. But, when his beloved truffle pig is stolen, he strikes out to find her. And in doing so, comes to accept his own wife's death, and on his way to establishing cherished friendships once again.

The film is excellent. The acting excellent. Nic Cage is really hitting a career mark here. There are scenes with very little dialog that cut with raw emotion that is somewhat uncomfortable at times but, very moving to anyone who has ever felt they were here, in these places; a neglected son, a grieving spouse, a cold-hearted father, glimmers of seemingly real, dirty, ugly moments captured on film. And I do not mean over the top hammy acting. The writer here and filmmaker really understood what they were crafting. The fact that this was a quick shoot and not huge in the budget, probably served the effort well in the end. The editing had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.

I've seen reviews that say, beware: this isn't silly action star Nic Cage-- like that is a bad thing! Or that the character, Rob, is annoying. Oh, and a reviewer that mentioned a yellow Maserati? Excuse me, that clearly is a Camaro! Sigh. Not everyone who can leave a review, should leave a review. If you didn't get it, move along. I get that you thought of a cute title for your little dig, but come on. I love Jackson Pollack. For some, they just see spilled paint. That is fine, art is subjective. But when you say a film is pointless, only because you didn't get it, I think we should be able to rate you a 1 or a 2. In a perfect world, maybe.

I can only chalk that up to inexperience, and shallow entertainment seekers. I love popcorn movies, I do. But this is a grown up film with a purpose. If you're complaining about what it lacks, it probably means you're just in the wrong headspace or just not ready for it yet.

2020 was really hard for everyone. We have all lost people we love. Or know someone who has. The arc of Robin Feld is not just a foray into more grief for the sense of grief, but showing us the painful road back to life is essential for us to truly heal. That is not something done easily. Some never do.

Someone looking for a machine-gun wielding Nic Cage need not apply. This might be just over your coiffed little head. Oh, and the digs at pretentiousness, also very cool. I also love that other message of, live your truth. Do what you love. Don't be fake.

Finding a film of this quiet grace today, is probably harder than finding truffles these days. Please give it a shot. If not, and Con Air is more your speed, just keep it to yourself.",10.0,11 January 2022

Fantastic character-based story,"Nicholas Cage is always interesting, regardless of the quality of the material he is working with. He drew me to this film, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.

I had read that this wasn't a ""revenge"" film, which Cage has become associated with, mostly due to his participation in ""Mandy."" And it's true - this is not a movie about revenge, it is a film about love, and about loss.

Paced very well, with good performances throughout, and some very nice cinematography (as well as some very amateurish, ugly hand-held camera work - so it is a little uneven), this is a finely made film. Especially if it is true that it was shot in 20 days!

The premise, the characters, the whole world (a fight club for chefs?) requires a certain suspension of disbelief... but if you allow yourself to be immersed in this world, the performances will not let you down. The characters, their motivations, and their journeys, all hold true.

I really look forward to seeing more from this director, and I am happy to see Cage appreciated for his talent.",9.0,31 July 2021

Fully Utilized Depth of Cage Talent by Highly Skilled Directing,"This movie delivers something that has been sorely lacking in the industry -- honest, authentic, fundamentally skillful DIRECTING. For the first time in decades, Michael Sarnoski has maniferst the talent to effectively utilize, guide, and distill the deep artistic potantial of Nicholas Cage. With Sarnoski's story, screenplay, and directing, Cage shows all of his capacity as a fine elite tool in the hands of master craftsman Sarnoski.

While this movie will be unappealing to the generation of viewers who need constant over-the-top stimulation and hyper sexuality or hyper violence, this retired industry professional is refreshed to see such an immensely well made piece of film in its traditional art form -- from precise framing to effectively sparse soundtrack, to consistent edit rythm -- few directors remain with such a skillset, which is embraced by Cage.

What a script to bring your A-game to....,"Sarnoski, in his directorial debut, managed to tame the Cage. Solid cinematography work and excellent acting hold up the frame in what could otherwise be dismissed as a throwaway plot concocted on a truly Portlandesque acid trip.

Of all the movies to bring his A-game to, Cage reminds us that he's not just a zany overacting crazy man with an Elvis obsession. Here he delivers a captivatingly understated performance that's overboiling with genuine heart. Not playing second fiddle either, Wolff continues to impress, going toe to toe with Cage in delivery and showing off his range.

Moving film,"Pig: Whilst Nick Cage hogs the limelight. He doesn't chew up the scenery as much as he could have gotten way with, he's just pig in the middle, Cage plays Rob, a truffle hunter who used to be a famous Portland chef. He went a little crazy and off grid after his wife died, now he lives in a remote cabin with his prized foraging pig, who is a friend to him as well as a working animal. Rob sells truffles exclusively to Amir ((Alex Wolff) who sells them on to high end restaurants. Rob is attacked one night and his beloved pig is stolen. Along with Amir he travels across Oregon and on into Portland in search of his fine swine. A road movie where they encounter a series of eccentric characters and old friends of Ron, some meeting both criteria. There is even a sequence where Rob engages in an odd twist on Fight Club in order to get information on the pigs whereabouts. Some really good acting by Cage as he portrays a recluse who has been out of society for 10 years and must now readjust in order to achieve his objective.

"Sublime, as emotionally indulgent as fine dining should be","A movie to remember that cleverly sets out at the start with its cards held closely to its chest, then just unravels so gracefully and with such a profusion of deep themes like love, loss, regret, forgiveness, truth and even reflection on the obscure things like the emotional power of culinary experience, to mention only a few of the facets of this deeply moral and dignified film. This is a lot down to the exquisitely tuned performance from Nicholas Cage, who just seems to get better and better nowadays, but also to the handful of supporting cast members. The chalk-and-cheese pairing throughout with Alex Wolff the truffle buyer is for me a central sub-drama, but like lots of this film you won't get a tidy exposition or resolution, there's lots of work for the viewer to do to process events and performances with their own experiences, to recall how life is rarely straightforward, that there are gaps and lingering feelings, animosities, injuries, failures, but that there is peace and redemption in pardon, in acceptance, and everything to learn from nature.

CAGE IS IN FINE PORCINE FORM...!,"Nicholas Cage stars in this small 2021 drama that packs a remarkably potent punch. Eking out his life out in the wilderness, Cage collects hard to get truffles using his trusty swine which he sells (barters?) for things he needs to live by to a smarmy restaurant supplier, played by Hereditary's Alex Wolff. One night he's awoken & knocked out by a pair of thieves who make off w/his porcine pal which sets off Cage & Wolff to track the pig down through various locales (restaurants) & scenarios (an underground club where wait staff beat up their betters) to finally come within spitting distance of the missing animal. Throughout Cage is remarkably restrained as he deliberately endures this trial of Job calmly deescalating all comers w/a tactful reserve most politicians would kill for. People who've written Cage off for taking roles of late to pay off a past tax bill to the government will find his mojo has never left forever keeping audiences off balance to see if they've gotten a film w/a good Cage performance or the opposite.

This is a character study and a film about love, loss, redemption and finding your place in the world based on your own circumstances.

"Fans of Cage's ""sensitive"" movies are in for a treat","If the last five years haven't been enough to convince you of the terminal dumbing down of a large percentage of the American population, a reading of the majority of IMDB's reader reviews of the 2021 film ""Pig."" will leave you in no doubt. To most who commented, this magnificent film was as wasted on them as pearls before swine.

I've seen ""Pig"" and won't spoil it for you if you're considering seeing it yourself. But it might be helpful if I informed Cage's two distinctly different audiences which of them would like it.

If you are from the audience that enjoys a manic Cage bouncing off the furniture, as in films like ""Mandy,"" ""Trespass,"" and ""Bangkok Dangerous,"" you might want to give ""Pig"" a pass. But if ""Joe"" (except the last 10 minutes) or ""Leaving Las Vegas"" were enjoyable or at least fulfilling for you, what you saw in those films you will see even more of in ""Pig."" Which is to say, the spectrum of human feelings as experienced by characters you come to know.

This is a film about loss. Cage's character experiences it most acutely, but the trauma of being deprived of something or someone vitally important in a person's life is felt by each of the main characters. As it goes along, the story makes clear that some things are worse than loss: among them, not being aware you are experiencing it; and worse, being too shallow to be capable of feeling it.

The vacuous sentimentality of most of today's movies, contrived as they are to appeal to audiences whose souls have been numbed by social media and reality TV, is completely absent here. Probably that is the reason the film bombed in theaters and was quickly transferred to streaming media -- Prime and Apple at this writing.

Today's audiences need to be spoon-fed from the standard menu of Hollywood corn about the nowhere lives of cardboard characters, because that is all they know. Here they have Cage reacting in super close-up as succeeding emotions wash over his features in barely detectable waves. Make that completely undetectable to most American audiences. But the ones who get this movie are in for a treat.

I long suspected Cage was capable of a role like this and now I own the movie because I'll be watching it in the years to come. Not just for Cage's performance, but also for the fine work of the supporting cast; for the writing; for the restaurant racket back story (Anthony Bourdain would have loved this film); and for the camera work and the music. What makes all these elements cohere is the direction by first-timer Michael Sarnoski. That this is his directing debut is almost beyond comprehension. We can look forward to some very fine work from this guy.

I hope he will once again direct Nic Cage. Sarnoski and Cage are locked into the same artistic laser beam, and the result of their collaboration is like oxygen to American film lovers who have been drowning in superheroes and Kardashians for what seems like forever.",10.0,9 November 2021
"Nicolas Cage gives one of his best performances and among the decade's best, Pig is a quiet drama about loss and a beautiful film","Pig was one of the films which got critical acclaim and earned Nicolas Cage his second nomination at the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actor, his career launched back and were once again seen as a respectable actor. I only knew of this film because of Nicolas Cage and his mesmerizing performance, which it is, he's utterly perfect in this role. He's also a producer on the film. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a score of four out of four stars, writing: ""The unpredictable Cage delivers some of his best work in years."" Pig wasn't made for the commercial audience, it's an independent film and one with such a strange premise, an art film and 'well made film' at heart. Noel Murray, in his review of the film for the Los Angeles Times, wrote that, ""Though its plot follows the same rough outline of a John Wick-style shoot-em-up, Pig is actually a quiet and often melancholy meditation on loss, anchored by a character who wishes he could shake free of the person he used to be.""

A truffle hunter who lives alone in the Oregon wilderness must return to his past in Portland in search of his beloved foraging pig after she is kidnapped.

Pig is directed by Michael Sarnoski (who directed the upcoming A Quiet Place: Day One), from a screenplay and story by himself and Vanessa Block. It won the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay. The film stars Nicolas Cage in the main role, it also stars Alex Wolff and Adam Arkin. I've written how brilliant Nicolas Cage is in the role and although Cage is almost solely alone to thank for the acting, the director/writer helped a lot. With a movie that could have been extremely strange, Sarnoski intelligently kept this film grounded and you see throughout every scene how much heart went into making this film. ""Pig"" takes time to develop, both the story and characters, Michael Sarnoski does it brilliantly. There are so many incredible moments and brilliantly written dialogue scenes, and it's the characters which make these scenes so interesting, for example the scene at the restaurant with Rob, Amir and Derek. Though its short run time, this 90 minute film has stronger writing and characterization than any commercial 120 minute film. That takes skill and Michael Sarnoski shows just that. His writing fleshes out all its characters, which combined with fantastic performances, makes them feel all the more real. Sarnoski's use of long takes throughout the film also adds to this realism. The camera work is excellent and so is the editing, great direction and cinematography. The film is shot with this slick color, focusing on different color palettes for the different Parts. Cinematographer Patrick Scola is absolutely perfect in his craft. Pig has been cited as among the best films of the 2020s and the 21st century. I agree. It's a film full of heart, full of drama and simply a beautiful film in a certain way. It's the philosophical nature and how the screenplay delves into its themes, like loss. It's magnificent.",10.0,10 April 2024
Why?,,2.0,18 January 2022
"Well, it could have been worse...","I wasn't in any particular hurry to get to watch the 2021 movie ""Pig"", but got around to it in 2022. So why was that? Well, this being a Nicolas Cage movie, that was essentially the reason for why watching ""Pig"" was not a priority for me.

Writers Vanessa Block and Michael Sarnoski managed to put together a storyline and script that is sufficient enough to provide adequate entertainment for a single viewing. I will say that during the 92 minutes that the movie ran for, not a whole lot of excitement transpired on the screen. So the pacing of the narrative can be somewhat of a struggle to sit through.

It should be said though, in all fairness, that Nicolas Cage actually carried the movie quite well with his performance as Rob. It is actually one of the more intense and spot on performances from veteran actor Nicolas Cage, so that works well in favor of the movie. It was nice to see Adam Arkin in the movie, despite of it only being in a smaller supporting role.

""Pig"" is somewhat of an acquired taste, pardon the pun. But I am sure that there is an audience out there for just such a movie from director Michael Sarnoski. I was mildly entertained by the movie, but this is not a movie that I will ever return to for watching it a second time.

My rating of ""Pig"" lands on a mediocre five out of ten stars.",5.0,11 May 2022
Excellent drama with great acting. One of the best movie's of 2021!,"A true masterpiece, which I was not expecting.

After looking at the trailer I thought the movie would be a kind of Taken (2008) but with a pig instead of a daughter. I was expecting another action based movie with Nicolas Cage. I haven't been this glad to be wrong in a long time.

The movie consists of some amazing acting from both Nicolas Cage and Alex Wolff and some amazing visual directing.

Nicolas Cage doesn't have the most lines throughout the movie, but what he says (mostly near the end) is very powerful and heartfelt.

One other aspect worth mentioning in my opinion is the sounds used. There is no unnecessary music playing to ""keep your attention"". Instead you can actually hear Nicolas Cage walking through the woods; you can hear the branches snapping, the wind, the birds and the pig snoring.

This movie reminded me that it doesn't take tens of millions to make a great movie (budget was 3,5 million). In the end it's al about the acting and the overall story!",9.0,2 November 2021
"A beautiful movie on love, loss... And food.","This truly is a beautiful movie and lives up to the glowing reviews most people have posted. Nicholas Cage plays the part perfectly, and teeters on the edge of keeping his cool or resorting to violence in many scenes. He adds an amazing level of tension to everything. And while the movie on face value seems to be about a pig, it's so much more than that. It's about dealing with loss, facing your inner demons, and letting go. Secondarily but always present, is also the strong connection people can have with delicious food. If you're looking for a John Wick remake, you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for a film that's heartfelt and powerful, I'd highly recommend this one.",8.0,2 October 2021

"The ""Anything can happen - even good stuff Cage"" is back.","Really enjoyable movie :) I liked how they played with the expectations people would have about a Cage movie.

Also it shows, that you actually dont need a grand story to make a good movie. Heck, i'd go as far as to say, that most directors would probably make better movies, if they tried this approach.

I actually think this is the..hum...""best"" movie i saw good ol' Nic in since Adaption! Ofc that is just my personal taste and opinion.

If you like movies where explosions and product placement are more important then the so called story - stay away.

If you like calm movies, that just try to tell a story on a very human level about basic feelings and things that can happen in someones life - this one might be for you.

Very Good Story,"Robin Feld (Nicolas Cage) is a Truffle Hunter with his pig in the Oregon woods. One night intruders come to Rob's cabin and beat him and steal the pig. Rob and Amir (Alex Wolff) go to find who stole the pig. Amir is a seller of Truffles for Rob.

There is much more to tell about Robin Feld, and it would be better for you to learn more as the story progresses as you will be most impressed this way. I was.

This is a good story and you cannot take your eyes off Cage as Robin Feld. Then you notice something. You have seen this face or let's say ""image"" before. Can you guess where? Yes, but this will not interfere with or be a part of the story. It's just make-up. See? Now where did you see it before?

Notables: Adam Arkin as Darius, Amir's father; Darius Pierce as Edgar, owner of a Fight Club where Rob lets himself be beaten to get information who has the pig; David Knell as Chef Derrick, who once worked for Robin Feld and he does supply the name of the person who has the pig.

Notes: The pig was never given a name. The music is simply delightful.

This performance by Nicolas Cage is truly Oscar Worthy and he has my vote. All the cast performed in outstanding manner. Sadly, the Nicolas Cage Impersonators won't be satisfied by Cage's performance as he played his role in too normal a manner. Pity. (9/10)

The perfect film for Cage and one of his best performances in decades.,"Pig farmer goes on a somewhat violent but extremely subdued hunt for his stolen pig. And gets his revenge in the most absolute cruel way possible. And no, it's probably not what you think. In fact I can guarantee it's not what you think but IT IS sinister.

I'm beginning to think there's a genius behind Nick Cage's psychotic erratic behavioral acting method. If you haven't noticed lately, Cage seems to take any job given to him, Not what one would expect from what is still considered an A list celebrity. Yet here we are. And that truly is his genius, truly a thespian. Honing his craft for all time he has on this mortal plane and he should be applauded for it and probably honored more than he is for it.

Ya know how Cage has been kinda crazy for the past couple decades and ya know how he wasn't before that. Well this movies pretty much blends his whole acting life into one performance. And blended it masterfully.

It gets an 8.8-9.0 rating, would have got the extra star if it wasn't for one major scene that made absolutely no sense on why it was put in there. Even though it was the coolest scene in the film and could not have done without it (They just should have explained it more,

Diabolically Bad!,,1.0,28 May 2023
"Mostly grounded, but sometimes bouncing off the walls","What a bizarre career Nicholas Cage has had. You never know what the man is going to come out with next. He could do a massive blockbuster, or he could do the most ridiculous film a human mind could possibly think up, and somehow make it even more insane than it was initially intended. 'Pig' is probably somewhere in the middle. It's certainly no blockbuster, but it is also about as grounded as you'll ever see a Cage character.

'Pig' possesses a very unique style. For a while it will trot along in a very conventional manner, and then out of nowhere a character will be introduced and the film will just go to bizarro-land for a little while. Not in a bad way, just in a ""what is happening?"" way. Those scenes actually do well to break the film up though, otherwise the tone could easily be a little monotonous.

I wasn't quite sure exactly what I was expecting going into 'Pig', all I know is that it wasn't what I got. I think I like what I got more though. It's a surprisingly deep and moving film that has more layers than first meet the eye. I enjoyed this film and would recommend people check it out. 8/10.",8.0,25 July 2021

OK it isn't for everybody. But it is excellent cinema for those with and attention span greater than a goldfish.,"This was a beautifully filmed movie and although the story was clearly too deep for some (Those who gave it really low ratings) for others it was deep enough to encompass a world of emotion and meaning and was shot in naturalistic colours bringing the story it told down to earth.

The acting was absolutely a masterclass in character based acting utilising subtlelty and minimalism to convey powerful story telling instead of screeching smoking tire car chases and typical cliche revenge elements with bullets flying all over the place.

If you want a non stop action movie with zero real storyline or plot but lots of gunfights, explosions, stunts, pretty colours, car chase scenes, choreographed impossible fights and more explosions go and watch one of the John Wick films or one of the Fart and Furriest, but if you do consider a film requires a storyline is more realistic and offers you the chance to exercise your brain then ""Pig"" is definitely worth a watch.

Cage , plays a truffle hunter who lives alone in the Oregonian wilderness but must return to his past in Portland in search of his beloved foraging pig after she is kidnapped.

Who would have though that a love affair between a man and his pig would be so moving? Rob loves his pig so much, he will move heaven and earth to get her back including taking part in a strange fighting tournament and making the perfect meal for the man who took the love of his life . The man is desperate and Cage portrays that desperation perfectly.

Over acclaimed movie with soporific story.,"I have seen a lot of positive opinions about ""Pig"" and in fact it won several prizes. I liked that this was not the usual revenge movie, even though at the beginning I really thought that this was the way the director wanted to go. However I could not feel involved in the story or in the characters, because everything is so slow: we do not really get to know who is the protagonist and his partner, until much later, when honestly I already lost my interest for the plot. For me a screenplay is well developed when writers reveal small chunks, without giving away everything, keeping the attention of the audience. Instead, Michael Sarnoski keeps raising questions about the characters' past, then he starts giving some answers 40 minutes in. On a movie that lasts just one hour and a half, I would say that it is pretty late. There are a few dialogues that do not fit in at all. Seems like someone forgot to cut some sequences during the final editing.

Nicolas Cage is neither better or worse than he usually is and I don't understand how he could win an award as best actor. Alex Wolff, who I loved in ""Hereditary"", here he was very flat and could not convince me as the misunderstood son of a rich businessman. I have to admit that the photography was very neat, I really liked the lighting, some shots in their simplicity are very effective and overall the general technical level is competent.

The fear of losing a loved one,"Nicolas Cage and a pig looking for truffles in the woods - if you look at this initial situation, you immediately expect the next sleaze film from the formerly celebrated Hollywood star. But instead of being immediately taken by surprise by an impulsive Cage, you get to see the unkempt Rob, who lives a secluded life and shares a special relationship with his pig. When the pig is stolen one day, Rob involuntarily confronts his past and returns to his origins.

Even in his early roles, which earned Cage an Oscar win for Leaving Las Vegas, among others, he played anything but reserved. It's just that, unlike performances of past years, he had his quiet, subdued moments in which he conveyed a wide range of emotions to us like no other. In Pig, Cage returns to that very strength. He is the clear star of the film and doesn't go about any of his scenes in a rushed manner. In fact, he only has two moments in which he erupts emotionally, and he masters them with irresistible control. It's simply wonderful to see that Cage still has such an impressive command of his game despite all his recent failures. With Alex Wolff he is given an equal partner, who as Amir stands in the shadow of the protagonist Rob, but for his part has his own inner conflicts going on. In general, the two share a very authentic and effective chemistry that, despite few exchanges of words, takes over in every sequence. But back to our thought lost Star Cage. Even with the premise of him trying to reclaim his beloved pig, I instantly had an indie version of John Wick in mind. However, Pig could not be more different. Instead, the film is an empathetic character study, handled and accompanied with such sensitivity in a handful of dialogues, that it intrigued me more than films crammed with twists and turns. Cage especially excels when he says it all through eye contact. In the insanely intense restaurant scene, it takes him several minutes to finally open his mouth. It feels like it takes hours for Cage's eyes to meet those of an old acquaintance - but that's exactly what hooked me. Wolff is a perfect complement to this mimic feast. Cage manages to breathe life and passion into a man who at first seems dead inside in an extremely wacky way. Rob, after all, is not broken at all, but has a great fear of loss and disloyalty.

Michael Sarnoski's directorial debut is phenomenal in that he takes what should be an absurd premise and turns it into something fascinating that I had never seen before. Pig is hard to digest for 1 ½ hours and left me speechless. On the one hand, there are the beautiful images that powerfully capture the contrast between nature and industry. On the other, the score, which builds up a lot of tension only to take a 180° turn at the end and hit the tear-jerker without any clichés. But it is especially the journey that Cage takes us on. An atmospheric rollercoaster ride that makes him more human, but probably hurts him more than we as viewers can imagine. Sometimes I would have liked a little more consistency and logic in certain moments. But perhaps it is precisely the complete lack of exposition that makes Pig such a terrific surprise.",9.0,2 January 2022

"Slow, boring, pretentious, needs more pig.","Ever see one of those movies that's so far up it's own... The pig was cute. Portland is pretty. There were people walking around and sometimes they spoke to each other. Investing some of that $500 budget into a freakin' tripod would have been a vast improvement. So would cutting it down to about 20 minutes, because the story goes absolutely NOWHERE. There are random scenes that do nothing to advance the plot, and with the exception of a couple diatribes, characters pause for an average of 5 SECONDS between lines. Then there's the inevitable lingering shot when each scene is over that lasts at least 30. Hey, want to see some more shots of forestry that are almost as good as the screen saver for an AppleTV?

Dude, just admit it's a short film!

This movie would have been fun to watch NOT in a theater, because the absence of plot, character development, slow timing, the fact that they exist in a world without soap, nose bandages AND ONLY nose bandages, etc. Leaves a lot of low-hanging fruit for comedy. In terms of bad movie ratings using ""The Flop-House"" podcast's scale (it's going to be a beautiful Cagemas this year), I would rate this movie somewhere between Good-Bad, and Bad-Bad.",2.0,25 July 2021

This wonderful film celebrates melancholy in a way that few can, such as St. Vincent, Maggie or Gran Torino. So much is told without much talking, and that is what a visual medium must do.

Nick Cage, for once, doesn't have to convulsively try to stage anything, to contort himself. He just tells a story. He's just there. And he's very, very good.

How it captures the underground nature of such an insular community that if you've never been a member of you'll never understand. Albeit in an over dramatized manner, it still has come closer to showing what being a chef is really about more than any gritty drug movie or celebratory journey of self discovery through food crap.

"A touching, bittersweet experience","PIG is certainly not the schlocky, revenge-driven B-movie one would assume based off of the initial trailers. This is a very disciplined drama film, through and through. It's a truly bittersweet experience, beautiful in its raw melancholy. This movie released while I was visiting Portland and immediately began seeing the glowing reviews and commentary about how it's ""the most Portland movie ever"" - so naturally, I made it a point to see it IN Portland on my last night in town - it lived up to the hype!

The sparkling music score by Alexsis Grapsas and Philip Klien play a huge part in elevating this film to a further emotional tier - and much to my joyful surprise, the music works just as well as a standalone album - it's some of the most pleasant music I've heard released this year. Cage plays the role perfectly, never with too much flash - just enough to make his estranged character Robin Feld a very believable, very human being. Alex Wolff (of Hereditary notoriety - he stole the show in that movie) at first feels like the weak point of the film, but it's more in the writing and the complete lack of subtlety with his character, however, by the time you get halfway through the film, that whole notion is pretty much flipped on it self and his character ends up feeling like exactly what it needs to be.

I won't even say too much more other than reiterating the point that what feels like a film that would naturally turn into some sort of revenge movie becomes anything but - it's an extremely focused and effective character study of three troubled characters, and they all learn painful lessons through each other's struggles or faults. It's a sincerely emotional ride and a near flawless if not completely flawless film - the only reason why it's not my favorite movie of the year thus far is because I don't see it as having so much replay value, whereas my fave Zola is a movie I could watch over and over and over again. Regardless, everyone should give PIG a chance.",9.0,23 July 2021

I thought this is a bit above my level of understanding the food loving crowd. So I read the comments here and googled Portland for its food scene and ... nothing changed.

I mean being a chef is the same as being any professional it requires patience experience creativity and talent to become one. And that is why I don't not really appreciate the plot.

The story is as if every chef is a day-to-day life saver, super important person and if one is gone missing the whole city will remember him/her for decades That's just not true. Nobody IRL gives a penny about them.

Masterful Performance from Nicolas Cage in a Masterpiece Film,"8 of 10 stars. Nicolas Cage puts on a Masterful performance in this Film. When I see Nicolas Cage putting on a performance like this, it brings to the forefront of my mind that when he is really on his 'A' game (which he often is), there just aren't many Actor's that are capable of achieving the levels of depth that he achieves. If you are a fan of Acting Performances, this Film is worth watching just for that.

However, this Film is a Masterpiece not only because of Nicolas Cage. It is also Directed with a clear and focused vision by Michael Samoski, who also wrote the Story. He does an extremely good job Directing this Film. This is the 1st Feature Film that Samoski has ever Directed, and it's impossible for me not to get excited about what he's going to do for his 2nd Film.

The rest of the cast put on good performances that are unquestionably believable, good job.

If you'll allow me to point out a complaint about a Film that I do call a Masterpiece, it would be this: Cage would have had more looks from strangers in restaurants or not let into restaurants (or other places) with all the blood he had all over his face, and the attire he was wearing; and he had plenty of chances to clean up in the Film. It's just a little thing, and not to argue with myself, but it does help to create its own reality in the Film.",8.0,29 November 2021
A pacifist version of John Wick and I loved it!,"This is such a lovely film.

A beautiful tale on what is real in this world, what truly matters and your belief in your own abilities.

In the title, I say it's a pacifist version of John Wick and I stick by that.

Whereas Keanu looks for his dog and kills a shed load of people to get it back to then reach inner peace, Nic does the same but instead of a dog there is a pig and instead of confrontation, there is conversion.

This is NOT an action film.

It unfolds it's tale and gives you something to ponder on.

I understand movies are for make believe, the extraordinary, the spectacular.....this does that but in subtler ways.

It's not slow, per se, the story doesn't waste time. Every scene is there to enlighten. It doesn't move at a 100 mph. It cruises at a gentle 50 on a coastal road with the breeze in your hair.

This film is more of a lesson in life. If you're not looking for that in an evening's entertainment, watch something else (that's not a criticism of your taste but more of an acceptance of the mood you should be in to watch this).

If you do want to see a film where one man makes things rather than breaks things, PIG is for you.",8.0,27 January 2022
Is there a storyline in this movie?,,3.0,20 July 2021
Revenge is not always the answer...,"When I watched this movie, I had no idea what I was getting into. While I was scrolling through IMDb, I saw the title for this film and it says ""A truffle hunter... searches for his foraging pig after she is kidnapped."" and immediately I thought ""Ok, we are getting another John Wick movie but this time with a pig"". I was sold.

I was wrong. This movie was nothing like John Wick, not even close. If you are expecting a violent revenge movie, you are most likely to be immensely disappointed. However, this movie did surprise me in many ways, and I am glad I saw it. It was a beautiful yet very painful movie to watch at the same time.

Our main character played by Nicholas Cage does an amazing job. At first, I was hesitant about watching another Nicholas Cage movie since over the past few years I have watched a few Nic Cage movies and he always plays these over-the-top characters, but oh boy not in this movie. His character in this movie is very unpredictable and unstable like a ticking bomb. You have no idea what he is going to do next. He is very calm in every scene but deep down you know there is more to his past. Throughout the first half of the movie, his identity is almost kept secret. You have no idea who or what his character motives are other than to find his pig, making it an unnerving ride of a film. The supporting actor played by Alex Wolff also does a great job.

The ending for Pig packs such an emotional ruthless punch that will probably stay with me for a while after I finished the film. My only problem with the film was the first half where the pacing was kind of uneven, but when the last half of the movie kicks in and you discover more about Cage's character, that's when the whole movie started propelling forward and I was absorbed into every second of the movie.

I am going to say this again, this is not a revenge movie or action movie, it's more of a movie about grief and how one suffers from it and how you choose to live with it. This movie is packed with emotions from beginning to end and once you get into Cage's character's shoes you will be absorbed into his world and you will feel for him and the decisions he makes and I loved every second of it.

Kudos to Michael Sarnoski for making his first amazing debut. I will be sure to keep an eye out for future films from him.

I give this movie a 9/10.",9.0,23 December 2021

Classic Film perfectly executed. Cage is Back!,"This film was a complete wonderful shock of a surprise especially to see a great actor like Cage finally get a script and director that shows his unique talent again. It has been a long time yet this film starts off a little slow and strange but stick with it as the entire story comes together perfectly executed like a classical piece from Bach or Mozart from start to finish. It is not a thriller or an action film but a classic like Being There.

Luckily I did not know anything about the film and advise to go into it with little reference as it is unique and strange in its own manner. Yet i would compare it to Manchester by the Sea, Adaptation, or Being There. It is beautiful done and is well written story that slowly develops about a down and out torn hero/chef from Portland and how losing his pig brings him closer to his past and along the way develops a wonderful journey with his side kick young Amir and many colorful characters.

The cinematography is extremely well done almost looking like a John Wick film even in the look of Cage but that is about the only reference to that movie as it is less about violence and more about deeper issues of love, inner journey, restaurant life and eccentric chefs that remember every meal they made for each customer - and every detail to perfection. And the troubled past that makes the central character lose his path except for the love of a pig he ventures on a wonderful journey through Portland to find himself Again.

The acting is superb and the minimalism works to perfection along with a unique score that makes this director bring together a classic film. A rarity these days yet it might not be everyone's truffle as fine gourmet cuisine is an art form.

Best movie of 2021,"Michael Sarnosky made his first debut in this movie. By the look of the trailer of the movie, people thought that this movie is similar to John Wick. But this movie is far more superior to most of the films that came out recently.

This slow pace drama takes place in the Oregonian wilderness, a single living person, Rob, who used to be a chef in Portland, now hunts truffles with his pet pig and sells them to an inexperienced seller Amir. One night some local unidentified assailants kidnap his pig for an unknown reason and this is where the movie began. His search for his pig brought some past hidden life/truth of his in the movie.

I think this movie is for people who wronged Nicholas Cage and his performances throughout his career. We saw in search of his pig he was forced to cope with his anger and unstable reality which he left after his wife died. For him, this is a reality where he got hurt, betrayed. His loneliness and unsocial activities vanished when he entered society. There is also a glimpse of black comedy when he meets Derrik who was a chef in his former restaurant. The character arc between Rob, Amir, and Amir's father is beautifully crafted and very realistic for the audience. Also, the cinematography is well suited for this script.

This indie drama film is about finding solace in who lost someone they love even though their memory can be painful and suffering.

This is the best film of 2021 for me.",9.0,7 January 2022

The anti-john Wick movie - a meditation on loss,"It is not an action flick-- so anybody who is not ready to welcome a slow moving experience should skip this one.

I went in blind when watching this film and it was pretty touching although it admittedly dragged a bit in a few places. But the rythm and pace is very deliberate. As is the casting of Nicolas Cage, especially coming from the heels of movies like 'Mandy'.

This is a movie which takes it's time, it allows the viewer to contemplate, similar to the two protagonists having to reflect on their own life and the root of their unhappiness. Seriously they don't make movies like this anymore, where they slow things down and deaccelerate the story. It's an intriguing story, especially in today's time where lots of people don't want to confront their own troubles and instead distract themselves and go back to the comfortable cage of misery.

"A very good movie, totally different from what you might expect...","Let's be honest... a lot of the recent movies of Nic Cage were... average at best. This one is not at all.

When I first read the short description of it (I am still buying Blu-rays and read what is written on them instead of watch 15 episodes of some Marvel series in a row on a newer form of pay tv I do not know nothing about because an algorithm is saying: Watch this, I want to make money) I thought this is more or less a story like John Wick or some other close to rampage movie.

Somebody takes his pig hostage which he loves and he goes on a rampage to get it back - and if well done that can be fine and a movie worth watching so it might not be a great one.

But no. This movie playes with your expectations in such a way that you are really mislead and astonished some times - in a very good way.

It's a Miracle I Even Watched It,"I grew to not like Nic Cage. His face. His oh so crazy characters. Also his face, which made me angry for some reason.

And yet I watched it based on one throwaway comment I read on Reddit. The movie was incredible. Nic Cage was Leaving Las Vegas good. He's believable, and most importantly, his character demands empathy. No small task considering my distaste for his face.

The movie's message rumbles and fades and purrs and wanes. The pacing keeps you waiting yet enough clues abound to keep you engaged. This is such a great movie. A slow burn to be sure. Don't except Nic Cage the action star.

"Refreshing and Deep, A Great Drama for the True Intellectual","The negative reviews I see here are very clearly from people that don't understand or appreciate the real purpose of the film, and many of them say so outright. This isn't to sound superior, but to say this film really isn't for everyone. But everyone this film is for is going to walk away satisfied and with something to ponder.

It's a quiet, nuanced film for those who are tired of the usual over-the-top, crowd pleasing films we see so often today.

The film takes a much deeper cut into the reality of human emotion, and certain psychological concepts. It's can feel fast paced but this I feel is to the film's benefit as it doesn't waste time at any point on unnecessary drama and needless dialogue. There's no hand-holding telling you how you're supposed to feel or what you're supposed to be thinking because this isn't something you just sit down and watch, this is something that is meant to be experienced.

A search of lone man for the things he care about.,"First thing first - It is not a John Wick with pig.

I mean it could have gone that way and turned out to be a train wreck easily but instead it took a different route and became masterfully crafted ""anti-revenge"" story about a lone and battered and the things that he cares about.

On certain points the film felt as if could turn into cheesy meodramatic fest but Michael Sarnoski tightly hold ther narration, plot and pace together and amalgamated it to make a fine whiskey which will get better as it gets old.

Nicolas Cage gave one of the best performance after Mandy, the man is on a roll. Now, Nic Cage is usually associated with over the top, unhinged and extravagant characters but in this flick he was incredibly restrained (obviously there is Cage rage scene in a movie). He is in peace while living in forest with his pig, desperate when his pig gets kidnapped and tender when he visits his past to find the pig. Alex Wolff and Adam Arkin were also good, considering Arkin only had 10 minutes of screen time at most.

Another thing that I liked about the movie is music. It mixes extremely well the scenes and scenary and gives a certain sense of mystic to the entire film atmosphere.

All in all, it is one of the best movies of 2021 and definitely worth the watch. I wouldn't be surprised if Nic Cage gets Academy award for his performance.",8.0,25 July 2021

I can summarize the entire plot in three sentences. If you told me those three sentences, I would have laughed and asked why they would make that into a movie.

Nothing about this movie is specifically bad, I just feel like it brought nothing of value to the table and doesn't justify the time it takes to watch it. Even worse, any kind of satifying conclusion or resolution is nonexistent. (1 viewing, 5/13/2022)",2.0,14 May 2022

Made into a Good Film Only Because Cage Did It!,"Cage may be a bit of a disaster in his real life and personal life, but like most genius's they are quite different then the rest of us. Eccentric? Yes. Unorthodox? Yes. Destined to receive a lifetime award for some of the best acting performances ever to grace the silver screen? Undoubtedly!

Cage is definitely eccentric but oh boy can he ever act when he gets a script written superbly!

Cage can be hit or miss sometimes on his recent films, but when a well written script is presented to him, he most effectively can bring that film to another level with his acting chops! Mandy, Color Out of Space, Pig...his more recent jobs have all been made much better only because he chose to accept the roles in these films! Mandy most likely would have been a misunderstood disaster with anyone else in that leading role. With Nick that film transformed from a film that would have been a 4/10 with anyone else in the role was elevated to a 6.5/10.

Color out of Space, a Lovecraftian horror flick would most likely have been a disaster around 4/10, and once again risen to a much better number only because Cage's portrayal not only made the show more interesting and a little crazy, but the viewer would think about the film and Cage in it for days after watching the film! It's no masterpiece, but Cage made it better.

Pig, this movie falls right into the exact same position as those other films where this flick would have been written off as a total loss and simply not a good film with any other lead actor. Cage brings his charisma, his heavy step and his incredible aura into this role. You can feel this man's pain in the movie because one look at his exterior combined with the heavy heart you can see in his eyes and his next level acting chops once again leave the viewer thinking about this film and Cages portrayal for days after having finished this film! This film is a drama and a tragedy with heavy themes, complex personalities and is just a solid drama film. 8/10 on this one! If you don't watch drama films then you should avoid this one.

"An Unexpected, Intense Thriller","""We don't really get a lot of things to care about.""

A truffle hunter who lives alone in the Oregonian wilderness must return to his past in Portland in search of his beloved foraging pig after she is kidnapped. Pig is an unexpected, intense thriller. With a plot this unique, it's hard to imagine how seriously it's taken. But with great direction, a compelling script, and an introspective central performance by none other than Nicolas Cage, Pig stands out this year. If we're going to talk about anything, it's going to be Nicolas Cage. Not only does he rank with some of the best performances of the year, but I believe it to be his best performance of his career. His acting is subtle to the point where he heard my even talks. If I'm correct, he doesn't even talk for a good 30-minutes. Most of the dialogue is given to Alex Wolff. And I will say Alex Wolff is really making a name out of himself within the past few years. One scene in particular is very emotional and Cage portrayed it with perfection. Throughout, we meet a few different characters in hopes that they either know some information or have his pig, and all are good performances even if they're short lived. The acting might just be the best aspect of the movie.

Writer and director Michael Sarnoski does very well. Each scene captures the right amount of emotion to take the movie seriously. Not once did I ever think it was too absurd. One thing that I really liked was the moments with the pig. They're so heartfelt and it gets down to the core of the character and what this movie is about. As the story continues, it grows into something more gritty. The dimly lit cinematography fits incredibly well with it. I also like how somethings are kept with the characters. For example, Nicolas Cage has blood on him over the course of the few days they're looking for his pig, and nobody questions why he hasn't cleaned up. This might just be a me thing, but I liked how something as simple as blood is kept to remind us what's at stake. Anyway, I think the movie could've worked more on its pacing. It's fairly short and is a slow burn, but sometimes it dragged on a little too much and I felt like I wasn't as engaged as I could've been. That might take a second watch or so to get some getting used to. All in all, Pig is a solid thriller and I'm eager to revisit it in the future. Unfortunately, it's not in most theaters but it is available to rent on VOD so I'd suggest having a watch if you so desire.",8.0,12 August 2021

I was relatively interested in this movie after watching the trailer but after watching Redlettermedia's review I was really excited to see this. Instead, I'm going to summarize all the 1 star reviews. This film is boring, incredibly boring, utterly boring, pretentious, unrewarding, nonsensical, dreary, pointless, dreadful, annoying, artsy, deceptive, odd, tedious, slowest, snobby, pseudo-philosophical, disappointing, pointless, overrated and bewilderment for how anyone could give this movie a high rating. Yeah, I hated this film as well. It reminded me of 'My Dinner with Andre"". Just simply unwatchable. I found Alex Wolff's character so over the top and purely insufferable. Definitely a movie for the emotion ""Notebook"" crowd. I'm sure you and your wife will love this. ( Throws EMOTIONAL intelligence hat in the garbage) Definitely not for people like me. Sorry but if you enjoyed this movie we probably aren't going to be close friends. Song time.

Weird and sad,"John Wick in the Multiverse of Madness

Going into this movie, I was aware of people comparing it to the first John Wick movie. In many ways that was true. Nicholas Cage as a reclusive man lost his beloved pig, so now he wanted to have his pig back. Although Cage's character looked very old and sad, there's also the look of a hardened and experienced man.

The profession of Cage's character was quite shocking at first. When I learned about his past and also the people he had to deal with, I was in denial because of how bizarre it sounded. I thought maybe the words the characters used were analogies that had cryptic messages about something darker like drugs.

There was a great scene at a restaurant where Cage's character talked to a chef. It showed how badass and respected Cage's character was. This scene was equivalent to the boss's son learning about John Wick's past.

The progression of the movie was very similar to John Wick. This, along with the profession, made me feel like Pig was some kind of parody of John Wick. Instead of a man attacking with guns, this man attacked with foods. It sounds weird (it is). I was laughing at some scenes because of Nicholas Cage's great acting, and the bizarre concepts.

However, in many ways this movie was different from John Wick. Don't expect any fun bloody action. Instead, be prepared for a slow and meditative drama about a man dealing with his past and preserving his old memory. What Cage's character did at the end reminded me of Remy in Ratatouille. With the ending, the more I thought about Cage's character, the more I felt sad and heartbroken for the character. It's pretty depressing.

As for problems, the first 20 minutes were very confusing because I didn't know about truffles. There was also another scene after that made me felt even more confused. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be funny or serious.

Overall, a weird but sad and great movie if you stick through until the end. 8.5/10.",8.0,23 July 2021

John Wick but with vagrant Nicholas Cage? Wrong,"Once in a blue moon, we are reminded that despite all the low-quality all style, no substance trash Nicholas Cage stars in, he is still one of the best award-winning actors out there. And he's here to prove it.

Pig is a beautiful film chock full with excellent performances, masterful cinematography and soul. Its message is clear and concise, but still leaves enough space for the audience to fill make their own conclusion.

Is it perfect? Probably not. Should you watch it? Absolutely.",10.0,31 July 2021
"Not perfect, but so well done... recommend++","First of all, Nic Cage is NOT my favorite actor...But he does an amazing job here. Like, award level job. How was this not nominated? How did this not win?

Anyway, the movie is NOT about a pig. The movie is about being human in society, which encompasses every person in every career, at every age. It addresses the importance of real vs fake, it address loss, and it does a fantastic job of revealing the real person vs the façade of career.

Not a spoiler: but at one point (actually twice), the protagonist faces a man who begins the conversation with listing his business importance. Then the protagonist proceeds to speak to the real and emotional, and circumvent what the person believes to be the most important. It breaks them.

I was not expecting John Wick, I had already heard about the movie, which is why I was willing to see to it. Good reviews. They did not disappoint.

Recommendation: do NOT go into this movie with genre expectations, but see it!

HOWEVER, do not expect this movie to give you neatly wrapped-in-a-bow answers to ponder over. This movie forces you to ask questions of your own life, but does NOT provide answers.",8.0,9 May 2022

Brilliant,"I wasn't sure what I was expecting from this film, but what I got was vastly different to any expectations I did have.

Firstly there is the performance by Nick Cage which is fantastic. It's a very restrained, reigned in performance for the most part, with little dialogue and a lot of expression, and it's superb to watch.

Secondly this film just looks gorgeous. The cinematography is pretty close to flawless and the direction from Sarnoski is just as good. It has a very arty feel, but not in an overly pretentious way which is a good balance to strike.

Then there is the plot, which may be where the biggest surprise comes. Despite the subject matter I think this film actually has quite a meditative and calming quality come the end. It is an exploration of emotion and grief and loss, and feels quite cathartic in a way.

Pig is not what I was expecting but it was a most welcome surprise.",8.0,5 September 2021

Cage is absolutely brilliant (hand up I'm an unabashed Cage fan). Yes, he has been in some utter nonsense recently, but do not think for one second that his performance in this film falls into those categories.

Partially successful.,"Just the previous review I wrote about the performances of these already older actors, stating that they are usually quite weak. This is a movie where skill is needed no more from the pig than from the lead actor. But the script and direction are exactly what the film world needs, diversity. The story itself is not world-changing, but the diversity fascinated me. The points I gave are already good for me, very few even reach this level. As for the performer of the main role, it really doesn't matter who is behind the bruised and hairy face, there is no need for big gestures, a stranger would probably have coped well with that.",5.0,27 September 2022
A rare film.,"""Pig"" can be misleading in its premise at first glance, yet Nicolas Cage manages to deliver a poetic film of a kind that has been rare and lacking in recent years. The characters of ""Pig"" are rich in depth and emotion, no doubt brilliantly evoked by Cage's riveting performance, and it would be impossible to have not formed a connection with them by the end of it. Dealing with themes of family, loss, coping, companionship, mentorship, and commerce, ""Pig"" is a timely treatise on appreciating the little things and lovingly devoting oneself to them with all one's heart. The film's namesake represents more than just the main character's commercial partner, but a lifelong partner and companion to a character whose life was shaken by one of the worst, if not the worst, kinds of loss.",8.0,14 August 2021
Glacially paced and without payoff,"I appreciate many simple, slow-burn films, such as The Lighthouse, I'm Thinking of Endings Things, and In the Bedroom, so I am not allergic to the style.

This one may simply come down to taste. In reading the A. V. Club's glowing review, the aspects that delighted the critic did nothing for me.

The script offers little and is dulled by a painfully slow pace. Examples of things that didn't do it for me:

-Multiple minutes were used to show someone arriving somewhere -A Cage monologue talking about periodic earthquakes that doesn't seem to make any sense nor have clear relevance to its context -Odd editing choices: >Characters are cut off repeatedly during non-filler dialogue >An intimate scene between two characters seeing each other for the first time in who knows how long, that never cuts to even a single close-up of either character, staying in a wide shot that shows no facial expressions for the duration of the scene. There is not even interesting body language that the director chose to focus on or anything that could be offered as a motivation for this -We are given little reason to care even slightly for any of the characters, so when things happen to them, there is no emotional payoff

Cage: Pig in the City,"I was intrigued by Pig's compelling premise and the atmospheric trailers; and Pig, at first glance, appears to borrow from the original plot of John Wick (just swap dog for hog). That's where the similarities end however, because this is a slowly delicate story of grief, of loneliness and resurgence in the world.

Nicolas Cage, in perhaps the most un-Nicolas Cage film of his - shall we say varied - career, gives a sensitive and emotionally quiet performance as Robin Feld, a once revered chef who now lives a semi-nomadic lifestyle with his beloved foraging pig in the Oregon wilderness.

Cage is excellent and is backed up in almost equal measure by Jumanji's Alex Wolff. However, despite its themes and the display of acting talent involved, I came away from this feeling hollow. Sarnoski had a lot to say but ultimately says nothing at all with ideas that are half-cooked and never fully realised, all in a drama that's way too short at nearly 80 mins.

Excellent Economical Adult Drama,"Having read many reviews here on IMDB before renting ""Pig,"" I expected ""Old Joy"" meets Kwai Chang Cain in a gourmet restaurant after a Fight Club. Actually, that's pretty much the story elements. But story elements mean nothing without a story, and holy pig, is there one great, adult, mature, in 2021 rare, story here. Nicolas Cage deserves any and every award he's headed for, if for no reason other than his abiility to take a preposterous premise and make the audience totally forget how preposterous it is. Love is preposterous, and in the end, this film is about how love, lost, rips the mind, shreds the heart, destroys hope, and humiliates the mere idea of meaning.

I knew I was watching one for the ages in a scene halfway through (the film's short running time is around ninety minutes). Robin Felt - note the symbolic name, the verb in the past tense, Robin ""FELD"" (he felt, but feels no more) - confronts in one of those intolerable by-invitation-only grub joints a guy who once worked for him. While credit for this scene belongs to David Knell as the chef of the hoity-toity eatery. Robin's devastating but compassionate destruction of the man's Portland pretentiousness leaves the guy in tears. He challenges a man now a poseur to recall what he once dreamed of before he sold out, and at the end, the chef is a tearful penitent out of a Jesus saga. In fact, at several points in the film, I asked myself if Cage's ""Jesus in Oregon"" appearance was intentional. Robin FELD never bathes, he never changes his rags--he *is* a Jesus figure, particularly in regard to how he forces the film's villain to answer the central, pressing question: ""Where is my Pig?""

Robin uses love aggressively with everyone, or rather, with everyone capable of examining his or her life. So... ""Old Joy"" is here, and so is Kelly Reichert, and the aggressive love I as an east coast viewer have come to associate with indie Oregon film. Unlike Reichert, with Michael Sarnoski, ""Pig's"" director (and writer), the sense of love is much greater than any aggression. Bravo, bravo, bravo to everyone involved.",10.0,6 November 2021

Astoundingly good!,"Michael Sarnoski's pic about a cantankerous hermit and truffle hunter (called Robin) and his adored truffle pig is one of the year's best, with Nicholas Cage and Alex Wolff (as Robin's go between) giving both understated and powerful central performances. The movie is quiet and dialogue is minimalist, and whatever is said therefore counts. We've been so used to crazy Nic Cage's antics over the past decade, one forgets that he is still an academy award winning actor. And so he proves in a magnetic performance, full of still pauses and slow burn deliberation. It's the story of a man who has left a stellar haute-cuisine career behind (perhaps due to the death of a loved one), to focus on what's important. Perhaps one can say the same for Nicholas Cage himself. Pic itself doesn't strive for effects and lets the story play out gently but inexorably to a devastating conclusion. A strong streak of indie style filmmaking is evident throughout, especially in a tender, wordless and pastoral coda. This is one of my favourite movies of the year. Don't miss it!",8.0,26 July 2021

And his only companion is his pet pig who appear to have a gift of finding him truffles. And whatever money he makes, it would be more for his pet pig than it would be for him. And of course, he has only one buyer, a young guy who loves to drive nice cars, and his name is Amir (Alex Wolf). As viewers see Rob accepting whatever little money Amir has given him was quite obvious that he is not paying him enough. Then one night a group of guys break into his little shack and stole his pet pig. And by the time he wakes up from unconscious he goes on an odyssey to retrieve him. He does this by going to some of the restaurants he knows about where his truffles may have been sold to. And he does this with the help of Amir since he does have a car, which anyone who are not able to figure out by now, Amir may have something to do with his pet pig being stolen.

Cage is amazing,"Was both sort of what I expected but also not at all what I really expected, so it was a nice surprise to see this go in the various directions it did.

This is certainly some of Nicolas Cage's best work as an actor, and also one of his most subdued and emotional performances. I thought he was fantastic for every second he was on the screen, and he for sure deserves some award recognition.

The rest of the movie's no slouch, either. It's methodically paced without feeling dull, owing to its tight screenplay and purposeful editing, and the look of the film is also fantastic, looking equally great whether it's showing outdoor forests or cramped, dimly lit interiors.

It's a great character study, and I feel like the premise is mainly just there to serve as a way of exploring Cage's character, as well as the other people he comes into contact with. Also: that final scene is perfect, and concludes the film on a great note.

I know I'm late to this, so it's probably not something I can ""recommend"" if everyone else has already seen it, but for anyone else who's sleeping on it, I'd highly recommend it as one of 2021's best so far.",8.0,17 October 2021

Or those familiar with Nick Cage's more recent work who associate him with his more commercial efforts like American Treasure and are looking for something in that vein.

Cuz this great film won't be at all to your taste.

Bringing home the bacon,"Reclusive truffle hunter Robin finds his world turned upside down when his beloved pig is kidnapped in the middle of the night. With the help of Amir (whom acts as Robin's only real contact with the outside) Robin sets off in search of his pig...

Given the Sky Movies write up for this film I was expecting a very different film (I thought it might follow similar lines to John Wick; in that film Wick's dog is taken from him). What I got with Pig though was something very different which wasn't particularly to my liking....

For me, Pig was slow with an almost aimless, meandering quality to it; Robin goes from place to place in search of his pig and through this journey we get to grips with events from his past that have perhaps made him the man he is today. The trouble is that nothing that happens or is revealed about his character is particularly interesting and this journey of self-discovery is pretty uninvolving.

All of the above is not helped by a very monotone performance from Cage; he's not the greatest of actors, but here it feels as though he isn't even trying. He mumbles his way through the film meaning, at times, it is difficult to decipher what he is saying half the time. The supporting cast (what little of them there are) don't fare much better. Add to this some rather lethargic direction and you've got yourself a fairly poor film.

If you don't mind films that contain little in the way of incidents/events and can handle lots of introspection then Pig may just about work. But if, like me, that sounds too heavy then I'd recommend avoiding this film.",2.0,15 April 2022
Nic Cage acts in this movie. Really.,"First of all: it is a good movie and different.

Secondly: When Nic Cage is a cultural meme and most often than not ridiculed, this movie becomes just another example that he still has ""it"", he is a good actor when there is a story and an interesting way to tell it.

""Mandy"" or ""Color Out of Space"" were similar endeavors.

It's good to watch something where not everything is told but left for imagination, too. The movie does have a little artistic feel and an indie vibe - making it better.

Sure, it's a Nicholas Cage movie, different level of subtle crazy, but with the layered portrayal of loss, sheltered pain, grief and brokenness.

The film is probably not for the high profit, it's more about filmmaking and giving something to the cinema-goers/armchair watchers they can take with themselves.

Totally unexpected in the best way,"Not at all what I expected. Nicholas Cage's career just keeps getting more interesting and I'm loving the projects he's involved with; some hits and misses but always inventive. Pig is absolutely not in keeping with Cage's recent more tongue in cheek work, this is 90% serious drama. It was sad and touching and looked absolutely beautiful on screen. The slowly building relationship between Cage's character and his unlikely sidekick is so well crafted and they are both easy to root for. What I loved most is how little exposition there was, just enough is said or shown for you to know the emotions that are driving the characters.

"definition of slow burn, but it does burn, with sullen emotion and character, and a confused sense of realism","The headline says it all. This movie is, through and through, a drama. There is no suspense, no thrills, no action. But it isn't necessarily boring. Just slow, and nonetheless powerful. The acting is great, from Nicholas Cage to Alex Wolff and a small (but notable) appearance by Adam Arkin. The script is excellent and the production raw and crisp. Music is mostly on point, too. Some scenes drag unnecessarily, and even at 92min the movie feels like it could've been 80 without the loss of anything. Nonetheless an especially powerful ending, my only major critique beyond the slowness is the confused concept of realism. The grittiness portrays a tangible realism that holds your senses captive, and even the story itself, while a little on the exaggerated side of artistic, or dare I say poetic, feels plausible. Then there's the main character and his absence of cleanliness: for 2 or 3 days steady, as the movie progresses, he wears the same blood on his face and in his beard, the same exposed cuts and dirt. He goes into top tier restaurants with white walls and pristine dining (no, he wouldn't be allowed to enter), nobody bats an eye at his appearance and it takes eons for anyone to ask about his condition. He talks to a child by an open door for five minutes and never is noticed (unrealistic or just bad parenting?). That whole aspect felt so absurd and silly, just to cater to the grimy and painful aesthetic of the main character. Aside from that, great slow paced drama.",8.0,16 August 2021

It's a slow-burning character builder and not at all what you'd expect from a story about a man going after the people who stole his pet. It's not a revenge film... it's more about how to use your wits than your fist. It's slow... but very worth the watch. Every actor in it was wonderful.

Anyway I read the blurb and though ok it's basically Taken, but instead of his daughter they kidnap his favorite pig...and he'll go around smashing heads to get it back!

This movie has no business being as good as it is,"I went into it with low expectations because I sometimes watch bad Nic Cage movies to blow off steam. This movie is so raw and emotional and reminded me that Nic Cage is actually a phenomenal actor. The premise is absurd and you'd expect it to be either like John Wick or some sort of silly comedy but what you get is a raw emotional drama with existential and grief handling tones. It's a beautiful movie and I'm utterly shocked that it unfolded the way it did. The supporting actor, Wolff, did a tremendous job as well.

The fight club scene was out of place with the rest of the movie so I'm taking off a couple of stars. For some, it would definitely be too slow and it does lack a bit of resolution on certain matters. If you are looking for something fast paced or action driven, this is not for you.

We still believe, every Nicolas Cage movie needs to be seen, as none will ever be better than National Treasure, but, I don't know if anyone else can see it, but we really get a sense of direction from Mr. Cage from Con Air.

Nicholas Cage reminds everyone that he is a top-notch actor, kind of becoming a William Dafoe in this film.

The redemption of a forgotten actor?,"Not so long ago Adam Sandler showed us in ""Uncut Gems"" that he has indeed some good acting skills, and now one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, the face of countless memes and running jokes throughout the web makes a statement with Pig.

In his own words, Nicolas Cage went away from the Hollywood spotlight because apparently he wanted to be out of the constraints that big budget commercial movies bring upon actors sometimes, and he went for the independent world.

He did a lot of them (I mean a lot!) and according to most reviews (although I didn't had the chance to check the actual movies) there wasn't much quality for the past decade. Myself, I haven't since Nicolas in a movie for a long time and the ones I saw were forgettable with the exception of ""Leaving Las Vegas""

And now what can I say, his performance in Pig is probably the best one I've seen from him, and if you had questions about his acting capabilities, if he was just a mediocre overacting individual or an actual talented actor who for whatever reason on a regular basis doesn't choose the best projects - your mind will be set once you see this movie.

I have to say that I had different expectations as to what this movie would portray, but that shouldn't affect its execution.

It's a slow paced movie yet it's interesting, the way they unveil the characters past and motivations, and while moving slowly it doesn't stop to be interesting.

The main characters develop an interesting dynamic, and Cage's performance keeps you drawn as to what will he do next. Again by the end, the motivations and overall movie goal are made clear, it has more of a metaphorical lesson rather than being about a kidnapped pig and the adventure to bring it back, so don't expect a John Wick type of movie.

I still believe it could have more depth and be more about the connection of man and nature, yet it's study about human feelings and how we can overcome the darkest tragedies in our life's.",8.0,9 August 2021

Am I crazy or what?,"I don't get all the praise this movie is getting. Coming from a pretty big Cage fan too. There is not much here to be amused by. The trailer was more than lackluster but I was still interested in giving it a watch anyways just because I had nothing better to do and like I said; I like Cage.

Right off the bat you are thrown into this movie and it's dark as heck. If you can look past that then you may think you are in for a entertaining ride. Wrong. Rest assured the beginning of this movie is about as entertaining as it gets. From then on it really just gets duller and duller. A man trying to track down his pig going from one lead to the next until he finally discovers who took it and why. This is not your typical Cage action packed movie. In fact he doesn't even scream in this one. Sometimes it's nice to try something different but at least make it watchable.

As the story progresses many things happen that don't have any rhyme or reason and it moves at a pretty slow pace. Sure not every movie has to be guns blazing and move quickly but you have to shake it up and the farthest this movie goes is in the relationship between the characters. There are a few scenes that stand out but unless you like watching paint dry and love melodramas then this movie is not for you.

Then when you finally get to the ending which you could see coming from pretty far away, you are left feeling like really? That's it? There could have at least been some kind of payoff for spending all that time and there isn't. Sure the movie is shot well. Sure it can be seem as somewhat artistic. But there just isn't anything here to warrant the praise it is getting.

This movie in my eyes is run of the mill. 4-5 at best on a good day. And anybody claiming Cage deserves an award for this one is cracked out of their minds. He doesn't even speak that much in here. Let alone plays a role that could even come close. I don't know if people are obsessed with pigs and love his relationship he had with his pet or what but that doesn't make this a good movie.",4.0,25 July 2021

On a bonus both the cinematography and sound design are outstanding, world class. Some of the camera shots are incredible and really bring the script to a whole new level. Nicholas Cage and Alex Woolf have a surprising amount of chemistry especially in the slower scenes. It misses out on 10 because of a few weak performances from side characters, and occasional weak acting by Cage and Woolf. That's only knit picking though, an all-round must watch for genuine lovers of film as an art.",9.0,2 August 2021

Pig is a beautiful production.,"Today I watched a movie called ""Pig"" and it starred Nicolas Cage. The very same Nicolas Cage whose spate of film choices over the last 10 years ... can best be described as spotty.

Pig is a small film; about a man who hunts truffles with his pig in the wilds of Oregon's Forrest's. He's a hermit whose life is a self enforced solitude. He doesn't want to know you; he doesn't want to meet anyone he doesn't have to.

But when someone kidnaps his prized porker (a truffle pig) an unexpected man of determination emerges from exile and begins the hunt for his ""truffle pig"" thru the gastronomic wilds of the ""Portland Restaurant Scene."" Slowly we begin to learn that Cage's character has depth.

This isn't the typical Cage shoot'em up. His acting is subtle and genuine. His speech/dialogue is sparse and effective.

In short ""PIG"" is a beautiful film and Nicolas Cage's performance is the stuff of legend.",10.0,10 August 2021

About what I expect from Nick Cage these days,"What happened to Nick Cage? He's appeared in *anything* since his tax problems blew up in 2009, and he's not been exactly what you'd call ""discerning"" in his choice of roles. ""Pig"" is just another in a long line of ""Oh, My God, How Did This Get Green Lit?"" films that substitute pretentious writing and directing for substance (although I will give them that this is the first time a pig has upstaged its co-star since ""Babe""). While it isn't as inexplicably awful as ""Mandy,"" it failed to draw me in at all. Characters are more annoying than interesting, and I realized less than halfway into the story that I couldn't care less about a single one of them. Poor guy. He's not a great actor to begin with, but he's obviously desperate for a paycheck, and ""Pig"" is a sad example of how the mighty have fallen. Pass on this one - it's dreadful.

The 'John Wick' of Chef Movies,"Well-acted by all, especially Nicolas Cage, but very slow and slight, with no great surprises or wisdom to impart, and ends only a few shuffling steps from where it began. Not a single memorable line in the whole thing, either.

I was interested by the premise and liked that it took a gentler turn than I'd expected, focusing much more on healing than revenge, but the briefly bizarre 'Fight Club'-esque violent turn in the middle of a movie about truffle-hunting and high-end cookery was wildly misjudged and really only highlighted the preposterousness of the story as a whole.

The film it most reminds me of is Lynch's 'The Straight Story', which I felt similarly about, but if you thought that one was the bee's knees, you might like this one too.",5.0,9 December 2021

Um...What?,"I'm not entirely sure why there's so many raving reviews about such a dull and unrewarding film. The first 15 minutes felt promising. The premise seemed interesting enough, there's some nice shots in the opening... Then the pignapping happens and it's all downhill from there. Countless drawn out sequences of pointless and completely disengaging dialogue. There's nothing even remotely thrilling going on which is sort of the whole point of being in the ""thriller"" genre. Nic Cage is DECENT, but his character isn't really interesting at all, and doesn't seem to become any more interesting as you learn more about him. He spends the majority of the movie wandering around Portland with his face covered in blood, rambling about earthquakes, persimmon trees, and curtains until he remembers he's supposed to be finding his prized pig. It's...quite mind numbing.

Anything this film tries to say about love and loss is completely overshadowed by boring dialogue, lack of purpose, and utter randomness. I don't know what I missed that seemed to wow so many other people but this was hard to get through and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",5.0,16 August 2021

My Dog Pig,"I would have never thought that a man's quest to find his stolen truffle pig would be so enthralling. Whatever misfortune or turn of events has lead to Cage taking all of these weird little roles, I love it. He's quickly working his way up the list of most captivating screen presences in Hollywood and that is really highlighted by some of these roles that normally don't get an actor with his name recognition.

Pig is a great example of this. It's such a small, tight little movie about a truffle farmer who has his prized pig stolen from him and then ventures out to get it back. The whole time, I'm expecting this to turn into the porcine Taken and it knows that, the whole way through it knows exactly what the audience is expecting and it subverts it every step of the way in wonderful fashion. Because this movie isn't about vengeance, it's a story about love and loss and the nature of life. About how we overcomplicate things in hopes of improving them when sometimes the simple things bring the greater joy.

I really can't overstate how entrancing this was for me. I had no idea what this was when it started beyond Nic Cage has his pig stolen and goes to get it back. I was expecting insane, Cage-ian antics the whole way through but the methodical and beautiful cinematography really drew me in and held me to every scene. Which isn't to say there are no weird moments. It's a Nic Cage movie, there's gonna be a couple of odd moments but even those somehow feel like they build this character and his worldview, his state of being.

Very strongly recommend this. While not being a perfect movie by any means I feel like the inherent beauty of it, the performance from Cage and the way it just speaks to the soul of this man were so unexpectedly incredible that I can't think to do anything but recommend it.",8.0,21 January 2022

"Glorious masterpiece, movie of the century without a doubt","This is hands down, simply the most fantastic film I've ever set my eyes on. Loaning the idea from the John Wick series was a brilliant move of artistry. So first off Nic Cage is an easy shoo-in for best actor at the Oscars for this, no debate. Gotta think my man Alex Wolff gets one for being able to put up with that acting genius for 90 mins jfc. The pig didn't do enough imo to merit any major award but maybe best supporting actor, best sound...definitely makeup and hairstyling down easy. The cinematography was to die for, literally the single best performance from a crew I've seen in my life. I really thought the lighting and directing was fantastic, and don't get me started on the visual effects. Absolutely positively brilliant work. Second to none, maybe Lamb but we gotta see how good that is ufm. Personally, I think they could've used more sound effects and music to go along with the scenes, as some lacked a certain intrinsic value of the auditory sort to match the setting and mood being portrayed. Overall, I thought this was a virtuoso and should be mandatory to show this masterpiece to kids in school.",10.0,30 July 2021

A wonderful walk on the weird side,"It's understandable to compare this movie with Nomadland. Both deal with outsiders who, for various reasons that are semi-revealed during the course of the movie, have turned their backs on ""normal"" society.

In the case of Pig, Nicolas Cage plays a forest recluse who lives frugally and ekes out a living by finding and selling truffles to a young Camaro-driving middleman. His only companion is a pet pig who follows him everywhere and for which he cooks very nice meals. He loves the pig. Dog lovers will understand.

One day his beloved pig is stolen. He goes to town to hunt down the perpetrators. He starts by hooking up with a community of itinerant truffle farmers. From there he re-enters - painfully -- the urban society he left 10 years before.

Gradually, as is the case with Nomadland, past secrets are revealed as the details of the past unfold.

While I found Nomadland to be sad and depressing (though well produced and acted) I found Pig to be simultaneously puzzling and entertaining. It is beautifully photographed. Both inside and outside scenes are carefully framed and shot and make excellent use of lighting conditions of all kinds. At least one scene reminded me of Edward Hopper's Nighthawks painting; I can't believe that was accidental.

What carries the movie is Nicolas Cage's performance. This is not the chew-the-scenery Cage we've grown to love. Instead we have a toned down but tightly coiled loner who as he goes about his business transmits both strength and vulnerability. Cage does a great job with the part and deserves a lot of credit for carrying this movie on his shoulders. He's on-screen almost constantly.

Pig will not be everyone's cup of tea. It's very weird at times but is never boring. If you're looking for something that is not run-of-the-mill, check it out.",9.0,9 September 2021
A poetic contemplative drama featuring a great Nicolas Cage performance (in the traditional sense),"Pig is a quiet contemplative indie arthouse drama featuring a standout performance from Nicolas Cage, his best in years.

Rob, a truffle hunter living off the grid in the Oregonian wilderness, returns to Portland and confronts his past to search for his beloved truffle pig, which has been stolen from him.

First-time writer-director Michael Sarnoski takes a minimalist approach. The story is divided into three chapter titles or more rather, three meal servings, working much like a haiku. It's in between those empty spaces where we learn about Nicolas Cage's silent character Rob, who stands as an enigmatic figure from beginning to end. We are not directly informed in detail about what happened to Rob and must fill in the blanks ourselves.

Pig succeeds at being larger than the sum of its parts. Its plot has been compared to John Wick as both begin with a man who has their pet taken away from them. It only fits as a loose comparison. As Pig's main plot unfolds, we see that Rob's retrieval of his beloved missing pig is not the true journey. The B story underneath expresses what the film truly wants to tell, which is a story about grief.

Pig, on its abstract poetic level, muses on other themes like chasing your dreams versus selling out for money and living a meaningful life and having satisfaction in what you do. The film is a rewarding experience giving you a lot to take away from and self-reflect on afterward.

Nicolas Cage delivers his most disciplined and subtle performance in years, at least in the conventional sense of what performance and subtlety are. As Rob, he holds back and underplays with great precision, pulling the audience in wondering the enigma of his character.

Cage has never been bound by convention and seems determined to play jazz with every conceivable acting style under the sun. He's explored the traditional method of immersing himself deep in a role and on the opposite end, also made an art out of taking the audience out of a moment.

Cage reportedly signed onto Pig to remind the audience that he can act. He accomplishes that here. Is this a return to form? I believe if Nicolas Cage felt so inclined, he could easily just choose his next three projects that can ""show he can act"" and the media will be praising his return to form soon enough (Hashtag ""Cageaisance""). If it's up to Cage's whimsy... this can be his comeback. I sure hope so.",8.0,15 March 2022

A masterpiece of a film that prefers quiet introspection to bombastic revenge and comeuppance,"When I heard ""Nicolas Cage hunts for his stolen truffle pig"" as the synopsis of this movie, I laughed. I laughed long and heartily and thought of course this is a movie that would star Nic Cage, I'm not wasting my time with that.

Sometimes it's ok to be wrong.

Pig, the debut feature from writer/director Michael Sarnoski is a touching, minimalist story that shows the lengths a man will go in order to save a loved one. In this case, that loved one is his truffle pig, and while some may sneer or be baffled by the concept, the early bond established between the two justifies our protagonist's steadfastness in seeing this wrong righted. The movie is split into three parts, each named after a dish made in that section (Rustic Mushroom Tart, Mom's French Toast and Deconstructed Scallops, and A Bird, A Bottle and A Salted Baguette), and shows the journey of Robin Feld and Amir as they enter the shady underbelly of Portland's high end restaurant industry to find answers as to who has stolen Robin's pig. While the story of the odd pair forced to work together to achieve a goal is a well-trod trope of storytelling, it's a rare instance that the trope is used to have one character subtly push the other to become a better human being. That's the mastery of Pig; the layers of personality of our two main characters are slowly stripped away until all that's left is the very core of who they are (or could be).

Pig features two extremely powerful performances from Nicolas Cage and Alex Wolff. Cage, unfortunately known for starring in a lengthy run of less-than-stellar direct-to-video movies, proves once again exactly why he's an Academy Award winner. His role as Robin Feld, a recluse happy to be left in the woods until he's forced to reenter society, is a testament to the acumen that Cage possesses as an actor. While he's been quietly putting in solid work over the last few years (Mandy, Color Out of Space), Pig is his grand reintroduction to the world as a person at the top of their craft, not the punchline to a joke. Alex Wolff goes toe-to-toe with Cage, holding his own as Amir, Robin's truffle broker. Wolff plays Amir with a cocksure bravado at the beginning of the film, using material objects as a flimsy masking tape to hide his glaring insecurities. While Robin's transition throughout the film is marked by gentle subtleties, Amir's are incredibly overt, giving Wolff the chance to really showcase his talents. Adam Arkin as the film's antagonist is equal parts smug and smarm, delightfully digging into the script and delivering a character ruled by greed and ambition. While not in the movie long, his presence looms over the film long before he's introduced in the second act, and Arkin makes use of every scene.

Written and directed by Michael Sarnoski, with the assistance of Vanessa Block with whom he developed the story, Pig makes for a remarkable directorial debut. At 92 minutes, it packs a lot of story into its scant runtime. Weaving the main plot of Robin Feld's search for his stolen pig with Amir's personal issues, the film is almost perfectly paced. Robin's relationship with his pig is quickly cemented and believable; only 11 minutes pass before his peaceful, serene life is violently interrupted. Cinematographer Patrick Scola is deserving of praise as well; his and Sarnoski's decision to use a healthy amount of natural light to frame daytime scenes gives the movie an authentic feel while managing to showcase the not-quite-sunny-not-quite-dreary nature of Portland, Oregon.

Overall, Pig is a masterpiece of a film that prefers quiet introspection to bombastic revenge and comeuppance. Nic Cage's transition from surly grizzled loner to a humane, compassionate man proves that he's still a powerful actor capable of nuance and restraint. Outstanding writing and direction from Michael Sarnoski combined with top notch performances make this possibly the best Neon production to date, as well as one of the best films of 2021 overall. A great movie leaves the audience wanting to know more about the characters after the end credits: do they ever reach the goals they were working towards? Will they interact with each other again? In the case of Pig, we know they will and it saddens me that we'll never get to see that interaction, sweet as it's guaranteed to be. Pig is playing in theaters July 16th.",8.0,23 January 2022

Pig,"Upon my first viewing of this film, I didn't care too much for what was presented. However, after watching it for a second time, my opinion has become mixed. Where the film succeeds in the aspects of its powerful lead performance as well as its artistic and meaningful effort, the film fails in detrimentally crucial areas. Although Nicolas Cage is known for his emotionally loud performances, in this film he delivers a subdued portrayal of his character, showing the actor's incredible range of how he's able to express and project his roles. However, whereas Cage's portrayal shines in every aspect, his co-stars deliver performances that feel pretentious and uncanny, leading to characters that feel overall unnatural. Although the film can be respected for its immense effort in telling an artistic story with rich meaning and powerful themes, the film falters by creating an inconsistent tone with gritty, dramatic scenes in some areas, and unbelievable situations presented in others. After watching this film for the second time, I have found a new respect for the ambition that was implemented within the overall story and performance. However, the film fails in moments where it needed to shine the most leading towards an average, pretentious independent film.",5.0,28 February 2022

I can hold onto the love a man can have for a pet and what he'd be willing to do to reunite with a lost/stolen animal, that's universal, but the path taken is so far-fetched it lost my focus multiple times and especially toward the end. I started thinking this was a 7/10 but the more I thought about it, it just kept losing points.

However, when it comes to motives of the characters, it's difficult to understand why one character did this or that or didn't. At the end, you confront with a lot of possibilities. Most of them are meaningless. Even strongest possibility is meaningless. The film includes lots of ""why""s, on the other side answers almost nothing.

If you have seen one you have seen them all,"...is what they previously said about Nicolas Cage varieties of facial expressions. And for 99% of this movie this is also true (one exception aside - which then hits in 3 times as good just for the surprise that he DOES HAVE a second expression).

To make things worse: compared to the storyline, depth of characters, etc, Nicolas Cage actor capabilities are super star material. It literally NEVER manages to pull you in and while you (for whatever reason) still hope that something changes and comes back for the money you spend on the movie - it suddenly ends.

This little piggy went to market...,"This is a film about power, and the two things that the powerful fear most of all: love and respect. Because deep down the powerful know that they can have everything except those two things.

I like Nicholas Cage and I like his films. I think he's hopeless as an actor and his films are generally trash. This is no exception, so I'm happy about that. I enjoyed it in a Nicholas Cage kind of way. He's actually quite good in this because he does even less acting than usual; the plot required that he didn't wash or speak to anyone for ten years and he's pretty convincing in that respect.

It should be a beautiful film, but it falls short. It manages to be a thoughtful film -just about. It feels like the American re-make of a much better French film starring Eric Cantona and set in the Ardennes. Juliett Binoche would be in the original, though I'm not sure how. And Gerard Depardieu if he's even still alive.

The cinematography is top notch. Even the direction is pretty good. But the sound... it wrecks the film. SPEAK UP, Nicholas! STOP MUMBLING for Godssake! The script is random and obtuse and probably profound, but you need perfect ears and I haven't got perfect ears.

There's a pig in it.",5.0,9 December 2023

The mere fact that it isn't canonical doesn't make it good.,"If you liked: You Were Never Really Here First Cow First Reformed

""Pig"" is a 2021 extremely low-budget film with what looked like a peculiar and interesting idea for a plot. It was shot in only 20 days, and all actors had to get everything right from the first time as there was no budget for re-shoots or delays. It tells a story of Rob - a hermit truffle hunter (Nicholas Cage still acts??), whose truffle pig gets stolen during the first 10 minutes of the movie. It is then slowly revealed that Rob has some burdensome and shady past, as he and his buyer (Alex Wolff; ""Hereditary"") try to get the pig back. During this little adventure the film turns into a meditative philosophical tale about loss, humanity and human relationships, rather than merely about retrieving a pet pig. It has a strange, almost dream-like poetic-wannabe structure, and gives off a whiff of some global depression that is well-known to each and every human being on this planet.

The film is far from cliché, but even further from groundbreaking or remarkable (reminded me a lot of ""Minari"" and ""First Cow"" in that regard). The mere fact that it isn't canonical unfortunately doesn't make it good; under the mask of deep philosophical questions lies an extremely simple idea that could have been expressed in a 10-minute short film. The only truly great things are the performances of both Cage and Wolff: Cage showing that he still can deliver an emotional performance; and Wolff once again proving that he has many great roles ahead of him.
