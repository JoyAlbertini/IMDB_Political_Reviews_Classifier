    "reviewBody": "Easily one of the best horror prequels. The original Omen is an all time classic, and this is a great follow up. The film revels in mashing up genres: body horror and gothic church horror. Well paced with a good cinematic moment.\n\nSynopsis: When a young American woman is sent to Rome to begin a life of service to the church, she encounters a darkness that causes her to question her own faith and uncovers a terrifying conspiracy that hopes to bring about the birth of evil incarnate.\n\nWhen a young American woman is sent to Rome to begin a life of service to the church, she encounters a darkness that causes her to question her own faith and uncovers a terrifying conspiracy that hopes to bring about the birth of evil incarnate.",
