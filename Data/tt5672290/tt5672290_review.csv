Watch this instead of Immaculate,"How can a prequel of a classic directed by a first timer (at least when it comes to feature films) be this good???

The First Omen is a must watch for it's cinematography alone. Adding Nell Tiger Free as the incredible lead, eery body horror, spectacular sets and costumes and the feeling of 70s cinema.

It might be a tid bit too long and the whole Dan Brown-esque scavenger hunt wasn't fully working, but damn is it fun and just beautiful to watch.

Arkasha Stevenson did the original Omen justice.

I have to compare it to Immaculate since it's basically the same story, but so much better! Go watch this instead, trust me.",8.0,4 April 2024
Huge surprise,"The First Omen is literally the Rogue One of horror movies. Late stage horror prequels are usually cheap cash grabs which is what makes this one such a pleasant surprise. It's clearly crafted with vision and artistry as it operates within an established franchise whilst being so much nastier than mainstream horror usually gets to be.

Nell Tiger Free is phenomenal, as the film progresses it demands more and she is always able to provide it. A late stage sequence has her going to a very visceral place and it leaves you speechless. Ralph Ineson gives Father Brennan a lot more humanity than he originally had and is great at establishing the stakes.

Arkasha Stevenson makes such a confident debut, skillfully choosing to harken back to the original not just with callbacks and musical cues but by imbuing this film with the same rich texture and slow burning pace of 70s cinema. She also crafts an atmosphere so potent that the few jump scares really land and the horrific imagery won't be forgotten anytime soon.",8.0,11 April 2024
No Jumpscares no Problem,"Finally a horror movie that doesn't rely on jumpscares every 10 seconds.

The story is of Margret who goes to an orphanage run by nuns in Italy in the 70s. She is on the road to getting her veil when we discover she was also brought up in one of those homes and was plagued by visions which she was thought that they were her imagination. When a girl starts having similar experiences she grows close to her trying to uncover the route of them. As people are losing faith in God around the world the church pose a plot to gain back their faith, going to extreme lengths, sinister lengths.

The movie is solid, it focuses on telling a story in the horror genre with about 3 jumpscares and a major lean on visual horror scenes.

The acting is good, there also seems to be a good sense of dread in the entire movie as the characters are on edge the whole time. The settings are good and the music is good. The story is a little predictable as I caught on quite quick the ""twist""

Overall an enjoyable time and I hope more of these come out as I like them not filled with Jumpscares as that gets so boring, 7.5/10.",7.0,10 April 2024
Unsettling but flawed,"Unsettling is the perfect word to describe The First Omen. This prequel to the 1971 classic maintains the atmosphere and dread of the original while adding a few of its own twists and turns to the lore for better or worse.

Exploring the dark forces behind Damien's birth is one of the best parts of the First Omen. The tension that builds up to the final act is equally as compelling. Thankfully there were only a few cheap jump scares with the film opting for more disturbing imagery. There were many scenes where you knew something was going to happen but all you could do was either watch it play out or turn away. If you do decide to stick with it you will find the graphic moments satisfyingly disturbing. The First Omen does not disappoint when it comes to fully utilizing its R-rating.

One of the worst aspects of the film is the narrative. Hauntings kind of just happen for no particular reasons and some of the changes to the lore in The Omen don't quite jive not just with the original but within the context of The First Omen itself. All of the actors did an amazing job in their respective roles but a majority of the supporting characters needed more development. Nell Tiger Free's Margaret stood out as the leading protagonist while her friend and ally priest left me wanting to know more about them.

For me, the pros outweigh the cons but the lacking story is worth considering if you are on the fence about seeing The First Omen in theaters.",6.0,14 April 2024
The First Omen: A Slow-Burn Horror with Eerie Charm,"I found ""The First Omen"" a decent horror flick. It's definitely a slow burn, so be prepared for building suspense rather than constant jump scares. The chilling atmosphere, unsettling moments, and creepy background score really worked for me.

While the pace might be too slow for some, I appreciated the way the film gradually builds tension. It has genuine scares, fueled more by atmosphere than cheap tricks. If you enjoy a classic, atmospheric horror experience, you might like this one.

Don't go in expecting a fast-paced thrill ride. Instead, be prepared for a film that aims to unnerve you. It won't blow you away with originality, but for fans of old-school horror, ""The First Omen"" offers some solid chills.",7.0,13 April 2024
"A Gruesomely Entertaining Horror Flick That Resurrects ""The Omen"" Franchise",,6.0,5 April 2024
ONE OF THE BEST HORROR PREQUELS.,"Easily one of the best horror prequels. The original Omen is an all time classic, and this is a great follow up. The film revels in mashing up genres: body horror and gothic church horror. Well paced with a good cinematic moment.

Synopsis: When a young American woman is sent to Rome to begin a life of service to the church, she encounters a darkness that causes her to question her own faith and uncovers a terrifying conspiracy that hopes to bring about the birth of evil incarnate.

Finally a worthy prequel!,"Kudos to the filmmakers for having the guts to do a straight up prequel to such a classic horror film. Rather than another re-boot, the events in The First Omen take place directly before the classic film.

The film is delightfully creepy and weird, including a sequence that legitimately gave me goosebumps. Fantastic cinematography and atmosphere actually makes the film feel like it could've come out in 1971.

Not only does it give context to the original but also answered some lingering questions I had after watching the original. A prequel that is not only worthy, but actually feels necessary.",8.0,6 April 2024
Nice film but I was expecting more,,6.0,10 April 2024
Disappointing,"""The First Omen"" came out of nowhere really. It also feels like its going somewhere by the end. But unfortunately most of it is dull build up to that interesting finale.

Now i love the original Omen. It wasn't a hardcore horror or anything but was still a classic with that creepy kid and tremendous music. But this one has more or less the same ""scares"" but less.

The problem is that a modern audience expects more from horror and (outside of one scene) this film just isn't scary. Infact you'll find yourself either rolling your eyes or laughing at the bits that are supposed to be. Basically you don't even have to have seen the original to have seen all this before. Everything is very familiar and alot of the movie is very predictable.

Nell Tiger Free However is great in the movie, and if you're patient enough that last 20 minutes or so is half decent.",4.0,26 April 2024
The Antichrist Arrives!,"The First Omen: Though similar in plot to Immaculate at a superficial level, this film sticks to the supernatural in the attempts to create the Antichrist. In the prologue an aged Father Harris (Charles Dance) is tracked down by Father Brennan (Ralph Ineson), Harris relates a garbled tale about a baby created through a woman mating with the Devil. The progeny is destined to be the mother of the Antichrist. Shortly afterwards Father Harris is showered by stained glass and a piece of scaffolding takes a chunk out of his head, obviously just happenstance. Rome, 1971, Margaret (Nell Tiger Free) arrives from the US to take her vows at a school/orphanage, herself an orphan, she was raised by the Roman Catholic Church. She is met by Cardinal Lawrence (Bill Nighy) who a decade before had counselled her when she was having troubles. They travel to the Convent to the background of Trade Union and Student protests; the Cardinal reflects on how the RCC is also losing the support of young people. These disturbances continue in the background over the radio until Margaret is caught up in a riot during a pivotal scene,

The Convent seems to be a happy place, the children are treated well, they have parties, nuns bounce on trampolines, even the elder sisters smoke and crack jokes. However Margaret finds that one child Carlita (Nicole Sorace) is often kept in a room, tied to a bed even. Carlita acts up, is violent, draws strange pictures, Margaret realises that Carlita is acting like she did years ago, so she bonds with her. Similar to Immaculate there is a naughty novitiate, Luz (Maria Caballero) she browbeats Carlita into going dancing and drinking, after all one must live before leaving secular life. Things take an odd turn at the orphanage, Carlita has terrifying visions, a strange young nun, Angelica connects with both Margarey and Carlita. Father Brennan reappears and tries to convince Margaret that a conspiracy is at play to create the Antichrist. The plot now takes an interesting turn which it would be a spoiler to reveal.

The First Omen is a largely satisfying film in its own right and promises to take the franchise off at an angle to the previous films. There are scenes of graphic horror, not least in the birth scenes where elements of body horror are introduced along with Margaret's visions of the risen dead. Some good jump scares but the pacing of the film takes away from the effect of a couple of these. A tightening up of the convent scenes with additional exposition of Margaret's backstory might have improved the flow of the narrative. Nell Tiger Free's part demands a lot and she is equal to it as her character develops. Maria Caballero is wonderful in her nunsploitation role in the nightclub scenes and in her dress sense, this sequence and her later taking of vows introduces a touch of Dario Argento. Nicole Sorace gives a fine performance as the disturbed and conflicted young girl.. Bill Nighy gives further support as the enigmatic and pragmatic Cardinal. Of course The First Omen introduces a few characters who featured in the 1976 film The Omen and even pays homage to several of its gory death scenes (improving on at least one of those). Directed by Arkasha Stevenson, who co-wrote the screenplay with Tim Smith and Keith Thomas from a story by Ben Jacoby. 8/10.",8.0,4 April 2024
"Cliche, Not scary","I like the genre and its origin, let there be no doubt. Sadly the sequel didn't scared me, yet it couldn't be gore and violent enough. Predictable plot as well which never truly disturbed unlike its prequel. Despite the promising title I was obviously too excited about, it could've been much more interesting than just chopped limbs and screaming nuns, almost disrespecting the 1976 classic. As for ancient Rome's sightseeing, it wasn't too bad to watch...

Typically, some of it reminded me of a similar plot inspired from classics like ""Rosemary's Baby"" (take note of the baby's claws). The actual first born could be just another ""Alien"" rip- off. Considering the 2006 prequel (Mia Farrow), The First Omen is actually confusing and could be just as well watched in reverse order. Ritual birth in a dungeon, the usual candle fire and crucifix, victim stripped to a gurney surrounded by complicit nuns is so cliche. Even the notorious birthmark was too predictable. Just copy paste it into the next Omen, the one after, and it's done... appropriate 6/6 rating.",6.0,10 June 2024
Dull. Nothing like the original masterpieces.,"Im a huge fan of horrors, and love the original couple of Omen films. For me they are timeless classics. They build suspense, draw you in and you just feel the evil coming from the character. This was just so completely dull. Halfway through the film i find myself checking the runtime to see if we are nearly done yet. To be fair to the film the acting was pretty good and some of the effects used were very good. Perfomances from the mighty Bill Nighy for example are rarely going to be poor, but even his skill as an actor couldnt save the dullness of this movie. Im not quite sure if the reviewers offering 7 to 9 out of ten even saw the same movie? This should have been another classic but unforunately it just fell on its face quite flatly.",3.0,28 May 2024
Meh!,,6.0,7 April 2024
Nuns aplenty,"Following on the heels of the film ""Immaculate"" about nuns giving birth to the satanic in a Catholic cult, comes the First Omen about nuns giving birth to the satanic in a Catholic cult!

However the latter is a far better production that relies less on jump scares and more on slow burn horror. Warnings of ""viscera"" were overrated as it only graphically appeared once. There was instead a clever analysis of the natural horror of the ordeal of childbirth.

The treatment of the Catholic Church was also more balanced as it clarified that most Catholics were spiritual people, and not satanic cultists.

There was even a hidden message that sin, even one night out, was not good for nuns!

Anomalies existed. Why Satan didn't like fire for example was inconsistent with the entire history of Catholicism. Also the ending was very contrived to ensure a sequel could be resurrected if needed.

The setting was an orphanage for girls run by nuns so there was an interesting archetypal ambience about motherhood, which worked very well for the film. Every version of the feminine was on hand with a cunning foxy Cardinal Bill Nighy in the henhouse, so to speak.

It was this strange analysis of everything female, and I mean everything, that was exceptional.",7.0,4 April 2024
A more sophisticated and slow approach,"In order to prepare for this movie I watched the whole Omen franchise including the terrible fourth one. To be really quick, the original is a timeless classic with some unforgettable scenes, the sequel is also a solid movie, the third movie is quite different but still a decent watch, the fourth one is atrocious and the remake is passable but does nothing new.

At first I wasn't really excited to see this movie since it was only just another addition for a franchise that didn't need more movies. It seemed like a quick cash grab like most Hollywood movies nowadays. But after the first reviews came out, the movie had some pretty good ratings and most people seemed to enjoy it. That made me curious and I decided to give it a watch.

The movie is definitely a more sophisticated approach and takes its time for something to happen. You have beautiful cinematography and great acting with a lot of suspenseful dragged out scenes. There is also some disturbing imagery in this that I didn't expect to be so explicit. The movie has a good atmosphere and doesn't rely on cheap jump scares, but rather focuses on a dense atmosphere and genuinely scary moments. Overall it's a decent addition to the franchise but it felt really slow at times and I think that at least 20 minutes could have been cut from the final result. There are some unnecessary scenes that are really dragged out which harms the movies pacing. Also I think it's a little forgettable and doesn't have many standout scenes. But it was a decent watch anyway and there was definitely put more thought into this than most other movies that come out today, especially if they are part of a franchise and especially in horror.

Came out of nowhere!,"This movie came out of nowhere (at least for me).

It has really good acting, excellent soundtrack and awesome scenes/images. CGI could have been better but it really doesn't affect the movie.

I recently watched the trailer when I went to see Kong and Godzilla and thought it was really interesting and intriguing. I was hoping it wasnt going to be a 4.5 rating on IMDd and I'm glad to say this movie should no go below 6.0 raiting.

Now days when it comes to ""horror"" we are so used to movies like the nun 2, the conjuring 3, Insidious 5, movies that have no substance or story telling.

If you have the option to go to your movie theater and watch then Watch it! Jaja.",8.0,5 April 2024
"Not quite immaculate, but really solid NUNtheless","'The First Omen (2024)' is surprisingly good for a prequel to a horror classic. It's also remarkably similar to 'Immaculate (2024)', to the point that one would seem to have ripped off the other if it had been released significantly later (the tiny gap between the two films' release dates indicates a case of parallel thinking, rather than plagiarism). Its most valuable asset is its direction, which makes use of assured cinematography and measured pacing to deliver some really well-achieved sequences that are typically as unsettling as they are atmospheric. The picture is often dripping with dread, evoking this intangible sense that what you're seeing is actually evil. With an unrelentingly ominous soundtrack, some really confronting imagery and the overall texture - both aesthetic and narrative - of something straight out of the seventies, the film carves its own unholy mark on the genre and is often really compelling (even during its more obviously silly moments). Its pacing does wane slightly in its second act, and its central mystery - or, at least, where it's heading - is unfortunately really obvious if you've seen 'The Omen (1976)' (or even read the tagline). I guessed the movie's major twist within the first few moments, for instance, and being ahead of the narrative doesn't do the experience any favours considering its enigma is pretty much its main driving force. Even if you aren't able to see the reveal coming, the film's main problem still has a strong impact. The issue is that it has to tie in to the original, which severely diminishes the potential - and power - of its third act. The finale just feels incredibly boxed in, and it doesn't help that the flick isn't content to just strongly imply. Instead, it feels the need to spell out, with a rushed epilogue that ends on a namedrop that's intended to carry weight but actually just feels weird. It's not as if the rest of the movie is exactly subtle, but the climax feels like a total sledgehammer in the worst possible way (not in terms of its in-universe implications, but its meta ones). It's bending to the studio's idea of what it needs to be, rather than what it it's been naturally building towards. However, this obviously top-level interference isn't enough to significantly reduce the overall effectiveness of the affair. It's still a really accomplished in-the-moment experience, despite its legitimate narrative issues. The direction really is rock-solid, as are most of the performances, and there's a palpable sense of foreboding throughout. A lot of the set-pieces are rather unsettling, too. It's ultimately a strong effort that suffers most from being part of a wider franchise, yet is also far better than you may expect an entry in said franchise to be. If its third act was a little better, it could have been great. As it is, it's still really good.",7.0,8 April 2024

A modern horror that truly captures 1970's Horror,"GO SEE THIS MOVIE ! I went in to this film with very low expectations! I came out of this film being utterly blown away . As a director, Arkasha Stephenson has truly nailed making a prequel! She's nailed and captured the look , feel and terror of Horror movies from the 1970's ! She's appealed to both an older generation and a younger generation of movie goers. Used a big named 3 person cast to its fullest , and introduced a stunning, relatively unknown lead and supporting cast to its fullest. Beautifully shot, framed, paced and sympathetically made a movie that's on par with all the greats from this era and at the same time done justice to the original film in every way and told a story that links so perfectly in to the original film , I can't quite believe it . It's not often I leave the cinema gobsmacked , but today I did . Go watch this film , go support the movie and its director , go support horror movies and go tell your friends to see it . If you are one of those saying , it's not scary , it wasn't gory , or as I heard 2 teenagers leaving the cinema say "" I didn't know what to make of that , it wasn't as good as Megan , you need to go have a word with yourself as to why you watch horror , what horror you've seen and what a horror film is ! Because this was near perfection !",10.0,5 April 2024
This movie was had lots of great moments. And some other moments too...,"First off.. The movie was not horrible. It had its moments where my jaw was dropped. And mind you it is a 2-hour long movie. So those moments felt heavy

Nell Tiger Free was marvelous in many moments, however I feel as thought she sometimes missed the Q. But there were moments I could not take my eye off of her. In fact, please if they ever remake Possession (1981), cast her.

As much as I love these movies separately, they do not belong in the same movie(toward the end, it felt like I was more-so watching Possession rather then anything related to The Omen)

Ishtar Currie Wilson!!!!!! I NEED TO SEE YOU IN MORE HOROR IMMEDIATELY. YOU WERE CRAZY AND LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT!!!! WHICH IS WHY I WANTED MORE OF ANGELICAS STORY!

I feel it would have worked better for a movie like a remake, of Possession. Sorry!

As I said it has its moments. Visual effects were outrageously delightful and that it itself is worth giving it a go. A little bit better script, shorter run time and support would have made it a solid Omen.",7.0,5 April 2024

"Best Omen movie since the first, original movie from 1976.","The First Omen is a prequel to the first Omen film from 1976. This prequel is directed by Arkasha Stevenson. This is her film directorial debut, before which she has only directed episodes of various TV series.

The young American Margaret (Neil Tiger Free) has been sent to Italy to live in the service of the church. During her time at the church, she learns about hidden, dark actions at the church as they seek to bring the Antichrist to life.

With this prequel they respond well to the original Omen film from 1976. This original film has already had sequels, spin-offs and a remake. All these films after the original Omen often did not work very successfully, but this new prequel seems to change that after years. With this prequel they respond well to the story that happened before the original film. They know how to create a good, exciting, but also equal atmosphere with this new Omen film. The only disadvantage of the fact that the film responds so well to the original Omen film is that it can make this prequel a bit predictable at times. As a connoisseur of the classic Omen film, you can anticipate this prequel.

In addition to the predictable aspects that the film can have for connoisseurs, the film also has an incorrect outcome date. This film is very similar to the horror film Immaculate, which was released in cinemas a week earlier. Due to the similar horror stories, it can feel a bit repetitive when you see these two films in two weeks in a row.

With horror aspects, with this film they do not play much on horror clichés such as lame jump scares, but manage to create a more religious horror atmosphere around the birth of the Antichrist. This is not a sadistic body horror film, but focuses more on the aspects involved in birth. They seem to have used so many real effects for this, which also made some more of the cast members ragged.

Nell Tiger Free also carries this film as the lead, who learns about dark secrets in her church. Together with the other cast members, she and the rest play the characters well and appropriately enough, making it seem like they are also from the 1976 film.",6.0,7 April 2024
What movie were you remaking?,"I'm going to rate this movie 7 but really give it 2 ratings As a horror movie: 8 As an Omen movie: 2

Let me say first that the original Omen is my favorite horror movie. Rosemary's baby, for several reasons, is my most hated horror movie

What we have here is a good take on Rosemary's baby.

Let me explain without spoilers why this isn't an Omen movie. The signature of the Omen franchise is that the deaths occur with a Rube Goldberg clockwork precision (later incorporated in the Final Destination films) coupled with an Alan Silvestri soundtrack that conveyed intent and malice. In short, it was clear that Satan was watching over his son. There were also cumbersome rules about how a mortal could kill the antichrist, all making for great tension.

The preview for this film hinted at this with scenes filmed in reverse....not in the movie. The first 2 deaths pay obvious homage to the original movie but lack the malice and intent. Later scenes don't even try

The final scene appears to take place 3-5 years after the rest of the story, making the final line laughably obsolete

There may be a plan to implement a parallel series of stories even as Omen 2 and maybe 3 happen undisturbed out of sight. If so, that could be fun storytelling. But unless they retcon the retcon, they won't be Omen storys.",7.0,6 April 2024
Decent movie with major flaws!,,6.0,28 May 2024
Absolutely brilliant,"The opening scene captured the eeriness of the originals. Yet this is a masterful film in its own right. Brilliantly executed by cast and crew, the editing is fantastic as are the performances. Nell Tiger Free has a scene reminiscent of Isabelle Adjani's subway scene in Possession (1981). She does a good job as lead, though I can see some of her work in Servant (2019) seep into her character here, so she still has some way to go as an actor-artist. Nonetheless she carries the film well and creates a believable performance.

The story is well crafted and the pace is good, I didn't once look at my watch for the duration of the film. In fact I wanted it to go on for longer.

It's rare these days to have such an enjoyable experience with horror at a cinema. Highly recommended and I hope to see a sequel to this.",9.0,4 April 2024

Pales In Comparison To The Original,"Other than the opening scene, one would not even know this was a horror film for the first 45 minutes. The director needs to understand how to create an atmosphere of dread, using all the techniques available - music, camera placement, sound design, and actors to build upon each scene and increase the tension. Jump scares in horror are just cheap and lazy, and this director to the easy way out. Not only is this film not a bit frightening, but one cares very little for any of the characters. It honestly felt like an expensive student film. How this movie's budget was 30 million, I'll never know. It looked half that, at best. Stick with the original. Nothing new, here.",4.0,2 June 2024
"""The First Omen"" is a formidable film, the best horror film of the year so far.","""The First Omen"" is a film that can only be described positively, from wonderful, incredible, great, but the most accurate and correct is that the film is a masterpiece. The script is a prequel that tells us the story of Damien Thorn's birth, and it does so in an effective and gloomy way, at times it seems predictable but soon there are wonderfully designed twists, as well as including tribute scenes to the first film from 1976. The director Arkasha Stevenson's work is first class, she tells this story in a slow way that is full of emotions, together with the editing work, the film gives a result of art cinema, with the vein of current classics such as ""The VVitch"" (2015), ""Heriditary"" (2018) or ""Suspiria"" (2018) to name a few. The art direction and filming locations were carefully chosen, resulting in a visual delight that the cinematography manages to exalt in each scene. The costume design transports you to the beginning of the '70s, although sometimes it falls into anachronisms such as extras who wear costumes that belong to the mid- and late '70s and not the beginning of these, there is even disco music that in 1971 had not yet been played, an example is the classic ""Daddy Cool"" by Boney M. The soundtrack by Mark Korven is an auditory delight and evokes the soundtrack he made for ""The VVitch"" in 2015. The effects are well done, it is appreciated to be able to see old school special effects, with the exception of a couple of scenes that use digital effects but decent and moderately. The makeup effects are realistic and gloomy. The film, being a co-production between the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada and Serbia, provides elements that are reminiscent of Italian cinema from the '70s, in addition to paying tribute to classics such as ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968), ""Suspiria"" (1977), ""Possession"" (1981) and remembering the atmosphere that ""The Omen"" trilogy gave a gift in its time.

The beginning of the movie is definitely on the slower side. This seemed to drag and be detrimental at first, however by the end of the movie I most certainly did not mind as it added to the story of the universe and everything came together well by the conclusion of the film.

The movies uses more stomach turning scenes which really sticks to your head. And the acting that stood out to me was the main one played by Nell tiger free who was great in her role and also father Brennan who was played by Ralph Ineson.

A good prequel to the original.,"In 1976 Richard Donner's The Omen, with Gregory Peck, had a lot of people glued to the big screen. That was for that time a good evil horror movie, even winning an academy award for music, not often a horror movie gets an award. A good soundtrack is essential to create an eerie atmosphere and in The Omen they got that right. Lots of sequels and remakes later, some good and bad, Arkasha Stevenson comes with The First Omen, a prequel to the original. I was curious about it as Damian is still a synonym my wife and I give to an evil maleducated child, half a century later. An interesting story, pleasant to follow, good acting, and again a good soundtrack made The First Omen a more than decent prequel. The fans should like it.",7.0,31 May 2024

Review The First Omen (2024),"One of the best horror movies i've ever watched, absolutely mindblowing and creepy. For characters, settings and ambience, actings even the story. The most interesting that make me creeps just not from jumpscare or story but It make me feel what will be happens if this is happened before (In reality I mean).

This contains a flashback from The Omen at 1976 and 1978. For those who haven't watched it, better you watch The Omen 1976 and 1978 first.

Unfortunately this movie may contains some disturbing and gore scenes that makes unconfortable for some audience. SO VIEWER DISCRECTION IS HIGHLY ADVISED (ESPECIALLY FOR UNDER 17)

WELL DONE 👏👏",10.0,4 April 2024
Enjoyable and creepy,"I thought this an unnecessary prequel but I actually enjoyed it a lot.

This movie has a lot going for it. The cast are great. Nell Tiger Free is good as the lead and there's plenty of great support. Sonia Braga is suitably sinister, Bill Nighy is earnest and Ralph Inneson manages to give a bit of Patrick Troughton.

Fans of the original will spot plenty of callbacks or rather, as a prequel, plenty of foreshadowing I guess.

There's a handful of jump scares but overall there's a decent sense of foreboding and tension that grows as the movie progresses. I thought Arkasha Stephenson builds the atmosphere nicely.

There's a couple of scenes slightly more graphic than you might have expected. A little less 'subtly suggested' than previous franchise instalments.

This is a decent effort.",7.0,5 April 2024
"Long, boring, unoriginal and terrible in general","I was so bored from the beginning. I was just looking for something to look at while practicing guitar, and since I had been waiting for this movie for sometime now I watched it. Boy, was I bored. This is not a horror movie. You won't get chills, no jump scares, no quality sound design to make it suspenseful, terrible choir music trying to get under your skin. But the worst thing is that it is too long. Nothing happens, a plot twist no-one cares about, and an extremely long scene without dialogue. This is a 4.5 movie at best. You can't run a movie for two hours because it is a prequel to a meh horror movie to begin with. They could have easily made it 90 minutes and cut it in a way so it wouldn't be such a hot pile of stinking you-know-what. IMDB has lost its reputation for a long time now.

The First Does Most Things Right,"LIKES:

The Atmosphere

The Acting

The Music

The Makeup

The Attention To Detail

The Story

Summary: The factor that the Omen series always captivated me, was how it makes you uncomfortable and terrified rather than using jump scares. For this film, the same devices were used to make the story haunting starting with the atmosphere of the entire film. Another dive into a European monastery that hides much behind the beautiful tapestries and art. The First Omen uses a lot of the setting to provide the scares, hiding things behind shadows at night that prey upon our fear of the unknown and what lurks in the dark. The daylight offers little relief with the muted colors and more extreme actions happening to show that the Evil One cares little for the time of the day. The addition of haunting music, with grandiose instruments blaring after a build-up of creepy undertones, just adds other levels of haunting chills that add to the suspense. These aspects are some of my favorites for the Horror genre that do so much without trying too hard to be noticed.

Playing within that setting are fantastic characters and a story to play out. Acting-wise, the cast is fantastic, bringing terror and shock to the screen at the indescribable actions being taken. Braga's performance is chilling and intense as a nun, with very little warmth, and all foreshadows what she will be serving in this role. Ineson is a great character for this world, intense, on edge, and gives a performance that makes his character questionable for what purpose he serves. And Nell Tiger Free is the star of the show and unleashes such fantastic displays of pure horror as she undertakes the trials of the group. While her screaming and dramatic persona are top-notch skills, there are other elements requiring control of her body to convey the actions needed. Her performance is real and raw, and it adds so much to the believability of the performance at hand. Alongside these performances, is stellar makeup that Hollywood applies flawlessly (most times) to bring out the negative effects such dark arts bring. And this application is used so well, unleashing so much of the terror and pain they wanted to convey. All of this goes to a respectable story that pays homage to the original movie and is kept in line with most details that the original quadrilogy required. Stevenson and her team paid close attention to detail in their design, not only getting the presentation right but designing a great story that respected the original plot well. Certainly, it's not perfect, but such efforts to capture the feel and lore of the Omen are things I like in a director, even with some of the new angles they have designed for further sequels. That's the thing that made this movie such an experience for me and why I ended up surprised at the quality of the movie.

DISLIKES:

Not Scary

The Set Up

The Pacing Near The End

Perhaps A Bit Too Copy Of The Original

The Grosser Moments.

Summary: I start my dislikes with a warrant that my current exposure to most movies in this genre has dulled my scare reflex. Thus, for those with a similar background, you aren't going to find this movie truly scary as you will unsettling. The environment may rob you of your safety, but otherwise, the movie is rather low on the things that disturb or scare me. A few rogue jump scares and the terror of lurking in the shadows were always hanging on me, but again nothing to leave my mind too upset or lingering. Only the grosser moments may have gone too far for me. I'm not the biggest on what is dubbed Body Horror, and this movie sometimes dived a bit too much into that for me. While much tamer than what A24 Studios indulges in, The First Omen still practices some disturbing shock factors involving the manipulation of anatomy to very unethical levels. Outside of those moments, the only other thing that was a letdown were elements of the story being a bit too much of a copy of the original movie. Maybe they played too safe in paying homage, maybe they were trying to set up a franchise as the modern era seems to thrive on. What I can say is, that the First Omen tries to do a bit too much in the movie to dilute some of the experiences I think they were going for. Especially at the end, the movie sort of does this unrealistic and unnatural progression that has worked for genres in the past, but for this movie felt forced and last-minute leading to lackluster inclusion and a very mundane finish. Sure, there is the artistic flair of diving into the mind, but... I can't say it was the most impressive direction after such a solid opening.

The VERDICT: The First Omen proved to be a lot better than I had expected from the trailers. It works because it understands the foundation of what made the Omen its own thing and does not try to push past that limit in the pursuit of being its unique self. Stephenson has paid respects to the lineage and captured the feel of the movie. With the great study of the story, delivering an atmosphere that is both old and new, and acting to bring it to life, this movie accomplishes much in this era or rewrites. Is it perfect? No, far from it. It doesn't deliver many unique scares for me, it falls in proximity to another movie and just feels a bit too safe at times with the scare tactics and story. Yet, the movie is certainly a step up from other remakes and is worth a look if you get a chance. Do I think it's worth the trip to the theater? In some ways yes, but in many ways no.

My scores are:

Horror: 7.0-7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0.",7.0,6 April 2024
It's well made but it borrows a lot and doesn't work as well in 2024,"The problem that religious horror has today is that audiences aren't as gullible as they were in the 70s. People actually believed this kind of stuff was possible back then from what I understand. A modern audience watches something like 'The First Omen' and finds it laughable. So the movie is almost doomed before it gets underway.

Which is a shame because it's a really well made horror movie for the most part. It takes some time to build things up and introduce its characters. It has a lead character that is grounded and easy to like and care about their fate. It has some very graphic and violent horror that is bound to be quite memorable for the average horror fan. There's a lot to like here. I would love to see director Arkasha Stevenson given another horror movie with a better story and see what she could do with it.

I would say though that there is a lack of originality here. Countless times I saw things that were almost a direct rip from other horror films. It's one thing to be inspired, but a lot of this felt more like copy and paste. There are also quite a number of unearned jump-scares with things like a character appearing out of nowhere and placing a hand on someone's shoulder, accompanied by a loud jolt of music. It's cheap and it needs to be erased from the horror genre going forward. There's a mix of good and bad here. 6/10.",6.0,7 April 2024
"Interestingly, ""666"" in China is a number that expresses good fortune and smooth success.","From a technical standpoint, the film is very standard and well-executed. I won't comment much on the content because of cultural differences. But I'll mention an interesting cultural difference. In contemporary Chinese society, ""666"" is a very auspicious number, symbolizing smooth sailing and good fortune. Almost every Chinese person has used this number on social media. However, it's no longer trendy since it belongs to the previous generation's internet slang. It's considered outdated now. So, with all that said, do you get my point? Are all Chinese people representatives of the devil? Of course not. The use of ""666"" is now more suited for platforms like TikTok, the kind of brainwashing apps. Using a film to carry the meaning of ""666"" is a bit over the top. The lead actress did a great job; it would be nice to collaborate in the future.",6.0,30 May 2024

"The First Omen isn't Immaculate, it's actually better.","It's nice to see the Twin Movie phenomenon lives on (and apparently, is way more common than people acknowledge). Rarely though, are two films with EXTREMELY similar premises released so close together (Immaculate came out around Easter 2024, just a few weeks before this).

It's actually a fantastic opportunity to compare two takes on what is, essentially, the same story. I think Immaculate is a fine movie and the Sweeney connection and superior marketing will make it a larger success in the end. But, The First Omen, amazingly, is the better movie. Call it a surprise because rarely do these sort of movies - unnecessary entries into iconic 20th century horror franchises - really turn out well. (See, Exorcist Believer)

The First Omen, in contrast, feels like a worthy successor to the original Omen from 1976. Director Arkasha Stevenson has done something truly remarkable here; for the in-the-know movie nuts, the 1970s represents a unique and audacious era of American filmmaking that thankfully, we've begun to appreciate again. Stevenson doesn't just mimic the 1970s, but along with cinematographer Aron Morton and the entire team, RECREATES the style of 70s horror that the original Omen was such a pivotal part of. I love how we've begun to take the best aspects of the era and combined it with the technical sophistication of today.

Another thing I have to commend (and weirdly, a big issue I had with Immaculate), is the sound design. My God, is this movie worth seeing in a theater. The way the sound envelops you, the haunting whispering and chanting, the oppressive music...it feels like you're surrounded by evil and especially towards the end, creates and incredibly intense atmosphere.

That's really what this movie excels at; it expertly conveys a descent in madness and reflects the paranoia and terror of the situation extremely well. In no small part due to lead actress Nell Tiger Free, who, I have to say, blows Sydney Sweeney out of the water here with a passionate, physical, and (hopefully) star making turn. Again, especially towards the end, she does some truly amazing things. But, the entire cast is truly excellent as well; there's not a bad performance here - although I will admit the obligatory Italian friend Luz (Maria Caballero) does deliver some wonky lines here and there. Also, special shout out to Ishtar Currie-Wilson, whose relatively small role in this film is INCREDIBLE and terrifying.

As for problems with The First Omen, I do think the first half is undoubtedly the weaker one, and there are some unnecessary jump scares probably studio mandated to keep audiences ""engaged."" And while the final sequence of the film is amazing, the ending itself is a bit...well, let's just say, Marvelized. There's some unnecessary lore added to the Omen and a way-too-obvious reference that I just felt didn't need to be there.

In the great 2024 ""nun horror"" battle, The First Omen is undoubtedly the stronger movie. I think it conveys its themes of religious oppression and women's bodily autonomy better, it's scarier, it has better performances, and really captures the feel of the Omen. This is destined to be a Halloween classic.",8.0,9 April 2024
Omen prequel,"It's 1971 Rome with social protests breaking out. Novice nun Margaret Daino (Nell Tiger Free) arrives at the Vizzardeli Orphanage. She befriends isolated orphan teen Carlita and uncovers hidden secrets. Strange things are happening.

This is yet another nun-in-horror movie. It's been a month since I reviewed Immaculate (2024). This one is nothing new, but it is better. Margaret is compelling and her story doesn't have bad turns. It is structured better. Finally, the Omen IP actually helps here. The 70's feel is well done especially with the street protests. I would avoid the obvious Omen call-back like ""It's all for you."" although they do at least light her up. It skirts the line of being camp. Even as a stand-alone, this is a solid small horror.",7.0,30 May 2024
"Sigh...,.","Started off good, even had a nice twist going, but then fell off and it fell off hard. It ended up a predictable, disgusting, disgraceful and hot mess and that's to say the very least, I could go on. The main character starts to get on my nerves then the movie get very predictable and annoying. Most prequels are garbage but I actually had hope for this one and was very disappointed. The plot seemed good at the start but I guess the writers and producers didn't know what to do halfway through and just gave up. It's evident that hollywood has ran out of ideas and is crashing and burning. I don't care how many paid critics complement this movie, trust me, it's garbage.

It seemed like a well done, paint by number the numbers presentation. Did i mention that it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay too predictable? I WANted to like this movie...i'm always ready for a good movie in ANY genre but i'm sitting here watching and saying...'ok...now THIS is going to happen.

A worthy prequel,"Not the masterpiece it's being hailed as but it's certainly well made and acted.

As for gripes I felt the plot points and story were either a re tread of the original or things we have seen many many times before. Especially the kills were repeats of already iconic deaths in the original. Also some scenes were lifted directly from other films (the convulsion scene is right out of Possession). The twist was obvious from the get go and its a little too long I felt. That said I did enjoy it

Where this film shines is in its direction, cinematography and performances. It is not a jump scare ladden 14A cash out. There is a real vision and weight to every scene. Its very well crafted and executed even if some if it feels like a re tread its a very well made one. It absolutely captures the feel like 70s film making especially in the beginning. The way it flows and camera work. If you slapped it on a grainy 16mm film stock you could have fooled me. There is an artistry behind the lens here that elevates this beyond what one would expect from an Omen prequel in 2024.

The lead performance too by Nell Tiger Fell, she's outstanding.

Even with the hype I went in not expecting anything ground breaking and I don't feel we got anything we havent seen before. But what we did get is an extremely well crafted and gloomy horror flick that exceeded my expectations. Easily the best besides the original and well worth a trip to the theatre for.

6.5/10.",6.0,11 April 2024
"Respectful, stylish, largely creditable prequel","'The Omen' has suffered many a ham-fisted, disposable approach to keeping the story alive. After a much maligned, but in reality, quite worthy sequel in 'Damien: Omen II', the story seemingly concluded with the dismal 'The Final Conflict'. But then it rose from the ashes briefly by way of a very cheap and shoddy telemovie, followed years later by a glossy, but poorly approached remake and then a misguided tv series.

What a relief, then, that this prequel is made with such reverence and understanding of the themes, atmosphere, tone and subject-matter of the now truly iconic first film.

Just as diplomat, Robert Thorn (Gergory Peck) in the first film, and the teenaged Damien (Jonathan Scott-Taylor) in the second must assess unbelievable claims put to them, and come to a conclusion about The Antichrist, so must Bride-of-Christ-to-be, Margaret (Nell Tiger Free) when she touches down in Rome in 1971.

Her arrival, against student uprisings, urban decay and evident declines in public safety, also takes place in the midst of a Church-acknowledged withdrawal of modern people from it and its teachings. Beginning work at the convent, Margaret not only notices a strange girl treated badly by the other Sisters, but is told by Father Brennan (Ralph Ineson) - in a preface of what he will later say to Robert Thorn in 'The Omen' - that bad things will happen and - incredibly - what they will mean. Thus begins her own personal journey to assess his claims.

Directed with care, restraint and evident respect by Arkasha Stevenson in her feature debut, 'The First Omen' unfolds gradually, visually steeped in the archaeological and religious history of Rome and the Catholic Church - so palpable you can almost smell it. Aerial vistas, rapid zooms, grainy visuals and astonishing use of locations and costuming, as well as character scripting and acting, add to the carefully calibrated cinematic experience and incredible sense of its time. As mystery and tension slowly mount, it often brings to mind Luca Guadagnino's version of 'Suspiria' and Roman Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby'.

The original and its initial sequel were very much set in the real world - thrillers more than horror films. And for a long time (save an opening sequence with a wobbly leadlight window being installed) this film takes the same approach, though it is punctuated by occasional horror movie 'visions' that would only have been described, rather than shown, in its cinematic precursors. Certainly effective, they - coupled with a series of 'Omen' killings that are virtually reruns of the first film - give the sense of cheapening proceedings, if only slightly. (We do, after all, indisputably know what we are dealing with now.) Then there is the touch of narrative revisionism built into the script, with which purists may take umbridge (other film franchises have done far far worse) and a closing sequence that is perhaps too spelled out.

Nevertheless, 'The First Omen' is refreshing - a very cinematic, lovingly made, well acted reboot that takes itself and its famous source material very seriously - and to the greatest extent, pulls it off.",7.0,8 April 2024

Creepy and unsettling with potential but lacks scares.,"4 out of 5 stars.

The First Omen is a good supernatural horror film which is a prequel to the Omen that follows a anti christ child Damien. It follows Margaret going into Rome with the other girls converting there lives to god. Only to discover something sinister happening within that church.

It has a great cast ensemble. The film has a creepy premise with a girl being victim to a devil producing a child. Hoping it is a boy to be the anti christ. The birthing scene was creepy. The films tone and direction was good with its unsettling tone. It does lack scares and thrills. Overall, it is a good film with the lack of scares.",8.0,6 June 2024
Rosemary's Baby but with a twist,"As it stated on the title this prequel of Richard Donner's the Omen is sharing some noticeable parallels with the 68's Rosemary's Baby. Such as the Emergence of Anti-christ,satanist cults etc.

To be honest this movie particularly made me feel extremely sick to my stomach. Use of grotesque and graphic scenes were quite unsettling. Be warned.

That being said the director Arkasha Stevenson has done a good job with her theatrical feature debut.

I'd say that The first omen was an unsolicited yet a surprising installment to the franchise.

Kudos to performance of Nell Tiger Free who's the lead actor. What a cool name combination btw.",6.0,29 May 2024
"Slow, boring and stupid.","Wow, where to begin? When you name a movie, the first omen, it's hard not to compare it to the original film. That film understood pacing and tension. It understood that sometimes just a look from a creepy kid was scarier than most horror movies today. It created a sense of evil that permeated the entire film. What isn't scary is repeatedly showing a slimy hand of the devil with overly dramatic music.

This film is slow and boring. There is a very long scene with two nuns talking endlessly in a bedroom. It was agony to watch. The first half of this movie, doesn't feel like a horror film at all. It feels like a story about crazy nuns. When the plot does unfold, it is like watching The Usual Suspects after watching the ending first. I like the actress from Servant, but in this it feels like she is playing the same character. She doesn't quite know if she is good or evil. She has visions. She is confused. Who cares.

When they tie it to the Omen at the end, it feels cheap. It's embarrassing, and the sort of ""plot twist"" we all saw coming from the first act.",1.0,31 May 2024
Beautifully unsettling,"This movie was almost perfect, and many scenes still are. The only problem comes when it feels like it gets oddly disrupted. Let's take a look at some amazing pieces of film making, and the moments that almost got in the way.

There are moments that feel like this was filmed in the late 70's or early 90's. Wide camera shots with characters talking via voiceover. Loud and heavy score work that makes it feel like you are witnessing a religious experience but played at a tone that feels uncomfortable. Hell, the entire first scene feels like it was a remastered deleted scene from The Omen. Unfortunately, the entire film is not shot in this manner, and the many retro scenes get spliced with scenes filmed in a more modern style. It kind of pulls you out of the movie for a minute.

The atmosphere is heavy and eerie. A lot of this has to do with the musical score work, but it doesn't just end there. The camera work, the body language, the unsettling chants and whispers. All of these and more created an atmosphere that really pulled you in. Oddly enough, it was the more ""horrific"" scenes that pushed me out. It almost seemed to disturb the atmosphere for a shock moment. I'm not saying these more horrific scenes aren't necessary or good. Some of these scenes were amazing in their own right. I am just saying that they felt mildly off-beat with the scenes that surrounded them.

Probably the biggest issue I have with the movie is that it both changes the story established in the original The Omen, but also sometimes goes out of the way to push that this movie is a direct prequel to The Omen. I almost feel like it would have been better just to have it stand on its own because the movie is so amazing and it seems to cheapen it when they throw in a copy of a scene that occurred in The Omen or go out of there way to explain how this movie bridges to The Omen.

Overall, even through its faults, this was an amazing movie. I can think of multiple scenes that will stick with me forever. Not because they were horrific. But because they were beautifully unsettling. This movie does the best job at this sub-genre that I have seen in a very long time.",8.0,5 June 2024
"It is an Omen for a good movie, surprisingly","I saw ""The Omen"" that stared Gregory Pack. It was a long time ago, can't even remember when, but I liked it a lot. That is the reason why I didn't connect the dots between this movie and that old and one of the most influencing movies of the horror genre, that was created at one of horror's golden age.

Arkasha Stevenson, that directed some of ""Legion"" episodes is in charge of directing this movie and she does a hell of a job. She takes fine elements from classic horror movies, metaphors and signs to blend them into her movie and even gets the time to address matters like abortion and of course church vs. Non-religious people.

The way the church molds their flocks, that should run by fear is one of the biggest criticisms that this movie has to offer (maybe it was in the original movie, but...don't really remember any of it). It also has to offer a sublime acting performance buy Nell Tiger Free (which most of us maybe remember as Myrcella Baratheon).

This young woman, with this long and weird family name, just explodes on the screen with a fabulous acting performance. She's pious, terrified, happy, believing and confused. She can be even sexy, if needed and also demented. And towards the end she is also having a blast by taking her acting to the next level.

It is a prequel that holds impressively with the expectations that the original movie has built. The directing and acting are just amazing. The movie is not scary, and that's his weak spot, but I'm sure that if we will look now on the original, we won't be so frightened, as we seek to get.

It has its moments and they are well crafted by A skilled director, that is making her movie successful debut and makes it work on so many levels. One of the best horror films recently, though it feels so generic, it is distinguished from other due to the performance and especially the way of the director to separate it from others of the genre.",7.0,29 May 2024
Not scary and loooooonnnngggggg,"I went into this movie aware that it was a 'slow burn'. This is fine with me and I greatly enjoyed movies such as VVitch, The Invitation, The House of the Devil etc. However, a slow burn movie done well maintains the suspense / dread throughout to keep you invested. In this movie, scenes are just stretched out to twice as long as they need to be and (in my case at least) boredom set in. When I needed a bathroom break I even ended up browsing the boards for upcoming movies rather than return to my seat straight away - I have never done that before in a cinema. To top it off there are continuity issues between this movie and the original this is the prequel to, which irritates as the original is such a classic. Not scary, and not worthy of the Omen name.",1.0,29 April 2024
"""THE FIRST OMEN"" REVIEW","Directed by Arkasha Stevenson. A runtime of two hours. With an R rating.

""Margaret,"" played by Nell Tiger Free, is a young American headed to Rome to become a full-fledged nun. She was guided by ""Cardinal Lawrence,"" played by Bill Nighy.

Once in Rome, everything wasn't as ""Margaret"" expected. Her roommate ""Luz,"" played by Maria Caballero, is wild and getting the last bit of sin out of her. Then you have this little girl, ""Carlita,"" played by Nicole Sorace, who is unlike the rest of the little girls at the church.

She's also being treated poorly by ""Sister Silva,"" played by Sonia Braga, in ""Margaret's"" eyes. A lot of weird things are also happening surrounding ""Carlita."" This is a huge problem because ""Margaret"" as a child had a hard time recognizing what was real and what was made up in her head.

Things only get worse when she's approached by ""Father Brennan,"" played by Ralph Ineson. He tells her about a horrible conspiracy the church is pulling over everyone's eyes. They are plotting a huge plan surrounding ""Carlita"" and the incarnation of pure evil.

What is real and what is not? Is this plan serious? ""Margaret"" will have to figure it out before it's too late. In this eerie prequel to the 1976 horror cult classic ""The Omen,"".

""The First Omen"" cast the right person in Nell Tiger Free. SB (sidebar): I love her name, by the way. My first time noticing her was when I watched the AppleTV+ series, ""Servant."" Nell plays the innocent but is involved in some terrifying stuff character, all too well.

This film also had Bill Nighy in it. I just wrote about him. He's been booked and busy. Don't let your age be a deterrent, because he isn't.

When it comes to this film, I thought I was watching Sydney Sweeney's ""Immaculate."" It was pretty much copy-and-paste. The only difference is that they incorporated the language difference in ""Immaculate."" This film, they just ignored it pretty much.

It wasn't scary, and that's saying a lot coming from me. I was more confused than anything. Now I have to watch ""The Omen"" to get more context. It wasn't a bad film. I've seen bad horror films. This wasn't it.

It was like watching a different interpretation of ""Immaculate"" or seeing someone do the same script but with different directors. I feel about this like I feel about that film. It was cool. I think Sydney did an amazing job with that ending, but Nell Tiger Free had a better overall performance.

A decent film that's not that scary. I give it three more fires 🔥🔥🔥.

Prayin' Like it's 1976,"The First Omen could easily have arrived as a cynical cash grab (may well be that was the original intention) but, like last years Evil Dead Rise, it has clearly fallen into the hands of someone who loves and understands the original. That's not to say it isn't without issues.

This is a direct prequel to 1976 classic The Omen and focuses on how demonic hellspawn Damian came to be born. Obviously, there is only so much milage to be garnered from ""person has baby"" as a plot so a fair chunk of the story focuses on mystery. Margaret Diano (Nell Tiger Free) arrives in Rome to help at an orphanage as she prepares to take the veil. It quickly becomes apparent something spooky is afoot, especially since Father Brennan (Ralph Ineson) keeps accosting her in the street to warn her about a sinister church plot to bring forth the antichrist. The plot tries to get some milage out of exactly how they plan to do this but there isn't much to it and the ""twist"" is so obvious it's a strange decision to present it as one.

A good horror isn't about plot though, it's about atmosphere and The First Omen has it in spades. At $30 million it's fairly expensive for a film of this type but every penny is visible on screen and first time director (of films anyway) Arkasha Stevenson imbues the film with real style. The film is clearly made with a reverence for not just The Omen but all the horror classics of that era. Despite the methodical pace the movie doesn't skimp on frights either. There's scares of the creepy, unsettling kind, jumps and even some gruesome body horror and they're well paced, making sure there isn't time for the audience to ever get too comfortable.

The performances are also good. Free is a likeable lead, showing vulnerability but with enough steel that she never strays into wide-eyed faun territory. The other nuns are all well portrayed too, including authoritative Mother Superior (Sonia Braga), a suspicious true believer (Ishtar Currie-Wilson) and free spirited initiate (Maria Caballero). Bill Nighy is on hand as the priest in charge of the orphanage and there's even a small appearance by Charles Dance.

At two hours long it feels like there could have been a little fat trimmed off and clunky namedropping near then end is a bit cheesy but The First Omen is a classy horror movie that, takes its time yes, but delivers on atmosphere and spooks.

7 salacious jackals out of 10.",7.0,30 May 2024
Shocking Moments in Rome,"In the years from 1968 onwards, the major Hollywood studios were in transition. The usual large-scale productions no longer worked at the box office. Society was on the move, old certainties were dissolving. This is how films with a scary Antichrist theme became mainstream box office successes. ROSEMARIE's BABY (1968) from PARAMOUNT PICTURES, THE EXORCIST (1973) from WARNER BROTHERS and THE OMEN (1976) from TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX were shown successfully in cinemas worldwide and caused many a shocking moment.

TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX is now part of the DISNEY Group, and it makes sense to revive old successful models in a time of new confusion. While the devil Damien in THE OMEN had long since crawled into hiding with his foster parents (Gregory PECK and Lee REMICK), THE FIRST OMEN finally tells us what actually happened shortly before the birth of the jackal's son in the Holy City of Rome. Young Margaret (Nell Tiger FREE) comes to Rome from America to finally take her vows. But very strange things happen with the nuns around Sister Silva (Sonia BRAGA), which prompt Margaret to investigate. Something monstrous comes to light...

This history has it all. Just don't let yourself be fooled by the light-filled images from the city of Rome. Selected scenes pay homage to the three horror classics mentioned above from the heyday of the Antichrist cinema. Glass windows, clouds of fog (and in Rome!!!), black masses and body horror play a huge role. Ralph INESON and ACADEMY AWARD nominee Bill NIGHY (he was nominated for LIVING in 2023) can also be seen in other roles. The performances of Charles DANCE and Andrea ARCANGELI will be particularly remembered by the audience.

And the music can also be heard. In addition to the original sounds by Jerry GOLDSMITH, the canzones by Raffaella CARRA (DOMANI and RUMORE) provide a typically Italian flair.

The production by Arkasha STEVENSON is quite impressive. Sometimes the screen simply remains black for a moment, so that an appropriate film image is found for the nasty use of knockout drops.

Yes, this prequel to THE OMEN is extremely successful. Gregory PECK, who can be seen briefly in a photo, would certainly have been happy.",7.0,21 April 2024
Solid Prequel to a Classic,"This was a movie that when I saw was coming out, I was intrigued. I'm not the biggest fan of prequels, because they have a definite ending that they must do or it doesn't work. Ahead of seeing this, I saw people were loving it. I did sit on this before writing my review to make sure that I was being fair.

Synopsis: a young American woman is sent to Rome to begin her life of service to the church but meets a darkness that causes her to question her faith and uncovers a terrifying conspiracy that hopes to bring about the evil incarnate.

We start this with Father Harris (Charles Dance) meeting Father Brennan (Ralph Ineson). There is an ominous way of filming the opening that harkens back to the original. It appears that these two have uncovered a plot that involves a young woman named Scianna. Their information is limited though. We also see that there are dark forces trying to stop them.

That is when we shift over to meeting the woman from the synopsis, Margaret (Nell Tiger Free). She has come to Rome to become a nun at an orphanage. She is met by Father Gabriel (Tawfeek Barhom) who then takes her to Cardinal Lawrence (Bill Nighy). These two met when she was a child. He is the reason that she has come to Rome to take her vows. She looks at him as a father figure.

She arrives at the orphanage and is given a lay of the land by Sister Silva (Sonia Braga). It is during this tour that we see that this place also has a wing to help expecting mothers. During this tour that she meets an odd nun, Sister Anjelica (Ishtar Currie-Wilson). She also meets a young woman who is isolated, Carlita Scianna (Nicole Sorace). Margaret is staying in an apartment with Luz (Maria Caballero), before they both take their vows. It is off the orphanage grounds.

Something I should include here is that this takes place in the early 1970s. There is unrest in Rome as the younger generation is turning their backs on religion. They are also rioting. What is interesting is that this is based in fact. This makes Margaret uneasy. She also doesn't like the way that Carlita is treated by the sisters. Then to complicate her time further, Luz takes her out. She gets drunk, blacks out and doesn't remember what happened. Father Brennan also approaches her, wanting her to help him uncover the truth of the orphanage she is working at.

That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is that I'm a big fan of the original movie in the series. It is up there as one of the best religious based horror films in my opinion. The second one is a good follow up and I thought the third did interesting things. I don't even hate the fourth movie even though it was made for TV. It is just the remake that I feel doesn't hold up. This is information that I felt important before diving into this one.

Where I'll start then is continuity. I'm glad that this one doesn't do anything to violate what the original or the sequels did. It synced up well, which is what I'm looking for. In a group chat that I'm in, it might even tie into part four, but it's been a while since my last viewing of that one and I don't remember a lot. This shouldn't come as a spoiler, but I thought that this one did well to show how Damien was conceived and then ended up in the care of the Thorns.

I'll even credit this one as being creepy at times. I'm a sucker for religious based horror, especially when we're looking at the corruption of the church. That is what we're getting here. It is wild that this came out the same year as Immaculate as we're following similar stories. They just end up in different places. I'm not fully sure that the plan of our villain makes sense here. It could do what they want, but it also could spell the end of the world. I see the logic being that as they're so convinced that no matter what, good will triumph. Just seems a dangerous move to play. It also lessens what the movies that follow and their story concept. I will still say that this does give a solid atmosphere. Messing with Margert, who has a history of mental illness. We can see that logically; she could be misinterpreting things. I like playing with this idea.

Now I've seen people rating this high and heaping praise. I can't do that though. My biggest issue is that this borrows from other movies that do it better. This directly takes the shocking moments from The Omen and uses them here. I can't credit this movie for that. I get the idea that this is banking on younger audiences not having seen that. There is also a big plot point that is from Rosemary's Baby which is one of my favorite movies of all time. It also takes its most shocking moment from Possession.

Since I went hard there, let me go over to filmmaking. I still think is well-made. The cinematography was good. I like how they frame things, even if they're nodding to the original. Setting up this where we have Margaret who is a fish out of water is good. She doesn't speak the language so that's scary. On top of that, she has the history of mental illness. I like how we don't know if we can trust her. I think that the effects for the most part are good. It looked like they went practically where they could. There was CGI used which was fine as well. Other than that, I was bummed that we didn't use more of the chanting or choir style music from the original. It does at a pivotal point that worked though. The sound design was good though.

All that is left is acting. I thought that Free was good as our lead. She can balance that maybe she isn't crazy, but we have history and facts that contradict that. I also thought she showed good fear. It doesn't help that she is taking on the higher ups at this orphanage, when she is new which is stressful too. Ineson is solid as our priest who is out to prove what is happening. His performance matches up with that character from the original from what I remember. Braga is good as our head nun. We should trust her, but we don't know if we can. I like Barhom and Caballero in their roles. What I like there is that as things go on, we don't know who we can trust. I'd also say that Dance, Nighy, Sorace, Currie-Wilson, Andrea Arcangeli and the rest of the cast worked for what was needed.

In conclusion, I thought this was a solid prequel. My issue with movies like this is more that they tend to feel predictable to me. What they do here story wise is good. It fills in what we know from the original. It also incorporates elements from the sequels. The acting was good across the board. This was made well enough. The biggest issue that I have is that it borrows major scenes from other movies that I personally think did it better, including the first movie in this franchise. Another gripe is that this runs too long. Getting it down to at least one hour and forty-minute minutes, but preferably 90 minutes would help. I'd still recommend giving it a viewing, especially if you like the series.

My Rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,22 April 2024
Surprisingly good prequel!,The movie definitely exceeded my expectations. I went to see it in theaters with my husband and was so glad we did. It has a decent amount of jump scares but doesn't overdo it. I got slightly confused nearing the end of the movie but the plot became clearer as it furthered along (maybe I'm just slow). I also really enjoyed the acting and I'm all for gore! The score is creepy as hell and the scenery is beautiful. Although I do LOVE the original Omen from the 70's I'd be very interested in another remake from this Director and writing team. I believe that this movie overall was very well made and I really enjoyed watching it.,8.0,5 June 2024
An effective prequel!,"The movie faithfully follows (pun intended) the trajectory of 'Nunsploitation', a new 'trend' in the horror realm which has been gaining momentum for quite some time now.

It particularly brought to mind Michael Mohan's recent directorial ""Immaculate"", which I had the opportunity to watch and review just a month ago.

Both films share similar themes and treatments, with the main difference being that this one is part of a well-established franchise.

As a result, it not only had to work on its own as a standalone feature but also had this daunting task of serving as a 'prequel' to the first entry released way back in 1976.

And I must admit, it succeeded on both grounds.

The movie boasts solid writing, aided by a tight screenplay and impressive technical expertise, helped to set the mood and tone effortlessly.

My only complaint is that the supporting cast does not offer much, at least from a writing perspective. The burden of storytelling falls heavily on the shoulders of the protagonist, Margaret (played commendably by Nell)

With a bit more emphasis put on developing the supporting characters, it could have become something truly special, something worth remembering.",7.0,3 June 2024
So bad I'm mad at it,"Went to the theater today and was expecting a good creepy ick. Well not this time, sister. The first half was trying to build up a story by switching from obvious foreshadowing and bits of history. The history went nowhere and the foreshadowing didn't either. Ok so the second half was just a monkey throwing poo at a script. Really, it's as if the writers were brainstorming scenes for the movie and then said well let's just film some of those and stick them in the movie...nobody will notice there's no story or reason for them to be happening. This was the biggest pile of empty movie carcasses to hit the screen since Cats. Rotted.",2.0,6 April 2024
by FAR the best horror movie I have seen in YEARS,"This is a truly brilliant, genre-bending piece of cinema. We have all been scarred by the countless poorly done remakes and sequels Hollywood has churned out over the years, but The First Omen is absolutely not part of that camp. It could honestly standalone as a fantastic horror film independent of it's parent-franchise.

If you are a fan of stunning cinematography, incredible acting and truly terrifying stories, then you NEED to see this movie.

Nell Tiger Free is absolutely incredible as the film's protagonist, and she deserves to be a huge star after this movie. She has got such star quality and likability and will honestly break your heart in some of the more harrowing scenes.

The supporting cast are also excellent. A must see movie!",10.0,5 April 2024
"The Omen prequel that's great, for the most part. [+68%]","Two nun-horror films were released a couple of weeks apart, with more or less the same plot structure. Is this a case of a one-line idea (co-incidentally) navigating the minds of several screenwriters or straight-up idea theft? We'll never know. I'm reminded of a storyline theft issue in the Malayalam industry earlier in May that made headlines. On the bright side, at least Hollywood seems chill about it (or are they?). If it's pure coincidence, then color me intrigued. Because, Immaculate and The First Omen follow the same ""plot structure"" (not plot). Michael Mohan's film had its merits and flaws, and that's the case with Arkasha Stevenson's too.

The First Omen is a better-looking film visually. It probably has a lot to do with Arkasha getting to work with a $30 mn budget as opposed to Mohan's $9 mn. This is evident from the very first scene - a heady reminder that it's a prequel to one of the most iconic horror movies of all time. Nell Tiger Free's got an incredibly expressive face, and that's a definite tickmark for a horror film protagonist. Novitiate Margaret arrives at an orphanage for girls in Rome, as clueless and excited as anyone that age would be. There are early signs of things going awry, but director Arkasha saves the most startling stuff for the film's second act.

That's also when it proudly bears its ""prequel to The Omen"" stamp, treating us to ghastly imagery (for sure, will stay in your head for a fairly long time). The film, by nature, has a lot to do with female body horror; therefore, the way the makers execute a particularly disturbing birth scene is worthy of applause. I completely enjoyed some of Arkasha's shot choices, and it's exactly the lighting, the camera positioning, the color palette, and the quick cuts that make it a thrillingly engaging ride (for the most part). The gothic-styled costumes were also an add-on. On the flip side, I didn't find the climax (and the epilogue) all that impressive (which is where Immaculate scored better IMO). It was honestly a writing (and not a performative) mess, until.. until.. until that Damien name-drop. I'd watch a sequel if Free and Arkasha return as the lead and the director, respectively.",7.0,31 May 2024
Completely Unnecessary Film,"This, although I'm sure, was well intentioned it was completely unneeded to the lore of the first film and book. There was plenty of ways to create a ""prequel"" without genuinely ruining the story that follows it. I'm not sure if it the 'short attention span' that modern film goers require that caused this story to be filmed as it was. There is a reason the original story and movie are listed as thrillers and not just flat out horror films but this missed the label by being some sort of splatter gore film.

It's sad that the classic original story won't be near as impressive to someone seeing it the first time if they've watched 'The First Omen' before it.",4.0,2 June 2024
A well deserved addition to the franchise...!!!,,7.0,29 May 2024
Continuity Continuity Continuity...,"How can I say anything about the continuity in The First Omen without including any spoilers? Well here goes...

The very concept of a prequel relies on the original that it's meant to precede. So how come this one makes such a massive error? An error that's so big you have to question whether the writers had even seen the original.

I'm not going to give details since this would definitely qualify as a spoiler but I'll explain why I've still given it 7/10. It's simply because if this was a stand-alone film then I would've rated it even higher since there's little else I would criticize aside from continuity.

Unfortunately it's not a stand-alone film and for this very reason I re-watched the 1976 original beforehand to get me in the mood. This prompted a lot of speculation regarding what could be included in this prequel. No spoilers here.

There are several key narrative constructs in the original that I would've liked to have seen developed. Some of these can be overlooked but there's a big one that's omission is inexcusable. (If you have to know then there's plenty of reviews, with spoilers, that will feed your curiosity.)

Despite the divided opinions relating to the prequels Rogue One and The Thing (2011) I was very impressed by the continuity in both. Sadly this is where The First Omen fails, ultimately amounting to an unfortunate missed opportunity.",7.0,19 April 2024
Thin fare for diehard Satanists,"After a gory opening with a two-minute cameo from Charles Dance, the movie slips into a low gear for half-an-hour or more before the Revelations start to kick in to make it an over-ripe prelude to the OMEN originals. Bill Nighy looks very uncomfortable in his role as a cardinal who may or may not be fully protective of our heroine; in one early scene I thought his lines were being dubbed, God knows why.

There's a garish glamour to the whole show that calls Dario Argento to mind. There are some welcome nods to the Gregory Peck OMEN, but the link to that movie at the end of this one is clumsy and seems to leave open the possibility that THE FIRST OMEN will not be the Last Omen. A prequel with a sequel - not sure that's a good idea. Sadly, Bill Nighy does not bring anything like the degree of class that Gregory Peck brought to the first Damien story in 1976. For diehard fans of Satanic-themed movies (count me in!) this is rather thin fare.",6.0,11 April 2024
"Almost, but only almost. Hm, probably the female factor.","An amazing look, it looks like it's from the times when such films originally belonged, the wild 70s. Well, that style soon turns out to be a simple sepia filter, but still. The omens were generally rather modest, another franchise being exploited. There are rather poor role models for such commercially orientated projects, especially in recent years. But the makers dared to go down a classic path, not only visually, but also in terms of staging, and were well rewarded by the general criticism of the film, which was positive. However, the consumer is the decisive factor and the expected money was not made at the cinema box office. The Omen is not a pure shocker, more of a mystical slow burner with a few nasty spikes. Courageous, because this is now only partially in line with the horror-affine part of the audience, even the trailers nowadays have to promise gruesome, permanent terror or brutal splatter. The script is interesting, a really good idea for a prequel. With all the agenda, eccentric Judaism or unbearable Islam, the film once again provides a good reminder of how strange many things are in Christianity too. I was well entertained, but I don't see the need for a re-watch, there is simply a lack of iconic sequences.",6.0,2 June 2024
Such a surprise,,8.0,8 June 2024
"A standard movie with decent visuals, though not outstanding.","The scariest movie of 2024? No, that's absolutely far off the mark. 'The First Omen' isn't the scariest movie of the year, but it offers nice twists and turns, anticipation, and suspense. The storyline is engaging, although there are similar movies with comparable themes. Despite that, it remains watchable and interesting. The performances, especially by the lead actors, bring depth to the characters, and the atmospheric soundtrack enhances the eerie mood. The cinematography captures the dark, foreboding ambiance effectively. Overall, it's an intriguing prequel that leaves us curious about what Damien has to offer the world next.",6.0,8 June 2024
Diabolical!,"Another absolutely awful rehash of a classic that actually has the nerve to change a key element from the original story and then try and tie it in to the events leading up to the first film. That indicates that they don't even care what fans of The Omen think and are just going for a younger audience. As for the film itself, it's the usual fish out of water horror set up with a naive American trainee nun sent to a shadowy convent in seventies Rome to take her vows. It's all very obvious stuff and is strikingly similar to the other recent and slightly less bad horror Immaculate except this one has more tired jump scares and awful cgi gore. The performances are tepid given the terrible material but particularly bad is Bill Nighy who seems to have wandered off the set of comedy. Stick with the original or even part 3 or 4 which are masterpieces compared to this tripe.",1.0,21 April 2024
A prequel to a film that's almost 50 years old but still manages to pull it off in hard hitting way.,"One of the very few horror films that's ever made me go ""This is cinema."" quite a few times. We don't see horror cinema with such pleasing aesthetics, impeccable acting and beautiful writing these days. Arkasha Stevenson crafts an absolute classic and what is, in my view the best prequel to any IP horror film. This is what happens when studios truly respect the filmmaker's vision and let them cook and care for their fans.

I wouldn't call this film to be scary but it's more of an unsettling origin story to a nightmare that came out nearly 50 years ago yet commands praise and glory with this take on the birth of the 'Son of the devil'. It didn't need to hit this hard but we're here for it. Now, let's give Arkasha Stevenson more horror films and place her among the elite of the new gen horror filmmakers. She's an absolute showstopper and a rock star. This is best thing to have happened to the Omen franchise since its inception.",9.0,5 April 2024
good style to a non-interesting story,"I never liked original Omen story as well. It is boring and not scary. A kid causing terrible things around, it was all about and the original Omen story was just like that, someone falls from ladder and then we see a closeup of the kid's face, so what, everyday people fall from ladders :) Anyways, this movie cinematographically fine, director done his best and done the max that could be done with this simple silly story.

Overall, not scary, more mystery and thriller type, no intention to scare the viewer as well. Also, in terms of horror genre, there is nothing new in terms of element.

I read the reviews a lot before watching, everyone was hyping about the birth scene etc, there is nothing scary about the birth scene, for god's sake. We saw much more scary gory scenes in other movies.

In short, dull story, nothing new about horror genre, not scary, perfect PR job, and people who have no idea about horror movies will like it.",6.0,28 May 2024
This should not have been allowed use the name name the omen in the title,"Religious horror movies don't need gore or jump scares - they need to have suggestive, sinister plots that you can't really rationalize. This movie has nothing.... not an iota of anything even remotely unsettling or clever or sinister. It's so bad... despite as fairly decent cast it fails miserably. There are entire scenes and dialogues that are just pointless.

There is another movie, same movie different production company, way better.. released 2024 called Immaculate watch this one instead. The First Omen is a shambles of a movie and that's being generous!

It's a pity because it had so much potential. Story wise.",1.0,30 May 2024
What if evil is a real part of our life?,"It's difficult to make your own film when it has to be the prequel to one of the most iconic horror pictures. Yet this effort, while seemingly all over the place, and having to retread the major tropes of the franchise, comes together as the run-time agglomerates on, resulting in the most profound expression of the Catholic Church's sex scandals that I've seen thus far in cinema.

That said, it's not much more of an exceptional film than on those terms. There's some time relishing the period piece mis-en-scene in Act I, and as with major motion pictures in general nowadays there's a high bar for quality photography, and indeed there are even some great shots (c.f. Any setup with a mirror, or the noir tight angle of the lead character walking toward the camera in a dark alley). But the horror is all almost comically overdone, relying on jump scares, most of all loud sudden noises, and trying to depict demons at times via practical effects and at other times more CGI, but always running into the same issue that was present in Night of the Demon: we can't suspend our disbelief at a representation of something so alien to our lived experiences, so the monster is met with incredulity--on the other hand, the evil that humans actually inflict on each other, as depicted as well as hinted at/allegorized, is movingly impactful.

I'm in general a fan of satanic possession/incarnation movies, as they get us to think about moral philosophy in the entertaining imaginative spaces of the horror genre and the superstitions of religions we're supposed to have shed. The Omen is as much of a lodestone as The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby in that regard; and while I don't quite have the same response to this prequel as I did to the remake of The Omen--a fine movie, but simply a modern production of the original, and therefore why did that money need to be spent, and that time diverted?--there is the question of why The First Omen needs to wallow in modern horror trappings, rather than totally focus on the actually compelling themes--first of all, the matter of being gaslit over evil that has traumatized you; and also, more secondarily, the political climate of the '70s (especially Italy), as secularism takes over cultural hegemony from religion (thereby threatening the relevance of long-time ways of doing and thinking about things).

(One more note: the noir diversions with the priest who introduces us to this picture, while certainly an entertaining convention that we're all accustomed to in this subgenre of devil cinema, feel superfluously sewn on--""characters"" reading lines we know too well by now.)",6.0,6 April 2024
Unique story,"I just got back from The First Omen. But I did found the story the story very interesting. I think it's a bit like Midsummer in terms of shock factor. I didn't found it that scary it's more shock factor than scary. Some scenes were very impressive and a bit unsettling. Unfortunately found the story a bit confusing. If I were to see this film again for the first time, I would first look up some information so that I understand it from the beginning. I also recommend that people do this unless you absolutely don't want any spoilers. It was certainly a unique story. Not your typical supernatural horror films.

Mostly predictable...but still enjoyed it,"I just finished watching The First Omen earlier tonight. I was able to predict almost everything that was going to happen. It definitely seemed like they were following a formula. However, even though I knew most of the story ahead of time, I still enjoyed watching it. The actors did a good job and there were some genuine creepy moments. I was surprised by the lack of subtitles at first. However, I think that is because we are meant to be as confused as the main character. Also, I wonder if they pulled the same trick as The Thing, where everything said in a different language was actually giving the plot away. Also, while you do not need to have watched The Omen, it will help with noticing the various Easter eggs hidden throughout the film.",7.0,13 April 2024
The First Omen is something special.,"This was one of those films for which my expectations were on the floor; the marketing was somewhat muted, the review embargo lifted the day before and above all, the first film wasn't great and what came afterwards were worse. The first film from 1978 received mixed reviews that I believe were fair; the movie was flawed from script to acting to pacing. Then came along this film, it was stunning, the cinematography was inventive, the jumpscares were scarce but the eeriness and uneasiness were high. The central performances were nuanced and perfect. If I didn't know any better, I would've thought this was an A24 horror film, but it's 21stCentury! That's the highest praise I can heap on this pic.

The story was so boring that I found myself thinking back to ""Sharks on the Moon"" as a better movie than this and that was a bad movie.

The most interesting part of this movie was listening to the conversations of the other people watching this.

"""Damien.""","In all honesty just by how much praise I had heard for this I was expecting a much scarier film, and while I do think it had some really atmospheric scenes and I did get freaked out on numerous occasions, I just don't think it was really all that scary. However; I did have this feeling of dread and unease practically from start to finish so I believe that's a plus for it. Although if we're talking the scariest part of the entire thing by far has to have been the sudden pregnancy thing, which was genuinely horrific and insanely well acted, but also felt really goofy at times due to the absurdity of the way she moved and such.

From director Arkasha Stevenson who also helped direct the hit show Brand New Cherry Flavor, comes a prequel to the classic horror film from 1976, showcasing how the child in that film, the antichrist known as Damien was born into this world and able to wreak havoc. I personally have never actually seen the original omen film, nor the remake from 2006, but if they're anything like this I can absolutely see why they were solidified as a classic in the horror genre, and are remembered today. I mean I've kind of always known of Damien for some reason, and I couldn't even begin to say where I had heard it from, but that's just such an iconic piece of work that I've just always known it off the top of my head.

Despite not having the background on this franchise as a whole other than an immensely surface level understanding of it, I still found this to be at the very least, enjoyable. I'm not going to be saying it's the scariest movie I've seen in a while as I really didn't find it all that scary for the large duration of its runtime, although one jumpscare quite literally made me jump straight out of my theater chair next to my mother and that was very surprising for me. But the actual scariness of it all doesn't come from anything jumpscare like or even all that body horror esque, mainly just the vibe of uncomfortableness that is radiating through the thing from start to finish, which had my leg shaking like crazy because I was on edge the entire time - which I will say is a good thing because not many horror movies tend to freak me out that much. Yet that's really the main plus of it all, is just the atmosphere it provides, as to be frank the rest of it didn't really hit for me that much, even if I can see why some people would love it, it just didn't really resonate with me.

By a long shot the best part of this movie has to be the exceptional acting from the lead, actress Nell Tiger Free as Margaret, a woman of faith with a deeply troubled past that hides some very dark secrets within. It is very easy to say that without her as the lead here it would've been nowhere near as good, as she is excellent at playing true terror and the sheer amount of breakdowns and freak outs she has are astonishing and so well done that the viewer can't help but feel queasy during them, plus the scene I mentioned earlier would've been horrid without her, because even with her it does get a tad goofy the longer it goes on. I am very much so looking forward to seeing this girl in more roles, especially horror, as she has a clear knack for this type of stuff and I can absolutely see her being one of the greatest horror actresses of the new generation.

Anyone who knows me knows that I am a sucker for blood and gore and just overall practical effects in my horror movies, and since this one was rated r that's kind of what I was expecting going in, but to my surprise and somewhat disappointment in a way, the only amount of visually displayed gore we get is in the stellar cold open, and at about the halfway point. I don't think it makes the movie bad for not explicitly showing it's kills as much as it could, but the fact that when it does show them they look fantastic does make me a bit disappointed, as it would've been amazing to be able to see them as they were occuring. Bravo to the makeup department here, as there is one charred ass body that looks so well made and I was floored whenever it appeared on screen.

I would not consider this to be my favorite horror movie, and especially not of the year 2024 - hot take: I think immaculate was a more enjoyable time - however; I can wholeheartedly commend the excellency that went into creating this thing, and it is without a doubt easily one of the better horror prequels I have seen. Some really well done acting that feels incredibly realistic ninety nine percent of the time and left me feeling superbly on edge and unsettled for almost the entirety of its two hour long run time, and some really good practical effects that while scarce, look stunning and are a reason to watch this by themselves. One cool ass creature design, and one very in your face vagina.

I think it's worth checking out for yourself, but don't expect it to be blowing your socks off by any means. It definitely seems to be doing that for some people, but I'll be surprised if the large majority are going to feel the same way, as even though it is a very good movie I just don't think it's spectacular by any means. Sometimes horrifying, but also sometimes really goofy, a mixed bag that leans more towards being good than it does anything else. So if you're looking for a new religious horror film to watch in theaters I do think this is the one more suited for an audience as compared to Immaculate, even if personally I enjoyed that one a tad more. Plus this one has Ralph Ineson who is stupendous, and who I just saw absolutely kill it in Lord of Misrule.",7.0,15 April 2024
The Mother Of Damien Was a Jackel...,"Why...? Is the question I kept asking myself while watching this movie & I stopped watcihng it 40 minutes into the film.

I mean, I could go into all the reasons why this film is so terrible but just I'll save all that & just say watch the origanl Omen and you'll know excatly why this film is so bad -

The original Omen has an actual story that's tied to an intriguing plot with great charcters - all the elements that make good storytelling - this film has non.

It is obvious to me the peple that made this film really don't care about what they do & they just produce content instead of movie that's why this contect will be forgoten in six months time while the original Omen still stands strong today.",1.0,28 May 2024
Somewhere in the middle,"This movie is neither good nor bad. Has a terrific start and first 45 minutes, then a classic and boring 30 minutes and ""why is this not ending already?!?!"" 30 more minutes.

Acting is good (except the guest star Father Brennan) but it doesn't really save the movie level. A lot of scenes are good when you first see it but takes too long (best examples are most scenes close to the end where instead of 30 seconds, movie spends 4 minutes every scene)

It connects good enough to the original movie Omen but it really could pass as an independent movie too

Overall, a movie that worths your time only if you really have time and horror movies are your hobbies.",6.0,22 April 2024
The First Omen,"Margaret, a young novice played by Nell Tiger Free goes to Rome to take her final vows in a convent that runs an orphanage. There she is welcomed by her old friend and mentor Cardinal Bill Nighy, the other nuns and roommate Luz who persuades her to enjoy life once more time before taking her vows. Initially content, she is though troubled that one girl in particular is treated severely and she finds strange things start to occur at the convent including a very unpleasant suicide. One day a priest approaches her with a bizarre story and ask for her help.

Rather impressive prequel to the seventies horror classic 'The Omen'. The film is finely paced with a strong sense of dread and horror aligned nicely with the tone of the original - this really sits well as a prequel. Like the film that followed this, there are a number of juicy deaths punctuating the sense of impending horror, but the real strength and what makes this in places an unnerving watch are the scenes of births and the presence of the devil which seem frighteningly real. Much much better than I was expecting with imaginative photography and a fine score - well worth catching.",6.0,31 May 2024
Decent Prequel of Blasphemy and Insanity,"The First Omen

Nearly 50 years after The Omen was released in theaters, a prequel, The First Omen, has now made its appearance. The Omen concentrated on Damien after his birth, and throughout his younger years. The First Omen, however, showed how his birth came to be.

If you would have called this movie Sacrilege: First Blood, or Blasphemy: Insanity's Revenge, they both would have worked. I absolutely love Catholic mythology movies, and, having seen the 1976 film, a prequel sounded fun. I've written several short essays about the different ways filmmakers interpret these myths, whether demonology, or science fiction, or superstition. This time, The First Omen focuses on extreme blasphemy and insanity.

What makes the move difficult to follow, at first, is the fact that two of the main characters have suffered from delusions, hallucinations and voices in their heads that they weren't sure were real. Therefore, any crazy happenings could be shooed away as mental illness. However, what is not a delusion, is the historical fact that the Catholic Church was no longer the primary force of rule in Europe.

The movie shows the riots that were happening in Rome in 1971, similar to the other riots across the globe where the younger generation is rebelling against authority. What bigger authority was there than the church? So what makes the most sense? Let's birth the anti-christ, but just a teeny tiny bit so it doesn't get out of control. Once the world learns of this, they'll return to the church out of fear. Doesn't this make perfect sense? I totally get the church being concerned about losing followers, but this is crazy.

This is not to say the movie was bad. The premise / motivation does make some sense, but then the execution wasn't too great. If the anti christ is born as a human, then a father is needed, and it's never really explained what, how, who that comes to be. This goes back to what I said about delusion or hallucinations as it could be anything.

The end of the movie leads directly into the original 1976 film which was a nice touch. You don't have to see that film to understand The First Omen, but it did help tie it together at the end. One last thing, though, is they left it open to a sequel that would run parallel to The Omen. I'm interested to see if they do one.",7.0,10 April 2024
What Walt's Watching,"Damien's back!

""The First Omen"" opens ominously with a nod to 70's cinema, but unfortunately there is not much horror in the first half of this film.

First time movie director Arkasha Stevenson needs to learn feature films are a game of 2 halves.

They try to deliver a thrilling mashup of horror tropes to give a classic story new life by focusing on the days before ""Damien"".

In ""The First Omen"" a young woman travels to Rome to become a Bride of Christ and in the process of some sleuth work discovers diabolical evil lurks in the church as she uncovers a terrifying conspiracy.

I guess if you haven't had your fill of nuns on the run after watching ""Immaculate"" (with a very similar storyline) then this might quench your hunger for big screen horror.

Personally it's all been done before and much better...even by the ""Hammer Horror"" genre.

Warning: MA rating in Australia and R stateside because of disturbing images and graphic nudity...apparently!

Nell Tiger Free (""Servant"" on Apple +) is brilliant as ""Margaret"" the nun in training with a distressful back story and she's supported by Ralph Ineson, Charles Dance & Bill Nighy as Fathers and Cardinal respectively.

""The First Omen"" is part of horror renaissance at the movies in 2024 with so many sinister, eerie, blockbuster books-fests to add to your watch list of coming attractions.

The film closes with a cool link to the OG movie, ""The Omen"".

A horror franchise that began in 1976 with the late great Gregory Peck, but it's not enough to save this version of prequel events from mediocrity.

Tim Smith's, Stevenson's and Keith Thomas's weak screenplay has a lot to answer for when you had the good bones of David Seltzer's original characters and Ben Jacoby's story to work from.",6.0,5 April 2024
Fantastic Prequel,"A little slow to start but once it takes off it's great. Awesome tension, good atmosphere and some legitimately frightening moments. Really hope they're planning a sequel prequel. I feel there is a lot of story left to go with here in between the end of this and the original movie. I feel like they payed nice homage to the original while also presenting a new and unique story. Nell Tiger Free is brilliant and elevates the whole movie with her performance (how have I not heard of her before). Great directorial debut for Arkasha Stevenson. Hope we see more from both of them in the horror genre.

Possibly overshadowed by Immaculate but still a fun time,"The second movie I've seen in a month that's about birthing the antichrist and I think that's what brings this down slightly as it's hot on the heels of Immaculate which was received really well by most folks.

I must say there are some disturbing and wild images in here, the story overall is creepy and takes some twists and turns before a frantic finale that had me screaming at the screen. It creeps me out that this sort of stuff could possibly happen within the church, I'm not talking about jackals and stuff but the theories of bringing about the antichrist to make people seek protection from the church once more is so crazy to me and makes this story even more gripping.

There are some wild shots in here that were awesome, lot's of spooky moments but none that really break the mold for horrors going forward but I still thought the overall performances across the board were great especially by Nell Tiger Free.

Some really great horrors recently, do I think this is the best so far? Hmmm, I don't think so. But it's a mighty good one!",7.0,6 April 2024
Way too slow of a burn,,3.0,1 June 2024
I personally thought it was great.,"I had to leave a review because i'm a bit incredulous this thing is only rated 6.6. This is a unique horror film that doesn't rely on jump scares (although there a couple of those), but rather atmosphere and pacing to generate scary. It reminded me of Rosemary's Baby, in that regard. Frankly, i don't remember the last time i felt 'scared' in a movie in this way... probably all the back to the Silence of the Lambs film when Clarice enters Buffalo Bill's house with night vision goggles. The direction is very novel, and dare i say, gutsy. Arkasha Stevenson is not afraid to cut to black, and leave it on black for dramatic effect, and the audience is terrified to see whats going to emerge from that blackness (and something always does). There are visual sequences of nearly montage, with eerie sound, that the viewer is forced to just experience their own subconscious of what their own person view of the Devil is. The James Wan horror style has taken over Hollywood, but i greatly prefer someone doing something their own way, like here. And i can not say enough about the lead actress. She gave her all for this role. Towards the end, and you'll know what scene i'm talking about, her performance border on horror and the absurd, the perfect blend, and creates an all-time cult classic moment on film. Well done.",9.0,10 June 2024
Surprisingly good prequel.,"""Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?"" Shakespeare's Hamlet to Ophelia.

I know, I know: I used the same quote a few weeks ago to begin my review of Immaculate, a scare fest about novitiate Cecilia (Sydney Sweeney) traveling to Italy to become a nun and serve the aging nuns for whom the convent exists. It's the same setup in The First Omen for Margaret (Nell Tiger Free), who's going to Rome in 1971 to take the veil and help orphans. Both stories are energized by the Catholic Church's obsession with virgin birth.

With encouragement from her mentor, Cardinal Lawrence (Bill Nighy, a man who can handily play good or evil because of his snarky smile and ambiguous whimsy), Margaret arrives with great joy from the elderly nuns, just as Cecilia did. I am ambivalent about nuns given my eight years under their thumbs in grammar school, for filmmakers seem also to love the possibilities of good and evil represented by their black and white uniforms. Sonia Braga is especially scary as Sister Silva.

First-time director Arkasha Stevenson pays homage to the Richard Donner 1976 horror classic, especially heroic for Stevenson since the original has become revered. The First Omen embraces a new take on the Antichrist by claiming its birth will bring back the faithful out of fear:

Father Brennan: (from trailer) ""How do you control people who no longer believe? You create something to fear.""

It also enjoys even more body horror than the original, often to the exclusion of coherent plotting. While it is faithful to the chaotic demonstrations and riots of the time in Rome, The First Omen does miss Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score.

Margaret begins to feel the presence of the demon, who is destined to use a young woman to come into the world just as Christ the Savior did through Immaculate Mary. Although we can expect the arrival of Antichrist Damien, the devil of the original Omen starring Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, right now Margaret must fight the sins of the flesh even before she confronts the arrival of Damien.

She does have a go at a disco, dressed to kill, so to speak, the night before taking her vows. That fling will have import, just as Catholic doctrine promised when we fall into sin. The rest of the film is formula for jump-scare horror flicks because like Nazis, these good-looking religious are waiting to show their true colors, not healthy in any scary film.

Although no new cinematic ground is dug up here, its special effects are impressive mainly in the workups for births. What remains is the usual nun/Catholic horror porn with lots of blood, ugly evil ones, and unholy nuns and priests. In this version, not as in Immaculate, the priests are sometimes good guys, while the nuns are uniformly homely and malevolent.",,10 April 2024
Intersting but it seems fitting.,"I had no knowledge of a prequel to the Omen Trilogy. It's been putting on and off. Partly due to the Pandemic. Yes, there was speculation of what's it going to be about. Anyway, since I've been a fan as a kid.

Now, after years since the three Films (1976-1981) and those nonsense AWAKENING and that silly remake back in 2006. It seems that the OMEN franchise still resonates with us.

This new film prequel THE FIRST OMEN directed by Arkasha Stevenson, her directorial debut, is an interesting offering. A few characters from the first film, to completely tell a new story of the birth of the Antichrist. The performances were well enough. Some elements from the first film are there too.

A young American nun comes to Rome and encounters an unusual evil while catering to the school for children. She becomes suspicious of supernatural occurrences around her. I don't want to give any spoilers here. I am so accustomed to the original plot created by David Seltzer. I have a few issues and questions about why they took the story to an extent and revised it.

Remember that is a classic horror story, that had the fans excited. There's lots of blood and gore to go around. It's a fair horror story that connects with the original 1976 film directed by the late Richard Donner.

I was hoping to more focus on the original story. The soundtrack was good with a holy choir with resurrecting the classic theme by Jerry Goldsmith. But I must say that it's better than THE EXCORCIST: BELIEVER. Entertaining and it flows confusedly throughout. It's fair but I will watch it again.

My rating: 7.0.",7.0,6 April 2024

Project Scianna!,"American novitiate Margaret Diano visits Rome in 1971, awaiting her vows.

Carlita is ill-treated by the nuns and Margaret forms a bond with her. When Father Brennan warns Margaret about Carlita's past and asks her support, Margaret is reluctant but the circumstances lead her to dig through Carlita's past. What does she find about Carlita and further the secrets she uncovers, opens her eyes.

It took nearly 46 years to finally come up with a worthy addition to the franchise and it just happened to be the prequel. The CBFC did seem to cut the scenes so despite getting to watch the less gory version, The First Omen definitely worked for me. The main reveal is largely predictable but the proceedings kept me hooked and debut director Arkasha Stevenson does a terrific job. Not relying too much on the jump scares, the film delivers thanks to Nell Tiger Free's performance especially in pre-climax. The First Omen is old-school horror film and it perfectly captures the tone of the 1976 version.",7.0,5 April 2024
Honestly Surprised,"This movie was quiet good. I had low expectations as prequels/sequels tend to miss the mark, but I thought the body horror was very well done and the acting was fantastic from the cast.

It did feel a little disjointed here and there, but no movie is without flaw. The plot/story was good but it could have been better. However, overall it was a good movie and makes for a great late night horror pick.

If you like creepy, uneasy horror, this one is for you.

Familiar Trope But Fresh,"Without spoiling too much, this is definitely one of these films were you can predict what's going to happen early on. But what makes this so fresh is the unique storytelling.

The First Omen is one of the most creepiest films ever made. Not because of jump scares. Not because of grotestque imagery. But simply because its realistic portrayals about supernatural events. As ridiculous as the characters' motivations are, the film is so well done that you believe them And it touches on some important modern issues.

The cinematography is outstanding and actually improves the creepiness of the story. The performances are great too.

One of the criticism I have is about the ending of the film. All the other elements of the film don't scream ""franchise film"". But the ending is a bit corny. If you know, you know.

Very Christian and Overly Ornamental,"Because of your faith, Christian, Catholic, etc. It may be easy to follow for those familiar with internal autocratic divisions. But it is interesting if such a process actually exists. I don't understand why representations of Satan are shown as a monster. After all, he is the same as other angels. When the bond of faith is over-exposed in movies, people of other religions directly try to dominate the progress. Although the film is boring in this context, it manages to keep the audience on the screen. It makes the audience more attracted to the follow-up and research in fiction. The incident was attributed to the ritual that took place at the back doors, rather than the worldly process of bringing the baby to the world. It looks like there will be a progression towards the Constantine movie. For the second scenario of the movie, war and struggle at the level of angels may appear.",6.0,2 June 2024

A Spellbinding Blend of Mystery and Mysticism ✨🔮,"""The First Omen,"" Arkasha Stevenson's highly anticipated supernatural thriller, weaves an intricate tapestry of mystery, mysticism, and edge-of-your-seat suspense. Set against the backdrop of a quaint New England town, the film plunges viewers into a world where the veil between the natural and the otherworldly grows increasingly thin.

Stevenson's masterful direction is evident from the opening frames, as she deftly establishes an ominous and foreboding atmosphere. The haunting score, composed by the talented Erin Meadows, seamlessly intertwines with the visuals, amplifying the sense of unease that permeates throughout the narrative.

At the heart of the film is the captivating performance of Evelyn Masterson, who portrays the role of Sarah Wilkins, a young woman plagued by visions and premonitions she cannot comprehend. Masterson's nuanced portrayal of Sarah's descent into the enigmatic realm of the occult is nothing short of mesmerizing, effortlessly conveying the inner turmoil and vulnerability of her character.

The supporting cast, including the ever-reliable Michael Tanner as the skeptical yet devoted Detective Ryder, delivers solid performances that complement Masterson's tour de force. Their on-screen chemistry adds depth and authenticity to the unfolding mystery, making the audience invest wholeheartedly in the characters' journeys.

Stevenson's deft handling of the supernatural elements is particularly noteworthy. Instead of relying on cheap jump scares or gratuitous gore, she opts for a more subtle and cerebral approach, allowing the tension to build slowly and methodically. The film's exploration of ancient rituals and esoteric symbolism adds an intriguing layer of depth, inviting viewers to ponder the fine line between reality and the unexplained.

While ""The First Omen"" excels in creating an immersive and unsettling atmosphere, it occasionally stumbles in its pacing, with certain segments feeling slightly protracted. However, these minor hiccups are overshadowed by the film's overall strengths and the masterful storytelling at its core.

In the end, ""The First Omen"" proves to be a captivating and thought-provoking cinematic experience. With its rich tapestry of mystery, mysticism, and psychological horror, the film cements Arkasha Stevenson's reputation as a formidable force in the genre. Undoubtedly, this haunting tale will linger in the minds of viewers long after the credits roll, leaving them both unsettled and enthralled.",7.0,11 June 2024
The prequel no-one asked for.,"The First Omen is a lot like Immaculate, only nowhere near as good.

In Immaculate, a group of devious Catholics in an Italian convent conspire to bring about the second coming of Christ by impregnating an unsuspecting novice nun with a baby engineered from Jesus's DNA; there's a twisted logic to this, but the way they go about things is horrific.

In The First Omen, a group of devious Catholics in an Italian convent, faced with losing power over the general populace, conspire to bring about the birth of The Antichrist with the hope of scaring people back to religion; the logic here is less convincing. Would people who have dedicated their lives to serving God really make a deal with the devil? How could they ever hope to control the Antichrist once he is born? Would their God approve of them unleashing such evil upon the Earth? And how did they get hold of the devil in the first place in order to secure his co-operation?

These awkward questions aside, The First Omen is a disappointing watch thanks to an incredibly slow pace, an overlong runtime of two hours, lacklustre death scenes with an over-reliance on unconvincing CGI (the fire effects on the burning nun were terrible), predictable jump scares, and the fact that the film posits that the devil's acolytes in the original The Omen weren't Satanists after all, but rather crazy, power hungry Catholics. Such retconning of the plot is disrespectful to Richard Donner's brilliant original horror classic.

3.5/10, rounded down to 3 for making me laugh a couple of times: Margaret's lame attempt at covering some stolen files with a tiny blanket, the embarrassingly contrived shot of some candles and lights arranged to resemble a demonic face, and the hilarious scene where Margaret hugs a dying man crushed by a car and comes away holding just his torso.",3.0,6 April 2024

The devil conspiracy.,"I loved the casting, I didn't know anything about the movie so I was surprised to see recognizable faces. A random thought I had while watching this is Father Gabriel is such a common priest name in movies and tv.

I liked that the nuns seemed to be having fun. Usually when a monastery of nuns is shown it's bleak, the nuns are uptight, mean and/or eerie vibes throughout. While here they're introduced as just normal people who can have a laugh or some fun.

Pretty graphic and gory at times. I wasn't such a big fan of the fingers, only the first time shown. There was a girl seated nearby and she was squeamish, it kinda made the experience more fun to hear her scream ""oh no"" in horror, disgust or shock at different moments during the movie.

It takes time to find its footing and for the eerie stuff to properly start; but it does have a creepy ambience to it. Certain characters were very odd and helped that. I loved the score, really helped build up the atmosphere.

My interest peaked when they mentioned the Antichrist. I went into the movie without watching any spoilers or anything so it was a pleasant surprise to see that's what the movie's centered around. I thought it was gonna be some demon possession. I didn't like that they introduced the roommate and we got to see a lot of her at the start; and then she disappears.

The movie had some pretty nice shots. Some scenes that were pretty eerie and ominous. It just that the first half of the movie felt like it was building up to something for so long. It didn't feel like it was actually progressing. I thought the twist would be Margaret turning out to being the mother of Anna or mother of the Antichrist. I don't know if that made it predictable.

I think the last 45min or so were good. The movie is better than Sydney Sweeney's Immaculate. Their premises were similar but this was done better. However the movie it reminded me of most was ""The Devil Conspiracy"" which has one of the wildest synopsis I've ever read. Also surprised to learn afterwards that this isn't the first Omen movie. Others made in 1976 and 2006, the latter with some recognizable faces.

The main actress, Nell Tiger Free, was very dedicated to the role, she had several moments of brilliance. I was kinda shocked at the birth scenes, they drugged the first girl but didn't drug her.

Sets up a sequel well. Not sure a sequel would bang though. I think it'd have to be very ambitious and grand, it is the antichrist after all. But ""the devil conspiracy"" was ambitious but it didn't do too well. But I'd still be interested in watching the sequel.",6.0,15 April 2024
"One of the worst prequels/sequels ever made, horror or not...",,4.0,5 April 2024
Objectively the best Omen film,"There's a prequel to The Omen out and it's actually good! Arkasha Stevenson's The First Omen is aesthetically probably the best in the franchise, going the nightmarish Italian fever dream freak-show horror route rather than blithely through the motions of the original story, which we all are very familiar with. This one takes place a half year or so before the original story as a young American nun (Nell Tiger-Free) arrives in Rome to work for the church but instead senses a growing darkness within the Vatican itself, as a strange sect of devil worshipping kooks prepares for the incoming birth of the Antichrist. But who will be the mother? The plot is predictable as all hell, even a third act twist that one can feel coming a mile away but the fun here isn't in story logic, its in style and atmosphere, both of which the film positively drips with. Tiger-Free is a captivating lead presence, all wide eyed apprehension and unsettling angelic energy, while heavyweights like thunder voiced Ralph Ineson, Sonia Braga, Bill Nighy (sadly a bit underused) and a very creepy Charles Dance show up here and there. So in terms of where this sits in the franchise hierarchically, it's objective I suppose. I find the original to be pretty clunky, the sequels a bit scattered and daft and the 2006 remake, although impeccably casted (Julia Stiles, David Thewlis & Pete Postlethwaite under one roof is a reason to celebrate in itself) pretty uninspired overall. This one though, has the dark gooey and horrifically tactile ambience of something by Rob Zombie or Panos Cosmatos and reaches a diabolically imagined fever pitch of disgusting effects and berserk histrionics (the homage paid to Andzrej's Zulawski's Possession is a tad on the nose) from a totally committed Tiger-Free, and in my eyes stands as the most commanding, singular and well wrought Omen flick to date.",7.0,9 June 2024
Creative but lacking,"The creative cinematography and casting made this an enjoyable movie in my opinion. The story and direction was typical but not the worst. It keeps the dignity of the franchise in tact but doesn't supersede any of its predecessors. I do think it is absolutely worth viewing, no matter your horror standards or nostalgia. There are a couple scenes that gave me the chills and still delivers the universal horror movie feeling that you shouldn't really be watching something like this if you actually care about your own wellbeing. With that said, there are movies that do it better, creepier and scarier... but I was generally happy with the film for what I was expecting.",7.0,8 June 2024
Almost...,"The absolutely raving overboard ""shocking blasphemous a masterpiece"" reviews of this on Twitter have me really confused, if I'm being honest. For me it was good, not great. Nell Tiger Free rules, and it was beautiful looking, but for me the pacing was weird, and it could've gone a lot further with the gore/deaths. In the original Omen the deaths are crazy, and feel very sinister, in this one you're just kind of like ok? Haha .. And they do mess with the original lore a bit which will not sit right with some people. I didn't hate what they did with it though. I guess the raving reviews just set my expectations a little too high. And maybe a director's cut would be different. I did like it though, and it's def worth a watch. I would encourage those who like this to watch Paco Plaza's Sister Death and Veronica, both superior imo.",7.0,7 April 2024
Nuns are fashionable this year,"Hot on the heels of Immaculate, we have another American would-be nun (Nell Tiger Free) travelling to an Italian convent to be initiated. As in Immaculate, things seem off from the start; as in Immaculate we have creepy nuns, a creepy cardinal, spooky visions and a death.

Unlike in Immaculate, we know exactly where this film is going (the big reveal can't have surprised more than a handful of viewers) but, to its credit, this film ties itself in neatly to the original Omen, and manages to do so with some style.

Despite the title pretty much giving away the whole plot, the film manages a decent level of suspense, and the visceral nastiness is well-handled. The performances are faultless throughout.

There's a surprise extra element to the ending, suggesting that a sequel is at least planned, though how this with fit into the Omenverse (everything's a Verse, these days) remains to be seen.",7.0,7 April 2024
"Best horror movie of 2024, jaw was dropped for half the movie.","Yes best movie of 2024 may be a bit of a stretch but for someone who Loves Horror movies without the cheesy one liners and a plot solely based on jumpscares than this is the movie for you, as you rarely see a horror movie that can make you scared without excessive amounts of jump scares.

If old creepy religious movies that bend your mind is your go to, buy some tickets and go and watch this now. Some people will complain about the length of the scenes or that it was ""dragged on"" but sit down and actually appreciate the stories perspective and attention to detail. I usually pick my phone up here and there to check the time and see when the film finishes but didn't even think about it once, for a 2 hour long movie it really kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.

I noticed The film was full of the number 13, which is beautifully placed into the background of scenes via objects. The cinematology was also absolutely beautiful, and really was immersive and creepy. Ignore the negative reviews go in and get your own opinion as it's worth the watch and experience.

The First Omen,"Novice ""Margaret"" (Nell Tiger Free) arrives in Rome to a welcome from her cardinal sponsor ""Lawrence"" (Bill Nighy) where she hopes to complete taking her vows. She is greeted with open arms and taken on a tour of what she hopes will become her new home. This is when she encounters the shy ""Carlita"" (Nicole Sorace) who spends much of her time in solitude drawing. This intrigues ""Margaret"" but not as much as some of the other goings on in the maternity ward of the hospital. Her concerns are only exacerbated by a meeting with ""Fr. Brennan"" (Ralph Ineson) who spins her an horrific yarn that makes her head spin and sets her on a detection task that reveals a conspiracy to end all conspiracies - one that is conceived by the church for it's own perpetuation, but that could bring down both it and mankind. At times it's quite a decently paced watch, this, with a little gruesomeness (isn't it odd that the tools of medicine so often look like those of torture?) but given we have known the denouement since 1976 the lack of any real jeopardy does rather rob the film of much of a sense of menace and what ""jump moments"" there are are all a bit predictable. Free does try to imbue her character with a bit of passion, and she manages along well enough but Nighy is weak and the single appearance from Charles Dance adds nothing at all to these lacklustre proceedings. Prequels are always hard to deliver. This tries, but sadly we've seen it all before and I fear the nun theme is beginning to self-flagellate itself to death. A short story over-stretched.",6.0,10 April 2024
Cheap Cash Grab on Nostalgia,"What was supposed to be a golden opportunity to jump-start the franchise turned out to be a cheap, dull, infantile attempt at cash grab without substance. The iconic moments that made the original movie so powerful now appear as an empty echo when re-created here, without a real element of fear through and through.

Talents of the veteran actor Ralph Ineson is completely wasted. The rest of the cast do not captivate or steal the scenes in any way. Jump scares do not work and the overall sence of mystique that adorned the original film is gone. Not to mention the continuity errors that do not line up with the overall story. Absolute waste.",3.0,1 June 2024
I needed this. Hollywood pay attention to this film.,"The First Omen.

9.2/10.

Finally a real horror film.

PLEASE be the start of a new wave. This is ""Shining-esque"" and I'm sad it's over. I don't even like religious films. If you love films. Horror. See this as soon as possible IN THEATRES.

With all the garbage horror films being made someone finally took the time, love and passion to create one of the best horror films I have seen in years.

Arkasha thank you. You have earned a fan and I need you to make more.

What A Debut,"So I watched this and 'Monkey Man' in the same night, and they seem to have quite a few things in common. I liked them both, both released the same day, both British directors, both directors involved in the writing, both directorial debuts, and artwork that looks very similar. Are they good friends or something? 👀

While Rosemary's Baby (1968) is one of my favourite horror movies of all time, I've always had issues with the ending. Had the ending been similar to The First Omen, I'd rate Rosemary's Baby a lot more.

I don't think my praise for this movie can get any higher than that, but don't get it twisted, this isn't me saying this movie is up there with Rosemary's Baby, it's a really good horror movie that sticks the landing well.",7.0,27 May 2024
"disappointing, disjointed, tedious and boring","First of I feel like invoicing whoever wrote this for the cost of my cinema ticket and the 2 hours of my life I will never get back.

It obviously had a big budget and some good actors but that is definitely all.

After the first 30 minutes I began wondering when something was actually going to happen?

Then you realise this is another of the ever growing number of films that at a glance look cosmetically good. However, on watching you quickly realise it is all hype and hot air. There is no substance let alone a credible story.

The acting was mediocre at best. Script /plot is just a collection of disjointed scenes that lack the connection of a coherent story.

In short I paid good money to watch absolute bilge. 1/10

BTW the tenuous ink to the Omen is a picture of Gregory Peck right at the very end.

"Far Better than Catholic bashing Immaculate, But ...","Bring the brand ""The Omen"" and ""Damien Omen"" requires a very good story and impactful story to affect the whole franchise. There are too many Hollywood remakes and expansions that disappoint fans of the series already.

And with the Catholic church bashing movement in Hollywood, it's difficult to differentiate the good and the bad.

The First Omen has a very eerie approach while maintaining old visual presentation that delivered scenes reminiscence of the original The Omen. Being a prequel, gave the creative team freedoms to explore possibilities that has never been touched.

The selection of actors was unexpectedly excellent. Each actor has their share contribution to the story. I do love Charles Dance short screen time but effectively illustrate the madness he endured.

As for the Catholic church bashing movement, The First Omen chose the path of warning the audience that even in holiest religious establishment there is a possibility of a group of people who did bad things. Unfortunately, it's not explored further than that which drop their acore for me personally, it's an incomplete communication.

The exploration also included some graphic scenes of horror, violence and sexual scenes. I can accept some of them were necessary, but again there are too many questions unanswered and abrupt conclusion begged questions instead.

For fans of The Omen, this is a good one to watch.",7.0,5 June 2024
A Demonic Debut Steeped in Suspense,"Arkasha Stevenson's ""The First Omen"" isn't just a prequel, it's a possession of its own. This chilling horror film slithers back to 1971, weaving a narrative of faith, fear, and the unthinkable birth of evil. While it doesn't quite reach the iconic status of its 1976 predecessor, ""The First Omen"" delivers thanks to a captivating performance by Nell Tiger Free and a masterfully unsettling atmosphere.

Free shines as Margaret, a young novitiate summoned to Rome by a mysterious cardinal (played with delightful ambiguity by Bill Nighy). Thrust into a world of ancient secrets and unsettling rituals, Margaret's unwavering faith begins to crumble as she uncovers a plot to usher in the Antichrist. Stevenson masterfully builds dread, relying less on jump scares and more on a pervasive sense of wrongness that crawls under your skin. The film's 70s setting is beautifully rendered, with the opulent Vatican contrasting starkly with Margaret's growing unease.

However, ""The First Omen"" isn't without flaws. The middle section drags slightly, relying on a scavenger hunt-like plot that feels a tad derivative. Additionally, some may find the film's graphic birth scene, while undeniably impactful, to be a touch excessive.

Despite these minor stumbles, Stevenson's vision remains captivating. The film's true strength lies in its central performance. Free delivers a powerhouse portrayal of a woman grappling with the monstrous truth. Her journey from unwavering faith to fierce defiance is both terrifying and strangely inspiring.

""The First Omen"" might not be a flawless masterpiece, but it's a worthy addition to the Omen franchise. It boasts a chilling atmosphere, a standout lead performance, and a refreshingly original take on the origin story. If you're looking for a horror film that will stay with you long after the credits roll, ""The First Omen"" deserves a place on your watchlist. Just remember, keep the lights on...",7.0,11 June 2024
NOT BAD!,Prequels in general drive me crazy! They always try to oversell something and make pieces fit that absolutely will not fit! I have to admit that this is one that actually does not do that. Was it perfect? No.....but it is one of the best horror movie prequels that I've seen along with the ALIEN franchise. What made this one so enjoyable to watch was the simplistics of it. From the music and sound effects to the acting cast and special effects. There were a couple of missteps in here but nothing that couldn't be overlooked. My GENRE of choice is and will always be horror (all categories). HULU has had some hits and some misses with original movies.... Hell...all the the streaming services have BUT don't stop trying because this is one that that was a pretty good hit. Enjoy the movie first and then critique it.,7.0,9 June 2024
good,"The film The first Omen is a solid achievement.

The lead actress (Nell Tiger) is a very beautiful woman who has gone out of her way to do her job very seriously.

The weakest part of the film is certainly the scenario in which the Catholic Church is portrayed as a godless institution that uses Faith as a lever of power. What Father Brennan said that there are also True Believers is completely insufficient, because everything takes place in a completely non-ecclesiastical sequence of actions and events (the Holy Mysteries and the power of the Cross are not used at all against satanic activity).

The idea that growing secularism weakens the worldly power of the Catholic Church is extremely inappropriate because secularism is also very aggressive and full of lies, and that is very clear to everyone.

The idea that any Church of Christ (Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox ...) would bow down to Satan for the sake of some kind of preservation is especially absurd.

It is completely clear that the appearance of the Antichrist will mean the destruction of the World and an attempt to destroy the Christian Faith.

According to the words of Christ, no one would remain, if God himself, Jesus Christ, did not come a second time in Divine glory.

In the film, Satanism was forced into the Catholic Church, which is not natural and normal.

The Catholic Church itself has real trials such as pedophile scandals and dogmatic interpretations of the Pope about its role and the Catholic Church itself, so it is not right to add such a satanic conspiracy plan to its essence.

I believe that the Catholic Church will offer strong resistance in those antichrist times.

The shots in the film, the Italian ambience of the 70s, the direction and everything else is excellent.

The film is a refresher for the horror genre.",6.0,1 June 2024
A horror treat for horror fans....,"The First Omen will give you a terrific experience of horror, and some very disturbing scenes which will make you think what you have watched.

First of all I didn't watch any of the previous films of this franchise was completely gone with zero expectations but after watching it I can say one thing for sure this is the best horror I've seen in recent times.. Superb direction by Director Arkasha specially the way she has presented the film wih every scene is just amazing to see.

Movie builds up a strong scary atmosphere which will definitely maintais the balance of horror & some terrific thriller portions that audience will not expect.

From the first scene itself the movie indicates you that this isn't a generic horror you've come to watch because it has a strong gore & violence substance which definitely the story demands and the director didn't hesitate to show.

Screenplay is well engaged yest it takes time at the start but still you'll be interested to hear more whereas Cinematography is also quite good at some places with unique camera shots and frames were shown.

NELL TIGER is the soul of this film in every frame she shines and there's a scene in the film where she kinda fights with evil that scene is just pure goosebumps for me and the performance of her in that scene is 🔥.

Story isn't new that we haven't seen previously but what makes this film better is the performance of actors and proper direction by Arkasha Stevenson.

Overall this movie for me is unexpectedly good because it's surprise you at many points rather than a typical horror. It has horror but don't expect it to be light hearted because there are some serious scenes which some people are not gonna like... (4/5).",8.0,5 April 2024
It could have been much more,"So, first of all: Damien's mother was a jackal. That is fact, also a crucial point in both three movies. I don't get it, why they left out. It wouldn't have been a bigger scandal, than the one they left in the film. Probably because of the age rating, but hey: do it right, or don't do it at all. At least that's my opinion.

The cult is somewhat ok. Satanists must be pleased as well, I get it. They still pay for the tickets :) And, we know from the first Omen, that a sect was behind the intentional swap of the babies.

The cheap jump scares: ewww. Stop them please, they're really outdated and overused by now. Not to mention, they take away the edge of the real horror atmosphere.

Sure theu got the name right and all but still. Major mi9stake if you ask me and a very big missed opportunity.

Otherwise the movie has great pace and the acting was better than expected. I will not give more than a 4 because of the jackal blunder which I think was a big mistake. The movie is a solid prequel though. I counted 3 jump scares which is better than the majority of horror movies today.",4.0,2 June 2024
"Genuinely one of, if not, the most unsettling films I have ever experienced","I have not been shaken to my core by a film or television series in years. I thought I had grown numb to horror, occasionally being grossed out by gore or weirded out by some wild concept. This film was different. It brought something out of me I hadn't felt in ages: pure terror.

The story is a slow burn at the beginning, but once it picks up momentum at the end of the first act it does not take a break or slow down. If anything, it picks up speed, and leans into the nefarious ideas presented in this plot.

The acting was superb, especially the lead role of Margaret. She stole the spotlight for the entirety of the third act, despite all of the other intricate pieces moving around her character. Nell Tiger Free has the ability to move her body and control her emotions in such ways that were nothing short of breathtaking, both in the most lovely and demonic senses of the word.

Finally, the ideals and concepts presented in this film are going to live rent-free in my mind for quite some time. I left this film feeling slightly foggy, bogged down by the weight of what I had just experienced. That is not to say that this film was bad by any means, if anything the opposite. It executed its purpose precisely as it had set out to do. It left an impression on me, as well as my friend who I saw it with, one that we agreed would almost certainly give us nightmares and/or keep us awake tonight.

For any horror fan, this is a must-see. Truly underrated unexpected. 9/10.",9.0,9 April 2024
Very Good Prequel,"Taking place before the events of the first film, The First Omen follows a young nun who moves to Italy and uncovers terrifying conspiracies in the church as they try to birth the anti-Christ.

Nell Tiger Free gives an astounding performance as the young nun caught in a web of religious terror and there are several images that are unforgettable. The Omen franchise doesn't need another sequel or prequel, but The First Omen makes a good case for having one out there in the world. Fantastic cinematography and sound mixing help an awful lot and help to create an unforgettable movie experience. It makes me eager to see where they could possibly go next with this franchise.",7.0,25 May 2024

"Excellent, Brilliant, and Demonically Scary 😈😈😈","The prequel to the 1976 classic The Omen this movie tells the story of a nun who is migrated to Rome under the catholic homage to provide service there .As the plot unfolds she comes to know about the sinister secrets and hidden agendas of the priest and the nuns there .As things get more darker it's come to her disclosure that they have a plot to give birth to the antichrist through the anointing of a child by delivering the baby to the devil .And the rest of the story is whether she would be able to stop it or whether there is more that she's to know about finding the assigned child who is to give birth .Nell Tiger has given a convincing performance as sister Margaret and has captured the essence of the story .Although it isn't the most terrifying and scariest movie out there it is definitely an interesting watch and there are chilly moments and sequences that keep you glued to the story and curious to find out about what's going to happen. The cinematography and background score have been exceptional and does manage to create an eerie atmosphere throughout.

This is a fantastic film. The production is gorgeous, not only is it a well-made portrayal of past Omen films except Omen 4., other than the brilliant slower pace and the sheer patience of specific scenes that enhances the moment, it also throws in 70s era cars and fashion that is fun to see. I thought the classic panning in and out of the camera was very much similar to older films of that era...just wonderful. It's just done so well that I feel this is perhaps the best horror film I've ever seen not just by plot alone but by its close attention to the art form in general. When you see a horror movie, you want to feel somewhat trapped. The movie is that intense. I even found myself looking at dark spots in the theater thinking it was a ghost or demon watching me! You won't and can't be disappointed with this movie, highly recommended.",9.0,5 April 2024
Not worth the hype,"Came here for Bill Nighy and Charles Dance. What a disappointment. Great actors underutilized, yet the lead female is such a lackluster character that forces emotional appearance and reaction.

And, why do directors think showing black screens with background screams increases the terror intensity for the audience? We want to see the action, period!

For the kind of budget suggested here, this was a rather shoddy piece of art that went on for too long when 80 minutes would have sufficed.

Watch it if you have ample time on your hands but willing to suffer through an imitation of the horror genre that is easily forgotten.",3.0,1 June 2024
Great prequel!,"In 1976, director Richard Donner came up with The Omen. We also know Donner from films like Lethal Weapon and of course Superman from 1978. In the lead role, Gregory Peck played the role of Robert Thorn, an American ambassador to Rome who tragically loses his first child at birth, but has it exchanged for a baby where the mother died at birth. Unfortunately, Thorn adopts the antichrist and with that story Donner scared the viewers. The film then got two more sequels, with the epic about Damien ending in 1983, at least, it seemed. There was a fourth part where the antichrist returns in the form of a girl, but this was so hopelessly bad that we prefer to forget that part. It remained quiet until 2006, when suddenly a remake of the original The Omen came, although this was not a really bad movie, it was a strange decision because the original was good enough and didn't need a remake. In 2016 there was another very nicest series called Damien, which unfortunately only ran for one season. Now there is The First Omen a prequel to The Omen from 1976 directed by director Arkasha Stevenson, who makes her first cinema film. This is risky with such a film of course, but Stevenson debuts with a strong prequel, where it is to be hoped that more will follow.

What the film excels in is that it doesn't follow the standard route by using a jumpscare every few seconds to entertain the audience. No, The First Omen is more than that. It's a real slow burner, because the film takes a good time at the beginning to properly portray the situation. When Maggie arrives in Rome, Cardinal Lawrence explains to her that there are popular riots between Italian citizenship, including motivated by students who are dissatisfied with the state and the Holy Church. This ensures that the church people could sometimes make it difficult to go down the street. Just before Margaret is initiated by the church, she goes out for another evening on the advice and invitation of her roommate Luz. Margaret drinks and dances with a man and wakes up the next day with no memories of the evening in question. Of course you already feel the mood hanging and you realize that there is more going on than you would expect at first glance. As life moves on again, Margaret gains a strong bond with Carlita, an orphan plagued by the most heimous visions. And then she meets Father Brennan out of nowhere who warns her about Carlita and that bad things are going to happen around her. But Margaret doesn't believe him until a heilful incident takes place.

In any case, the film literally takes place before the prologue of The Omen (1976), which ensures that this film seamlessly connects to The Omen (1976) in terms of story. What the film also excels in is the cinematography, for that reason alone, The First Omen is worth watching. But the time picture from the 70s is also strongly represented, making the connection of this film feel quite natural to The Omen (1976). The film does have quite a few slums scenes that make the film rather controversial, because not everyone will be able to appreciate this. Especially the childbirth scene is one where you can ask your questions about whether it is necessary to portray this in this way. In my opinion, yes, because this gives an extra sinister view of the whole event, after all, we are dealing with the ultimate evil here and the devil will leave nothing behind to sow pure terror of course. In that regard, the creators were not guided by what others would think of it and they just went their business. The ending may not come as a surprise, because although an attempt is made to give it a surprising twist, it is actually clear after a little while in the film how or what, but luckily that doesn't bother.

The First Omen is the cinema debut of director Arkasha Stevenson on the classic The Omen (1976). That's quite dangerous, but Stevenson has done a fantastic job and The First Omen has really become a strong prequel. It fits seamlessly with The Omen (1976) and that is a nice side effect. The film is nowhere to become slugber and in addition, the film is sometimes really eye-catching cinematographically. Fortunately, the makers have not put themselves on a constant supply of jumpscares, as most makers do. No, The First Omen is a real slow burner, which gets more under your skin by the minute and eventually competes with a singing climax. Although this may be stingling, it's not surprising, but that doesn't matter at all, because if as a maker you can make a prequel to one of the most controversial horror films of all time, then you really have to come from good houses. Richard Donner will probably have been proud of how this film lives up to his 1976 classic.",8.0,31 May 2024
An absolute insult to the original Omen,,3.0,13 April 2024
The First Omen surpasses expectations and delivers an impressive addition to the horror genre. I was thoroughly impressed with every aspect of this movie,"Tonight, I watched The First Omen (2024) in theaters. The storyline follows an American woman who moves to Rome to live a life under the church, teaching in an orphanage. There's something unique about one of the girls at the orphanage, hinting at a strange hidden plot unfolding...

Directed by Arkasha Stevenson in her major motion picture debut, and starring Nell Tiger Free (Game of Thrones), Ralph Ineson (The Witch), Sônia Braga (Kiss of the Spider Woman), Charles Dance (Game of Thrones), and Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest).

This movie exceeded my expectations by a mile. Throughout the entire film, I found myself questioning why it was so good. The First Omen brilliantly captures the era in every aspect - from attire to backdrops, camera angles, and lighting, evoking a nostalgic 70s feel. The storyline is clever and fits perfectly within the series. The acting is remarkably good. There are at least 6-7 standout horror scenes that deserve a perfect 10/10 rating - such as the gripping glass sequence at the opening, the good acting at the car crash, and every birthing scene. The atmosphere throughout the film is deeply unsettling; you're constantly piecing together the mystery, with well-executed jump scares keeping you on edge. Even the use of CGI fire, which I typically dislike, was easy to dismiss because the scene was fantastic. And the ending? Absolutely perfect.

In conclusion, The First Omen surpasses expectations and delivers an impressive addition to the horror genre. I was thoroughly impressed with every aspect of this movie. I would give it an 8-8.5/10 strongly recommended it.",8.0,6 April 2024
Revelations: This Is Dumb,"Lmao. First 5 minutes and I knew who was going to be the person who crapped out the Anti Christ. I firmly believe there should be a committee that has the right to sue absolutely uneducated and inexperienced directors, producers and script writers, for scamming more intelligent people that should have their jobs. Every time a movie is predictable and bears no originality should be sued so we can get our money back and the director should be in the $200 million debt that they decided to bring upon themselves. This is basically stealing from people in broad day light. There really needs to be a group of people that have the right to sue these so called directors so we can get our money back and so they never make another movie ever again.

Horrible and Dumb,,1.0,8 April 2024
By far the best thing you could see today in such overused genre,"I mean, seriously, we are living the age of running out of ideas, rehashing old materials, rebooting/remaking franchises, seeing all kinds of cliché tropes in such limited genre as the horror can offer. In the last decade the subgenre like retro-horror/psychohorror also emerged that many times brought back the essence of past ages, like the 70s, 80s, that also becoming dull now.

And here comes The First Omen that already by the first scene it reminds you of the old movies, like it was straight made in the 70s; oldschool film-like image framing, scene blocking, grains, the color palette, the environment, costumes and props totally fitting to the giving time of age, everything hits that classic, oldies line, it will easily remind you of The Exorcist opening scenes (1973)

The cinematography is mind-blowing... seriously, just for that you should see it; the visual narrative is so sophisticated, almost elegant in a classic way, that it will be a total unique experience to watch for such genre as this in the modern days. I was literally shocked how perfect it is. Whoever was working on this understands moviemaking, on the highest level, especially how good horror movies work. It's on par of the level of The Exorcist, or Kubrick's The Shining.

This is a classic horror movie mixed with modern trends, finding the right balance between these two worlds. It will have clichés that you were seeing in most motion pictures in the genre, but still presented in such manner you won't sigh or feel numb, because it totally gets it's own boundaries.

The casting and acting is also superb, the main character might seem a bit off in early stages, but damn, as the third act hits in, what a sight to see. You will see body movements (yeah) done in almost dancing-like manner you will ask yourself ""How the hell did she do that even? That's amazing!""

So, back to the presentation: yes, it is considered slow-paced for modern standards, gives time for the whole theme and the fright that it beholds deeply digging into you as it can, and it will have the right ammount of power doing that, damn, it elevates to such dark, deep rotting horror emotions that will most possibly compensate for the slow-pacing (even though this is the right tempo for me, but could understand it might be problematic for some), and in this the whole music, sound nature of the movie also gives some hand. Overall terrific execution presentation-wise.

So, long story short: It might hold some cliché, modern movie making tropes, even story-wise that are coming from both the limitation of the genre/sub-genre and also the fact of it being a prequel for an existing movie, however the high level of understanding movie making in general and the execution of that will most probably make you easily forgive those little shortcomings, as the movie in general is hitting hard, as dark as it can get, as it should be for a horror movie. Easily one of the best horror movies of the decade, and that's not even an overstatement.

P. S.: A week ago I also watched the Immaculate and I honestly feel the absolute right comparing these two especially in the context of the difference between modern and classic horror moviemaking. Immaculate is so bad compared to this that I would feel ashamed of watching it if not seeing the parallel between these two... a really shameful product. So yeah, The First Omen all the way.",8.0,7 April 2024

Restored my faith in supernatural horror,"I lost any interest in supernatural horror in the early 2010's, and I ended completely giving up on the genre after watching the conjuring 2 (one of the worst horror movies ever made, in my opinion). It wasn't until last year when I saw ""Talk to me"" which I really enjoyed and gave me hope and then ""the exorcist"", which I didn't hate, but this film, really got me thinking that not all is lost in the genre and good supernatural horror films can still be made.

I'm not a person who thinks that ""there's nothing and there will never by anything like the original"" because I love a lot of remakes more than the originals and I actually find it very hard to enjoy cinema from the 70's or 80's, but there was something about the original omen saga that made me love it since I first watched it as a teenager. I loved how it didn't rely on creatures or jump scares to make you feel stressed and uneasy, unlike most of the films on the genre, that for many years have completely relied on funny-looking demonic creatures and way too many jump scares in order to try make you feel anything and failing poorly in the attempt.

I loved how this film captured the tone and the style from the original films and really made me feel like watching something from the 70's while doing its own thing and making it even better at the same time. I loved that like the original, it's also a slow burn and it takes it's time to fully unravel without ever getting boring, I loved the cinematography in general and the music, which is what ultimately makes the film so effective and unsettling.

Storywise, I liked that by making the main character an american girl in Italy, it very easily justified why everyone she interacted with spoke english, instead of just having everyone speaking english with an italian accent for no reason. I liked the explanation they gave for the birth of satan's child and why was itimportant. I liked the acting of everyone, specially the main character, I found her performance very believable and really made me feel bad for her. I did not like carlita though (the child), I found her acting hard to believable and rather annoying at times.

I loved the ""satanic imagery"" whoed thoughout the film, they really found interesting and original ways of showing images and shots that make you think of the devil without the cliches used in most movies of the genre.

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie in every way, of course it does have some overused resources, as most films do, and it has some plot holes and things that don't make no sense and I can't say this is one of my personal favorite horror films or films in general, but for a genre that was having awful film, after bad film, over and over again, this one was surprisingly good and I totally recommend it.",8.0,10 April 2024
Awful Film,"I had the misfortune to go and watch this film today at my local Odeon. In my humble and honest opinion, this film was dire. The story lacked cohesion and seemed to be all over the place and the soundtrack was absolutely abysmal. I have watched the original 3 instalments and even the third one, which I consider the weakest entry, is much better than this.

They claim it is a prequel to the original 1976 film starring Gregory Peck, but then go and contradict some very important elements of the original.

I won't go into any details as I don't want to include any spoilers in this review.

There were some positives: the actors and actresses all did a superb job with the material they were given and the cinematography was beautiful in most shots.

I fully understand that film, like other art forms, is subjective and who knows, maybe you may watch it and love it, but for me, this is one film I don't plan to ever watch again.",1.0,5 April 2024
It's all about the atmosphere,"This horror movie is a representative of its genre that does not (mainly) rely on cheap jump scares to create horror. On the contrary, the movie creates horror through its atmosphere, which is created by the sets, the score, the camera, the actors and the story. There are jump scares, but very few, and the movie doesn't rely on them. For me, this puts the movie in the same category as other horror movies like The VVitch (interestingly, this movie also stars Ralph Ineson, who also plays the father in The VVitch and the score of this movie is by Mark Korven, who also created the score for the VVitch).

Maybe this horror movie is not as scary as others are but if you like horror movies like The VVitch, go and see this one.",8.0,14 April 2024

"Surprising, thoughtfully made and thought-provoking - don't be surprised to see Tiger Free get Oscar nominated for this. 8/10","When is a horror movie not a horror movie? When it's directed by someone who doesn't want to recreate something that's been done to death , is restricted by an existing story so instead, creates an ""art-house"" style psychological horror that jars, repulses and engrosses in equal measures. It's not that it isn't scary- in parts it is, but this isn't so much about jump scares as about the visceral, hideous nature of what you slowly realize you're going to see and the claustrophobic and understanding of the terrible consequences of this. Beautifully crafted, filmed and directed, the script is strong and acting , excellent. Particularly the lead, and her ""flat-mate"" and the young girl she's trying to protect. Ralph Ineson and Bill Nighy are outstanding too. Overall, this is a more rounded , intelligent story than even the original but simply because it's 2024, it remains to be seen how it stands up to the 1976 classic . The vulnerability of Margaret is certainly not a horror novelty but is a first for this particular franchise and only if you are prepared to treat it on its own merits will you truly appreciate the cleverness which Stevenson displays with The First Omen.

It's an extremely different film to the rest of the franchise but very very powerful. What are womens' bodies for? What is the real reason behind the power of the Catholic Church? And what if the idea of an anti-Christ proved more real than what we assume?

I think that the subplots and idealogies that underpin The First Omen will stay with people for a long time. It's not trying to be Oppenheimer of course. But it's also not just a ""horror film"". This movie exists on at least three levels- as a neat(ish) explanation/prelude to The Omen; as a very good, contemporary horror film. And finally, as a thought-provoking exploration of how we treat our fellow beings, particularly the vulnerable and just how cruel and ruthless certain organisations are prepared to be at times.

The First Omen...A MUST SEE!!,"As an avid moviegoer, that normally stays away from horror movies, I'm so glad I didn't stay away from The First Omen. It is exhilarating to say the least! It is a beautifully made and well executed psychological horror film that is a worthy prequel to the original 1976 Omen classic. Arkasha Stevenson's vision for the movie is brilliantly executed and is terrifying, disturbing and beautifully shot with twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat and wanting more. The cast is absolutely amazing and Nell Tiger Free's dedication to the role of Margaret was off the charts!! What a remarkable studio movie debut for Arkasha Stevenson and co-writer Tim Smith!

That movie was HORRIBLE! Did we all see the same movie?,"Jesus guys, did we all see the same movie???

After reading all these over-the-top positive reviews from people, saying this was the best horror prequel, I was expecting to be shocked to the core, but what I got instead, was an absolute bore-fest.

I've seen more shocking movies on TV while hanging up my washing on a Tuesday at 2pm!

I'm lost for words and I try to figure out how all these positive reviews came about. Are you sure you watched the same film as me? Were you all paid???

The shocks are predictable, the jump scares are predictable, everything is so predictable and I knew how the movie ends after 10 minutes in. The ADR on Ineson was shocking. Could have pulled back the lows on him a bit.

And this incredibly annoying score. Made me miss Maestro Jerry Goldsmith even more!

Almost something incredibly special!,"I'm not sure on a score for this. I should start ny saying I'm not a big horror fan. However I was excited for this one based on the cinematic trailer (the short one with no speech) which looked beautiful with amazing cinematography. I knew the film itself couldn't purely follow this but it was still excellent throughout. There are some stunning images that you usually don't find in horror. The music and sound was also good, and, although I'm not a horror fan, there was a good mix of horror, gore and some good jump scares (I say good - I hate them!). I am going to have to sit and consider this, but my issue immediately after viewing is that the whole premise of the film - the storyline - was silly and made no sense at all. It was ridiculously unrealistic imo and really spoilt what would have otherwise been my fave modern horror, although it's still one of my favourite films of the year so far. There were a few plot-holes but these are overshadowed by the whole film being one! It did segue into the original Omen film pretty well but when you look at the original film it only undermines the storyline on this one even further. I also wasn't sure about the casting of Bill Nighy or Ralph Ineson at all -(although I am a fan of both) but the other performances across the board were excellent. However, it's still the most impressively shot film I have seen this year and it is worth watching for that alone. Lots of similarities with Immaculate but that is nowhere near this good for me - although the storyline a little more believable!",9.0,7 April 2024
Pope on a rope,"This movie is so boring. I fell asleep watching it. Nothing horror about it. The title for this movie should have been Margaret, she is almost on the screen like 98% of it and she is so boring, her acting is so bad. The storyline is almost the same with the movie Immaculate.

Very disappointed not a patch on the original film. Had high hopes for this film. But left the cinema feeling it could have been done so much better.

A PhenOMENal Horror Flick of 2024,"So I've finally got the chance to watch the First Omen, which is a prequel to The Omen, made from 1976, and it was very interesting story and an incredible set back to the 70s where all the evil began, many years ago! This movie was more terrifying than I could ever imagine!

When I first saw The Omen, I never felt pretty terrified and my skin was crawling through fear and The First Omen delivers that same original vibes with the music and the scares and all the thrills horrifying moments that was so well delivered! Everything about this movie was phenOMENal!

Nell Tiger Free, did such a great job with her role and she's literally the first actress to perform such a brilliant icon for many horror genres like never before! Bill Nighy, and every actors was so well beyond brilliant, the acting was incredible, the horror was fantastic, the scares and chills is all every horror fans needed!

Nah,"I love the original Omen trilogy. Well the first two I love, the third I enjoy but not as much as the first two which in my mind are two of the greatest horror movies ever produced. The third, as much as I love Sam Neill as our grown up Jesus hating Antichrist Damien, is just a bit mediocre when compared to the other two. Good, but not great. So I awaited with great interest and anticipation when I heard about the release of this movie to see it, even more so when I heard Blumhouse wasn't involved (he's the Antichrist of remakes..).

Admittedly I have been massively disappointed of late with the reboots but have approached every single one with a fresh mind and even enjoyed a couple along the way. This however falls short in a lot of areas. For a kick off its boring and predictable. If you didn't guess the twist by the time Nighy appears then you need to work on your guessing game. I was waiting and waiting for something memorable to happen and it just didn't.

The casting of Chris Finch as Fr. Brennan was also a huge mistake. Forget the popes exorcist on a moped, he's the priest in a Dacia. Patrick Thornton was insanely good (no pun) in the original film and he just didn't live up to that. It's a big character to take on and a massive role for Ralph and it just didn't work for me.

The film also falls foul of unnecessary plot changes. To make a prequel you have to stick to the plot, you can't just rewrite the history we know within a movie, we've seen so many prequels fall foul of this and it just doesn't work. Unfortunately in this movie the changes are massive and have certainly been made I feel just to warrant follow-ups. Certain characters have even completely swapped allegiance which is just unforgivable in a movie franchise of this significance.

There's some good solid gore, however even this is unoriginal with one specific scene ripped right from the original movie and another which is just a mish mash of two scenes from Damien. Some acll it nods to the originals, I think it's unimaginative. It's a new film, think of new things to do otherwise it's just another missed opportunity to add something to an already well established and much loved.

The film also dares us to explore a new origin for the purpose of Damian which again has no bearing on the original, evil was for evils sake and it doesn't need to differ. The ever present fight between good and evil is enough to satisfy most and to try and take it down another path was trying to justify elements of the original that didn't need justifying in the first place.

It isn't all bad. I liked Nell Tiger Free as our main protagonist, she has a great screen presence and no doubt we'll be seeing more of her in the next instalments, which is good as I'll watch them just to see where they try to take it.",2.0,29 May 2024
From the eternal sea he rises...,"Imagine you took the original Omen movie and mashed it up with Rosemary's Baby, then sprinkled in a bit of The Exorcist and added a touch of Alien Resurrection and Prometheus as a garnish. Bake for approximately two hours, and you'll have a rough approximation of The First Omen experience. There's plenty of Omenesque atmosphere, chanting in Latin... the usual, and you'll also be entertained by a handful of gruesome deaths, though nothing overly imaginative. There's some rather graphic clinical sequences, which the more squeamish might not appreciate... and then there's ""THE Scene"" (well more like a few seconds of footage) which everyone is chatting about and almost earned the film an NC-17 rating. It was worth a chuckle.

The underlying premise of why the Catholic clergy and nuns involved in the creation of Damien is rather contrived and a bit silly. Alas, audiences are also jaded these days, so there was no fainting or barfing, as what happened when The Exorcist premiered. Regardless, The First Omen is a refreshing horror romp which certainly delivers (in more ways than one).",8.0,9 April 2024

Every plot point that had you wondering ""how will they tie this up?"" somehow gets tied so well!

Apparently, in whatever subpar directors point of view jump scares are all you need to qualify as a (horror) movie!

Personally, I found absolutely nothing enjoyable about this movie and the scariest thing about it is that I will never get the two hours back from my life that I spent watching it.

Horror Of The Year,"The First Omen is the horror movie of the year. Unlike so many new additions to classic horror films ( Exorcist Believer, Texas Chainsaw , the last 2 Halloweens ) the first Omen is an actual well thought out and interesting film. The point of this was not a cash grab and its very evident. It dragged a little at the beginning but it picks up and strives throughout. Its shot in a way that builds the film up so well. It's very slowed paced for a while but its purpose is to tie together Margret and Carlita for obvious reasons. As the film continues on we get a somewhat odd but creative story and reason behind how Damien came to be. I am sure some people will be able to predict the twist but I felt like it was so well done and felt original. When it comes to the horror, it's not scary. There is a creepy aura at certain points but the horror itself is fully based off of the creepiness of the visions that are shown. I don't believe that it's an issue that there was not a lot of horror coming from the fact that the original Omen had even less horror. With that being said don't go in expecting a bunch of jump-scares or anything. Another major problem people seem to have is that its similar to every other convent set film. Yes it is set there, yes its kind of similar to the recent immaculate, in terms of looks, and yes it does it better then probably all of the convent/nun films. Lastly, I have seen many people say this does not do the original Omen justice. I fully believe that it does. Some things in the First Omen were not mentioned in the original trilogy. Even though they were not mentioned they helped bring sense to this film. I would have a problem if it directly overwritten what was in the original but it did not. Overall I think that this was a great film and I suggest this to everyone.",9.0,12 April 2024
Disappointed after 20 minutes,"I haven't watch the original movie in years, and didn't pick up on most of the fan service references like many others have. I was just disappointed. After a strong opening, the movie fell flat and never recovered. The pacing was too slow to keep my interest. Of course the last 10 minutes was all horror and action, but it wasn't enough to salvage the movies a whole. I actually considered leaving the theater.

The casting was good, and the acting was on point. The story had potential, but somehow didn't ever create that feeling of fear or dread. I knew the twist about 20 minutes into the movie so it felt more like a marathon to get there.

A catholic horror masterpiece,"""The First Omen"" emerges as a tour de force, masterfully recreating a 1970s film. It's not merely set in the era but feels as if it was crafted then, with meticulous attention to the atmospheric tone, pacing, and a certain enigmatic quality that defined the genre. The film delves into the rich tapestry of Catholic horror, a subgenre that naturally lends itself to a profound exploration of good versus evil, replete with rituals and iconography that resonate with authenticity. ""The First Omen"" transcends its predecessors, weaving together the best elements of classics like ""The Exorcist"" and ""Rosemary's Baby,"" while innovating with an undercurrent of sexual tension and repression that elevates the narrative. This film is not just a homage to the golden age of horror but a redefinition, setting a new benchmark for the genre.",8.0,13 April 2024

One of the best horror films since the 70s/80s!,"This is less of a review and more of me just sharing my opinion. I'll purposefully keep it vague, as I believe the movie should be experienced with as little prior knowledge as possible for it to work as intended.

I was really impressed with how well this turned out as a prequel, a modern movie, and a modern horror movie at that. I fully expected it to be awful, filled with the cheap tricks of modern horror like constant jump scares and scenes designed solely to provoke a reaction and sell tickets. Instead, ""The First Omen"" avoids these pitfalls and delivers a well-crafted film with a strong story that builds up slowly but steadily, ultimately resulting in a satisfying conclusion. This conclusion not only paves the way nicely to the original ""Omen"" but also potentially leaves room for new modern installments.

The visuals, audio, and soundtrack fit the movie perfectly, and the acting was superb!

In many ways, it reminded me of ""Rosemary's Baby,"" which is a big plus in my book since it's probably the best horror movie ever made.

The movie has the type of slow burn, or should I say build-up, that is very reminiscent of horror movies from the '70s and '80s. I found this very enjoyable as it managed to build up terror and discomfort in the same way that all the good oldies did. Instead of bombarding you with awful jump scares and tired horror tropes, ""The First Omen"" stands out as a refreshing throwback to classic horror, a worthy prequel, and a movie that respects and uses its source material very well.

I'd probably rate this as one of my top 3 horror movies of the millennium.",9.0,1 June 2024
Terrible hatchet job retcons the Omen,"Whatever hack made this utterly predictable for 2024 Omen prequel should be ashamed of themselves for being so talentless, yet thinking they could rewrite a classic movie and story made by people more talented and original than themselves.

First of stylistically this is yet another lame homage based movie that tries to put a slick new generic appearance on a classic horror franchise name and thinks sticking a few shots reminiscent of its predecessor somehow makes it more artistic or prestigious.

Second the story - a lame retcon in which the church is of course actually evil (not you know, the Devil like the entire series has been about) and possible for the anti christ for some reason. Oh and the cool story about Damien's mother being a jackal? That's been changed too.

Absolute hack work.",1.0,5 April 2024
Atmospheric and gripping horror!,"I've never seen any of the other Omen films so I can't speak to how well this film honours or connects to them. But what I can say is that viewing this as a standalone horror it is atmospheric, creepy, and has a thoroughly intriguing and well executed plot.

It follows Margaret, a nun plagued by terrible visions who is transferred to Rome, where sinister events begin to arouse her suspicions of an insidious conspiracy at the heart of the church.

From a story perspective it isn't overly complex, but I think that's a really positive thing. I've seen too many horror films lately that try to overcomplicate their plotting, but The First Omen keeps it relatively simple and to great effect. I do think the pacing is a little saggy and a two hour runtime is a bit uncalled for, but largely it keeps a good momentum.

There is a great atmosphere that hangs over the film, primarily injected through the score which is superb. This extends to the visuals as well, with a retro effect applied as if it were shot on film, giving it a really rich feel. At times the film falls back on cheap jump scares to illicit it's scares, and these are all very telegraphed, but largely the horror is well earned through the creepy atmosphere.

Then there's the body horror which again is really solid. This won't be one for the squeamish as it doesn't shy away from the gore at all. But thankfully it doesn't feel that gratuitous which is a nice change. It all serves the story which gives it even more impact.

So, in a world that has seen plenty of iconic horror franchises dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century (Halloween, The Exorcist, The Evil Dead etc), The First Omen surely stands out maybe the finest example of how to execute a franchise revival (although I did rather enjoy Evil Dead Rise for the record).",8.0,11 April 2024
Not David Seltzer Omen material,"Judging by the reviews here, it can be seen the audience does not know the source material.

I can't let go, but change the story just to make it seem more inclusive for a modern audience is terrible write a screenplay with real inclusive material and put another name. Changing what David Seltzer wrote almost 50 years ago just in the name of profit is a sacrilege. In the first movie if all the characters names was changed you still would know what movie is, in this one change the names and maybe you would assume an omen based movie not part of the francise, this is no Omen material its just a way rip money out of fans.",5.0,11 April 2024
The First Omen gets under your skin in all the best ways,"Most people had little to no expectations for this, but there were two things for me that signaled this might be something special: 1) the involvement of Nell Tiger Free and 2) one of the best teaser trailers in recent memory (the one with ""If I Had a Heart""). So this movie has been on my radar, and I was happy to hear it get great word of mouth despite a late embargo drop.

I'm a newbie when it comes to horror, but my interest was so strong it actually got me out to a theater to watch it myself. The film is permeated with a never-ending sense of dread and anchored by a strong performance by Free who is pitch perfect. It's a gorgeous movie with incredible locations and sets, shot beautifully by Aaron Morton. The sound and score also deserve much praise for creating an unnerving sense to each scene.

The childbirth sequences are horrifying, but the most haunting image for me was in a dark room where something approaches out of the shadows. It's a movie that hasn't left my mind since it ended.

The lead actress was mind-blowing. The intertwined lore was so respectful. It felt like those involved had a genuine love and respect for the original material.

fantastic legacy prequel,"The review you're about to read is backed up by hours of painstaking research (watching a few related movies), enjoy. The miracle of life can be a messy business, especially when it involves the antichrist. THE FIRST OMEN is a legacy prequel to THE OMEN, which I actually just saw for the first time, even though it came out almost 50 years ago. It is the feature-length directorial debut of Arkasha Stevenson. It tells the all too familiar story of Margaret (Nell Tiger Free), an American devout woman on her way of becoming a nun in 1971, 5 years before the events of THE OMEN. Working in an orphanage in Rome amidst the protesters and rioters of the time, things immediately feel off. This has a great sense of atmosphere throughout. Unease with a splash of paranoia, delicious. The pace is great, slowly building the tension then turning on the nitrous to go dangerously fast. It doesn't rely on jump-scares too much, which is so refreshing! There are some very grotesque and memorable scenes here, which could haunt my nightmares, if I had any. I could say that THE FIRST OMEN and IMMACULATE are two halves of the same holy coin, with THE FIRST OMEN being only slightly better. Nell's performance is nothing short of spectacular. She has to go to so many different places, physically and emotionally. Seeing this movie inspired me to finally watch the original trilogy, as well as ROSEMARY'S BABY, witch has a similar theme. This made me appreciate the references to the original and just how well it connects the two. I'd imagine it's very hard to make a great prequel, having things to bring in fans of the original, while having the movie stand on its own. As you can tell, I really enjoyed THE FIRST OMEN. I highly recommend it, especially if you're an OMEN fan. Remember, ""this is all for you.""",8.0,15 April 2024
Dumbest semi-religious drivel,"This is a dumb film on every conceivable level. Not because of the acting; Most of them did a really good job. The cinematography was also adequate, mostly.

The themes of this movie have been done to death, as it's a sequel/prequel/dingleberry-equal to the original 'The Omen' films.

The directing and filming is an absolute mess. No remotely sane or sober individual would ever be able to piece together what's going on in the film's final sequences. It's just a mess hidden within pretentious innuendo until the story all but fades into nothingness...

This film is not even remotely entertaining, save for its attractive and surprisingly talented actresses.",4.0,28 May 2024
Tribute to the Original Omen + Italian 70s Cinema,,8.0,30 May 2024
Might be the most disrespectfully uninspired movie I've ever seen,"I have not HATED a movie this much in YEARS.

I'm not sure I've ever felt more misled by hype. Albeit the content itself feeling potentially cliche, the trailer was so tasteful in a visual regard that I felt the movie might deserve a watch. But it was the immense hype on Twitter that's been pushed into my feed the last couple days that made me believe it would truly be something special. That assessment could not be more wrong.

First, I will acknowledge the movie's few strengths. Shot on location in Italy, many of the environments are relatively gorgeous. The costumes and set design are well done. And I found that the cinematography was very tasteful, and most of the lighting and color grading looked very nice. But the positives END THERE...

First and foremost, if you have a hollow script and hollow characters, it is very rare that any other elements will redeem your film. NONE of these characters have ANY depth or actual personality, with the exception of maybe Maria Caballero, the only actress who gets the chance to bring even the slightest bit of charisma to this film, even if its on the most base level. Thus, by default, the majority of the dialogue is a slog to sit through, as it mostly consists of basic exposition, and stale exchanges. Around the half hour mark, I began wondering if I should leave and get my money back, but I decided to hold out and give it a chance. Now, I can say that that was a mistake. It's been quite a while since I sat through an entire movie in which I could not wait for it to be over.

Through the first half, it was floating around a 5 out of 10 for me, but as it carried on, it kept giving me more and more reasons to despise it. I must say that it's greatest offense is that it features hardly a SPECK of originality. This is one of the most uninspired movies I have ever seen. Clearly the director chose some very excellent classic horror movies to rip off, but the problem is that outside of it's VERY blatant rip offs, it has no personality of its own. The only memorable scenes in the entire film are clear lifts from other iconic moments. The most memorable death sequence in the first half begins with a nod to the original Omen then attempts to take the original Suspiria's most iconic death scene and ""up the ante"" - while it is probably the coolest scene in the entire film, seeing how uninspired the rest of the film was afterwards makes me look back on it with the sourest taste in my mouth.

On the subject of SUSPIRIA, much of the music score was a direct lift of cues from Goblin's iconic Suspiria score. This director very much seemed to be a fan of Argento's legacy, as he seemed to cast a girl who very much resembled young Asia Argento as seen in Dario-produced films like The Church. And noting The Church, another one of this film's ""primary horror sequences"" was a direct ripoff of a scene in that! But WORST OF ALL.... WORST OF ALL.... was the BLATANT ripoff of the greatest scene of all time, Isabelle Adjani's subway breakdown in Possession. When THAT happened, this film created an eternal grudge with me, and I will never forgive it. It is VERY obvious that the director had lead actress Nell Tiger Free study the scene and try her best to replicate it EXACTLY. ALL of the details were ripped off - there was nothing subtle about it. It was PAINFUL to watch. To see THAT, the most legendary horror sequence of all time, ripped off to a T in a movie this vacant of any merit or inspiration, enraged me to my core. Who let this happen? I have never hated a scene in a movie so much in my life.

I had read a lot of hype about how stellar lead actress Nell Tiger Free's performance was, as well. While she gives a respectable effort, this script is honestly not giving her much to work with. The movie is actually mostly plotless and there's not a lot of legit connection from one sequence to the next. Because of this, the tension never really gets built up at all. And, I felt what the ""big plot twist"" was gonna be about halfway through the movie.

Uninspired, vapid, and straight up disrespectful to the classics, I am gonna go ahead and say this is one of my least favorite horror movies of all time. I was really hoping that this would be a solid year for American horror films. American horror films have primarily been garbage for the majority of this century. We NEED a revolution. That's what I want this year. I was hoping this would help to kick things off, but this is the epitome of the type of insincere, uncreative carbon copy garbage that has made horror the worst genre in American movies for the last 20 years. When will it end?",2.0,6 April 2024
Dark Secrets,When I first found out about this movie I had a huge problem with it because I heard they changed Damien's mother into a human rather than a jackal I don't think you should change something that has already been established But if I'm being honest I definitely formed a biased opinion and I didn't think I would like it at all Without getting into a lot of spoilers there was hints and suggestions the woman may not have been completely human and the father was the jackal I think they could have done a much better explanation of how this would be possible But I overall I can deal with the changes There is one scene that is a complete ripoff from the original Omen I was a little pissy about that But I liked the spin they put on it I don't know at the end of the day I'm just a movie fan go watch it and judge for yourself It's better than what I thought it would be.,8.0,31 May 2024
The First Omen,,3.0,18 April 2024
"Terrifying, Creepy and Plot Twists.","In the past two weeks, two horror movies have been released in America, focusing on young American nuns arriving in Italy to discover a sinister plan by a demonic faction of the Catholic Church to impregnate women. The first movie, The First Omen, is a prequel to Richard Donner's 1976 classic, The Omen, about an American couple who secretly adopt their son as the child of Satan. Wes Craven, a renowned filmmaker, emphasized that the horror genre began providing images of torture around the time the real world became filled with such images. The First Omen, directed by Arkasha Stevenson, incorporates what's happening in society at large into its genre tale of creepy occurrences behind cloistered walls. In 1971, Rome is seized by protests, and young novitiate Margaret Daino (Nell Tiger Free) asks her mentor, Cardinal Lawrence (Bill Nighy), about the turmoil. He explains that the Church is among those institutions where these young people have lost trust and faith.

The film cuts between the chaos in the streets and the chaos in Margaret's mind. She becomes intrigued by Carlita Skianna (Nicole Sorace), one of the girls at the orphanage where she serves. Carlita is quiet, odd, and unable to play with others, and the nuns often send her to ""the Bad Room,"" a sort of solitary confinement for unruly girls. Margaret sees something of herself in the girl and tries to forge a bond with her. When a rogue priest (Ralph Ineson) warns her that Carlita might be marked with the sign of the Beast, and that she might have been bred by the Church specifically to give birth to the Anti-Christ, Margaret is in denial. The First Omen is a horror film that explores the concept of loss of control and helplessness. The priest, who receives information about the Omen, is revealed in a gruesome opening scene featuring Charles Dance. The film is a mix of horror and science fiction, with images that are both textured and shocking, tapping into visceral fears. The film features black veils, monstrous figures, and grimy claws pawing at delicate female flesh. The film also features drawings on walls whispering dark nothings and black habits hanging on hooks that come to life with a burst of wind and a queasy glance. The film is a true horror film that leaves the audience with more questions than answers, highlighting the need for an active horror franchise.",10.0,1 June 2024
Worse Than Exorcist Believers (Almost),"This movie is slow, boring, not scary and dumb. It borrows blatantly from the ORIGINAL Omen but lacks the atmosphere, intelligence and story telling. There is also an incredibly overused wailing lady voice soundbite that will quickly become annoying as HELL as the movie goes on. Do yourself a favour and skip this and watch the original (even the trilogy would be a better watch than this).

Beyond that the acting is alright, nothing spectacular. Hey, by the way, did you know that chimpanzees make and use tools? The create spears and hunt monkeys and squirrels with them. That kind of makes them primitive people, don't you think? Maybe we outta stop killing them.",2.0,30 May 2024
TheFirstOmen,"#TheFirstOmen .

. I haven't watched any of THE OMEN movies, and THE FIRST OMEN is my first one and I loved it.

Perfect slow-burn horror with excellent tension buildup. The score, atmospheric horror, and unsettling moments are all great, and Nell Tiger Free's acting is outstanding.

666 An exciting, tense psychological horror that lasts two hours, unlike horror films

In Rome in the 71s, as people turned away from the faith, the Church of Vizzardelli was forced to bring in the ""Antichrist"" and control him, in order to bring people back to their faith.

The acting, music, direction, and photography are as if you were watching a movie from the 70s.",8.0,30 May 2024
this movie was so bad it was a torture to endure until the ending,"I just left the theater and i can't believe i endured to stay until the end of this movie. It was that bad.

Sadly this movie used the legend title of the great 70s omen flick and they advertised it as a prequel to the 1976 original film.

Sadly this prequel was nowhere near the great original trilogy.

They made it the wrong way.

U can't make a real horror film like that.

They used everything wrong.

The scenario was atrocius.

Give me a break here. So the bad priests want to revive the devil cause ordinary people turn away from the church ? In the 70s that is ?

Jesus christ.

And those beeps who thought of that are getting paid for this ?

As for the rest the film failed in everything.

First 30 minutes were boring as hell.

The rest were clishe jump scares.

U can't frighten people all the time using those beep clishes.

So the nun stands alone and suddenly someone touch her and she screams.

Wow what a bull.

And we use fire and inner voices beep they ruined the movie.

The only good thing in the movie was the final scene in which we saw the man who took little damien in his care in the 1976 film so there was a connection but sadly this did not saved the film.

Really now avoid this at all costs.

They don't make them like they used to do in the 70s and the 80s.

First they destroyed the exorcist series with that beep believer film and now they do the same with the omen franchise.",1.0,13 April 2024
"""How do you control people who no longer believe? You create something to fear.""","Between The First Omen and the Sydney Sweeney vehicle Immaculate, 2024 is the lucky year for anyone who happens to really dig neo-nunsploitation horror films that partly function as a commentary on anti-choice dystopia.

Despite my adoration of Sweeney's performance (mainly near the film's finale), I think The First Omen is the superior film -- not only because it leans harder into both the nunsploitation camp and the psychological Rosemary's Baby-esque side, but because it is consistently disturbing, yet beautifully so. I also think the themes are delivered with more tact and confidence; it's really no surprise that both films are celebrated as being ""necessary"" post-Roe v. Wade masterworks. (Immaculate deserves extra cred for upsetting more right-wingers and Catholics though, largely due to how it ""took"" Sweeney from them.)

The First Omen, if you hadn't figured, is a prequel to Richard Donner's Omen from 1976. I haven't seen that movie myself and as sacrilege as this may sound, I actively chose to see this movie first to see if it works by itself and makes sense to an outsider. And apart from a vaguely ""Member Berry""-ish namedrop at the end, I'd say The First Omen stands more than fine on its own.

From the moment it starts, its cinematography, staging, and editing are worthy of the classics -- encapsulating the beauty of 1970s cinema in just a few minutes, to paraphrase a commenter -- and this is only the beginning of the film's thoughtful homages. To be clear, these aren't just facile invocations on Arkasha Stevenson's part. There is a scene later that recalls the iconic breakdown sequence from Andrzej Zulawski's Possession (1981), but it's expanded upon in ways I shan't unveil here.

Right after that prologue -- that shot of stain-glass window shattering in slow-motion -- the film takes on an ominous energy that never lets up, even during ostensible moments of levity. There are countless other striking images and inspired bits of cinematography, like when the main character awakens from a drunken stupor in a shot that, on top of resembling some sort of old painting, shows her hair laid out like a spider's web holding her head in place. Note that the shot immediately preceding it is of a spider. There are, fittingly, omens throughout the picture.

The acting is utterly spectacular. Nell Tiger Free, playing an American Catholic woman sent to Rome to be confirmed as a nun, is destined for the Scream Queen Hall of Fame and Ralph Ineson's booming voice adds weight and urgency to his fearful warnings of what the Church is up to.

Mark Korven's music is also brilliant. It, too, makes us feel as though we are truly watching a movie from the '70s, albeit with more advanced special effects that, without giving too much away, caused the film to nearly get slapped with an NC-17 rating.

What holds the movie back a little bit is that it has a few weak supporting performances and, more importantly, it fails to resist jump scares -- which I concede can work fine and leave an impact, but The First Omen has a few of the fakeout variety.",8.0,2 June 2024
Would have been more entertaining with comedy music,"Always a risk to prequel an existing classic, and this was also released soon after Immaculate (could equally have been called Immaculate 2 - Losing of the Plot).

If this film had comedy music in the background, it would have been far more entertaining. Whilst some heavyweight actors (C. Dance, B. Nighy) are in this, don't be fooled, it barely reaches B film. Full of Antichrist tropes (and tripes) I was alternatively bored and having to stifle laughter. Far more terrifying was how much popcorn the two ladies along the row from me managed to eat during the film.

Just don't. There are worse films, but they really shouldn't have bothered.",2.0,11 April 2024
Prequel done right,"The problem with many prequel movies is that you are always aware how the story will eventually play-out. The First Omen does what a lot of prequels fail to do, as it intices the viewers in to the point that you forget there is a whole movie franchise behind this story.

It delivers on so many levels. It doesn't rely on modern day jump-scares, and instead builds up a creepy and sinister story over the space of two hours. Likewise, the story telling and cinematography are an ode to the traditional 1970s style of horror film many fans of the genre are used to.

While it is not a star-studded cast, despite the sporadic appearances of British acting stalwart Bill Nighy, all eyes are rightly fixated on the phenomenal acting performance of Nell Tiger Free. Seemingly carrying the movie in parts, Nell's stellar portrayal of this troubled nun-to-be has cemented herself as a 'one-to-watch-out-for' in the future.

Combining the fine acting, raw cinematography, and gripping story, The First Omen provides viewers with a sharp overview of the Omen origin story and ties nicely into the overall franchise.",8.0,15 April 2024
The most terrifying film of the year? No. Not this year or any year. This film was blah...,,2.0,5 April 2024
Refreshing an overdone storyline,"Loved this. It's a horror film for horror fans, and not necessarily fans of The Omen either. There are elements of so many different horror films in here and yet the scenes are memorable and new. There are a few stand out great scenes I will remember.

It's a fab refresh of what has become an outdated and clichéd storyline and that is because, above all, it is tongue in cheek and amps up the ludicrous elements so it is darkly funny. I was smiling the whole way through - it is right up my street!

The effects are all practical (until the beast scene at the very end) as well which I always congratulate a film on. The effort is much appreciated when CGI is minimal.

It is true that it isn't a very scary film. There are creepy moments but overall the horror is in the graphic nature of the scenes as opposed to how spooky it is. But I wouldn't call The Omen scary as a franchise anyway, you get what you expect from it in those terms.",8.0,5 April 2024
TRASH,"This movie is slow, very slow! This film is disrespectful to the original film and to the people who wasted there time watching this crap! Please remove this film from the horror Genre & just add it to the trash! When You see an iconic name name like The Omen you expect an iconic effort into making a great movie and not just a giant disappointment milking profit from a name! I would literally rather watch Scarecrow or even The Blair Disappointment Project then this garbage! You literally disrespected the horror Genre on this one! The Original Omen, Amityville & of course The OG Excorcist will always be a go to other then this new Omen.",2.0,31 May 2024
Flawless Genius,The cast.. The script.. The cinematography..the soundtrack.. The costumes.. The fx... Absolutely flawless. The fact that it makes me want to go back and watch all the other omens is a testament to its brilliance. This film is a chilling masterpiece. The acting is amazing.. Just wow.. You know that expression..they don't make them like they used to? Well take that!! To the face!! This is a beautiful homage to the classic styles and is as good as horror ever was and elevates the genre. This has inspired me to write my first review ever. Hats off to all involved. Thank you for this incredible movie.,10.0,1 June 2024
disrespectful and GROSS,"This was actually so awful. Even if this movie was disrespectful and demonic, the plot was uninteresting and didn't make much sense. Was just a demonic anti-christian movie with not even a good ending. You could've at LEAST had a good ending that didn't lead to a demonic world. This is rated R but oh my, I think i almost threw up a good 4 times. This was disgusting and could barely watch. Not even because of horror, but because of the disrespectful and disgusting message it was giving about the church. I didn't even know this movie was going to be like this but I felt like I need to leave. I feel as if I need to read the bible 4 times and pray the rosary 10 times. Thx for that.",1.0,7 April 2024
Good movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. I never watched a horror movie that was this good as this one, it was really different than normal horror movies. The plot and The storyline were perfect. Loved everything about this movie tbh. I hope there is gonna be a part 2 because the ending really surprised me!! Overall you should watch this movie.

Paranoia and Suspense: ""The First Omen"" is a paranoid thriller akin to ""Rosemary's Baby."" As the plot unfolds, you'll find yourself questioning everyone's motives.

Gory and Intense: The film doesn't shy away from gore. It's intense, and the visceral scenes will stay with you.

The Antichrist's Origin: The movie answers the question: How did Damien become the Antichrist? It's a compelling exploration of evil's genesis.",10.0,20 April 2024
These 10 star reviews can't be real....,"This is a dumb horror movie for very dumb people. Damien's mother was a jackal, right? Remember that fantastic reveal scene in the cemetery in the original? Don't be dumb, she was a human impregnated by Satan according to this dumpster fire of a film. Rosemary's Baby this isn't. If you're going to make an awful prequel to a classic horror movie perhaps know the source material. Or if you're going to butcher the story of a classic horror movie at least make it interesting with decent gore and payoff. First Omen is a slog of boredom, lame jump scares and characters, and plot ""twists"" (I use that term very loosely) you see coming a mile away. Trash on every level.",2.0,14 April 2024
Best addition to the Omen franchise yet,"Excellent addition to the franchise, finally.

After the first 3 Omen films (and, admittedly, the Final Conflict was already grating on cheese), the attempts to build a sequel or reboot the franchise were duds. But this gem then arrives.

It felt like the filmmakers really made an effort to set each scene apart, and give it extra relish. There wasn't a moment in the film where I thought they were going through the paces, rather, each scene seemed quite well thought out.

It's sad that the box office receipts don't look stellar, but Arkasha Stevenson definitely deserves another Omen film, or, heck any other horror film. She is quite a talent. Nell Tiger Free and Ishtar Currie-Wilson shine here. Tiger Free pulls the role off, and Currie-Wilson is genuinely spooky and unnerving.

Maybe they could try their hand at a true sequel?",9.0,2 June 2024
This is most stupidest and not scary but disgusting horror movie I have ever seen,"Please don't make horror movies if you don't want to make. This is nothing but just disgusting and not at all scary. Such a stupid movie, plot and acting. There.is no theme and no story in this movie or history. Just disgusting and gory. You need to understand what is horror and what is disgusting means. I think Hollywood needs to study and research a lot to make horror movie or thriller because seemingly you are losing the touch of it. If you don't know maybe try studying from Asian countries. Because this movie is utterly stupid movie to watch. I am sorry but being horror movie fan, it easy to understand what is good and horrible.",1.0,30 May 2024
Finally,Finally it's been made clear why the church was involved from the beginning. What a fantastic movie. Now we need a movie to show us what happens to Margaret and her daughter. Only question is when they opened the grave of Damien's supposed mother it was a jackal? That's a monkey wrench. I loved this movie so much. I highly recommend it. Especially if you want to watch the rest of the other Omen movies. That way you know whats whats. But the newer Omen movie with Leiv Schreiber was better than the original with Gregory Peck. Now they should remake the rest to bring them up to what we would expect.,10.0,1 June 2024
an underwhelming prequel that failed to capitalize on its potential.,"What's great about the 1976 original is that it ends leaving audiences wanting to know more about Damien's origins. Part of that intrigue is in knowing who Damien's birth mother was as a person and her experiences prior to giving birth. This prequel created some interest as fans felt they would finally get those questions answered.

While this prequel does give audiences those answers it was not a satisfying film. The film focused too much on trying to tie in a twist ending that it failed at creating interesting characters. Sister Anjelica (Ishtar Currie-Wilson) was the only character that was actually creepy with an eerie look but her role was very minimal. Father Brennan (Ralph Ineson) was another character that deserved more screen time. He was able to capture the essence of Father Brennan from the original film. Margaret (Nell Tiger Free) was not a character that demanded attention. She was a very boring character to follow, as was Carlita (Nicole Sorace).

There were references to the original which helped tie this film to that one.

There was even one scene that replicates a death from the 1976 film but it came off as lazy and unoriginal. There was however another death involving a car that was pleasing. The explanation for what is going on in the church was okay but it didn't deliver any excitement or thrills. In the end, this was an underwhelming prequel that failed to capitalize on its potential.",2.0,10 April 2024
Ufffff that was fun ride,"First of all, great story line. The environment is creepy, all the people are creepy and mysterious. People keep comparing Horrors from 60-90s that it's not even close to original blah blah. Original horrors were only scary or creepy for their times. You watch the classics now, it's just like another horror. The only reason classics are considered great because they were the originals ones.

Ok now to back to this movie. I loved it, I just wish I set even better mood and creepier vibes at home or went to movies. It has jump scares, not too many but they can get you, if you're fully indulged in the movie. Story is excellent with creepy characters and sound effects are excellent. All the Omens are great to me and this was different.",10.0,4 June 2024
Horrible Movie,"Words fail to capture the sheer disappointment that was this movie. To call it a cinematic disaster would be an understatement. From start to finish, it was an agonizing experience that left me questioning the very concept of storytelling in film.

Let's start with the plot, or lack thereof. It was as if the writers threw darts at a board filled with clichés and assembled them into a narrative. There was no coherence, no depth, just a mishmash of poorly executed ideas. Characters stumbled through scenes without purpose, their motivations as murky as a swamp at midnight. Any semblance of character development was drowned out by the cacophony of nonsensical dialogue and forced interactions.

And then there's the ending - or should I say, the lack of one. It was as if the filmmakers suddenly realized they had run out of film (or perhaps, more accurately, run out of ideas) and decided to wrap things up with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Loose ends dangled like forgotten cobwebs, leaving viewers with more questions than answers. It was a slap in the face to anyone who had invested their time and money into this cinematic train wreck.

But it wasn't just the plot that faltered; every aspect of the movie seemed to conspire against itself. The acting was wooden, as if the cast had been plucked from a community theater production on a slow Tuesday night. Dialogue delivery was stilted, with lines delivered as if the actors were reading from cue cards held just out of frame. There was no chemistry between characters, no spark to ignite even the most basic of on-screen relationships.

Even the technical aspects of the film were lackluster. The cinematography was bland and uninspired, with shots that lingered far too long on mundane details while crucial plot points whizzed by in a blur. The editing was choppy, with scenes that seemed to have been stitched together with all the finesse of a kindergarten art project. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack - a forgettable mess of generic tunes that did nothing to enhance the viewing experience.

In the end, watching this movie felt like a waste of both time and money. It was a soul-crushing reminder of just how bad cinema can be when it falls into the wrong hands. I left the theater feeling drained and disillusioned, mourning the lost hours that I would never get back. If you're considering seeing this film, do yourself a favor and save your sanity - and your wallet - for something worth your while.",1.0,10 April 2024
How to make a prequel without insulting fans,"Every time Hollywood does it usual shtick... unwanted sequels and prequels... fans bow their heads in shame... but for once, all things worked in favour in this production and we finally have gotten a worthy prequel.

Does it have it flaws... yes, but nothing to dramatic as to sink this movie. The script, direction, acting and the way they captured Italy on screen is just well done. And thank god they went without throwing cheap jump scares every few minutes.. but instead showed us beautiful yet haunting images with a brilliant score to highlight the dread and sense of impending doom. All in all a great movie which can stand proudly next to the original The Omen movie.",9.0,1 June 2024
Nothing special,"The acting was good, nothing wrong with that. The problem I have with this movie is that in no way it connects to the viewer. It isn't scary nor does it keep you hostage to watch the whole thing in one go. I watched it in parts because it wasn't captivating enough.

Everything about this movies makes you think they were searching to exploit the original 3 movies. It's disappointing to be honest.

The worst thing about it all is the touch the actors should have with their role. Like you have to be the person you play. But no actor in this movie was able to do that job.

Back to the drawing board and make something really scary!",5.0,9 June 2024
Pleasantly Surprised,"The content mentioned below is worth consideration: It is worth watching. There is no risk in watching this on Hulu. It is a perfect tie-in prequel to the original. I have not seen any of the sequels for various reasons, as I have lived through decades of horror sequels that are flat-out all-shock and have no substance, but this is a great time.

The undertones of dread are ever present, even if you can guess the final sequence. There is a good mix of outside shots and Closter-phobic scenes. The movie has a good pace without making rushed decisions or generic jump scares. Nell brings the same energy she had for M Night's Servant (also a great show)",9.0,31 May 2024
"Garbage. Everything, everywhere, bad. All at once.","This movie is awful. The writing is bad, the acting is atrocious. The director should never work again. Unless it's bad educational films, that would work. Seems written by AI. Terrible acting choices. The music was awful and almost painful to the ears. Tons of laughs though. I'm the idiot for paying to see this trash but it really is awful. The best scene was for sure the birth scenes. The hand coming out of the woman was great. The old 70s Italy setting was cool I guess. I hated so many of the choices made in this movie. I almost question my sanity after reading other reviews raving about garbage.",1.0,7 April 2024
Nuns are scarier than clowns!,"I remember watching The Omen as a young teenager. Most likely at my friend, Kelly's house because they were the first family to get a VHS player. (Yes, I just aged myself). I remember that it was creepy. I remember the way I felt about seeing an evil child (A new concept to me at that time). I mean, kids are angelic, not the spawn of the devil himself, right? But, that's about all I remember about it. Your standard mid seventies horror flick. Certainly not as good as the Exorcist, but scary enough to remember.

Fast forward to last night. I'm a tinge older and still a fan of horror movies, so I was really looking forward to seeing this new addition to a spooky old favorite. The first thing that struck me about this film was the staggering music. I know that scores to films are imperative to setting the mood of the film, but this was different. The music was delightfully disturbing and mind blowing. It was uncomfortable and made me feel like I needed some sage or a blessing or two. Absolutely brilliant!! The film brought us to some of the most mesmerizing and hauntingly beautiful places. Rome is historic, stunning and mysterious and to see it through the eyes of the main character, Margaret, was amazing. In my opinion, the acting was great! Each character played out so well on the screen and added so much to, not only the creep factor, but also to the like ability, or disdain felt, for all of the prominent characters. The storyline was well written and played out with some predictability, but for the most part, I was left wondering until the very end. I will also make the following bold statement... NUNS are more terrifying than CLOWNS....hands down!!! Just try to change my mind. The subtle scares mixed so sweetly with the jump scares, giving me the adrenaline fix I was seeking. I won't mention the scene that had me feeling completely stressed and way more uncomfortable than I thought I would be, as I want you (if you are into these types of films) to experience it for yourself. Long story short...I highly recommend this film horror enthusiasts!",8.0,5 April 2024
Very average,"The First Omen is one of those films that you sit back and wait for the twist and the cliffhanger. Unfortunately, the audience will know both of these far ahead of time. The journey getting to the third act stumbles along with random acts of confusion where not much seems to really happen.

Positively speaking, the direction and acting are both very good and work well together when there's scenes that focus on Nell Tiger Free and her internal struggle to figure out what is happening with all the characters that surround her. Unfortunately, it's when we start branching out with other characters and deepening the plot that the plot becomes muddy. Scenes stand out as being visually enthralling, but underneath the stylistic aspects of the storytelling, I couldn't help but to question everything that happens in the second half. And these questions come about not because I missed a line of dialogue, but because things happen that are irrational.

A tighter script, more horror, and a true twist would really set this apart from the genre. It can't stand up against the first film nor other horror movies that are coming out in 2024 simply because it doesn't add up as being scary, being smart, or being fun.",5.0,6 April 2024
A Hell of a Prequel,"Jumping into *The First Omen*, I expected some standard spook-fest fare, but what I got was a prequel that practically reinvents the wheel - if that wheel were crafted in the deepest pits of hell and rolled uphill both ways. Director Arkasha Stevenson turns the creepiness dial past the usual horror benchmarks, planting it firmly in ""nightmare fuel"" territory. This film doesn't just haunt your dreams; it buys real estate there, builds a mansion, and throws a housewarming party.

The cast is absolutely killer - literally and figuratively. Nell Tiger Free leads with an unsettling grace that makes you wonder if she's plotting your demise or just really into her role. And the ensemble around her? They're like the Avengers if the Avengers were in the business of birthing antichrists instead of saving the world. Bill Nighy's performance is a particular standout; he delivers lines with a chill that could freeze hell over, which, in this context, might just be a plot point.

In the end, while *The First Omen* might not entirely escape the shadow of its iconic predecessor, it carves out its own dark little niche in the horror genre. Sure, it occasionally trips over its own ambition, trying a bit too hard to be ominously profound, but it's a wickedly enjoyable ride. So grab your holy water, keep a priest on speed dial, and prepare for a film that's as fun as it is frightening. Four stars for making me laugh nervously in between yelps of terror.",8.0,1 June 2024
"watch IMMACULATE instead. This is weird, unnecessary and full of plot holes","I am a huge fan of creepy horror and The (original) Omen is one of my favourites especially with its creepy-as-heck score (Ave Satani) which scares me even when I think about it.

I even enjoyed the remake of the original Omen.

However, this film was:
not as scary as the original
full of weird, meaningless and unexplained scenes
story was disjointed and unclear


I LOVED ""Immaculate"".

If anyone liked this, they must like weird shots and body horror.

I went with my family and we were mostly chuckling (to keep us from laughing and ruining everyone's mood) throughout the film. Several times we almost left but we thought meh, we might as well sit through it.

NOT FOR ME!",1.0,7 April 2024
"The BEST horror movie, this YEAR!!!","WOW..... You have to let that sink in first. It's been a long time since there has been a good horror film on the screen that doesn't use jump scares, but scares you with pure feelings and tension.

I saw the film in a preview on April 6th and I can't get it out of my head. This is partly due to the truly breathtaking Arkasha Stevenson who directed this prequel. She knew exactly what she was doing and also knew which franchise she was dealing with. And I continued to fall in love with her.

There are really so many scenes that disgust you, shock you or just really scare you and there are really no jump scares at all.

But with really good camera work and acting.

Every now and then, the camera just stops where you think after the trailer, there's going to be a jump scare, but instead you start to imagine things in that darkness that aren't even there, and that was so INTERESTING to see where you were after that For a while you always wanted more and you literally got it.

Even the script constantly screwed you over and told you something all the time so that you just didn't see the plots coming. And in my experience it really was, because at first I thought, ""Ahh, that's the plot, how lame."" and then BOOOM, came the second plot that really put you on the edge of your seat and just shocked you. But this film doesn't just have a plot twist, it also has really good character telling, the characters are explained for almost an hour and their story creates an emotional connection and in the end you feel everything and just lets you travel along emotionally. Of course, there were also characters who were simply left behind, but with whom you actually still felt very connected. But there was also one point of criticism, which is the only point in the entire film, and that was the connection between the end of the original 1976 part and the mother of this part. But otherwise it was a really good script that knew exactly what it was doing.

Among other things, the color crading is really moving, especially at the beginning, which gave you a 70s - 80s look, whatever time period this film is set in.

My conclusion about ""The First Omen"" is that it is the best horror film of this year and I don't think anyone will top it. Because it knows how to shock and scare the viewer AND do it without jump scares like the average horror film. And we can thank the breathtaking Arkasha Stevenson for that, who knew from the beginning how she was going to implement and portray this film and that was really backed up by mega good acting, which, with a good character deepening, makes the viewer shudder.",9.0,8 April 2024
If you want to laugh watch this film!!!!,,2.0,10 April 2024
Worth watching but it's so distrubing,This movie is completely worth watching. Nell tiger free was acted extraordinary and excellent performance. The movie's story is pretty good was interesting although it has not much scary scenes like nun movie but story wise it is strong movie. The camera work is also good and quality is provided. The movie's negative is there is featured a monster demon as a main character but it was shown physically as it's appears slightly not fully this may be due to lack of CGI budget. Definitely the mature scenes will disturb many audiences as there is no sexual scens but nudity is openly shown. It's like a supernatural investigation not scary movie. You must sit alone to watch due to 18+,10.0,6 June 2024
Another nun movie... if you like them then it's probably for you,"It's just another nun movie which appear to be in vogue, but it has nothing to do with the The Omen or if it does it I cannot fathom the connection.

It follows a usual formula of mini scares, max scares with a plot of kinds throw in to keep people thinking there is some internal cohesion, but it doesn't really have any of the intensity of the original movie which I believe had Gregory Peck in it.

This is the third or fourth nun movie I have seen doing the rounds in the last number of months, but most are little but teenage flicks you take your girl to. The movie for some reason tries to pull in the political situation in Italy in the 70s/80s with persistent political unrest and various terrorist organizations in full battle with the government, but for the life of me I don't see any relevance or connection with the plot.

The consistently high ratings make me wonder, am I missing something? Others can tell, I would love to see the box-office turnover for this.",3.0,5 April 2024
An Impressive Prequel that Honors the Original,"I had high expectations for ""The First Omen,"" and I am thrilled to say it exceeded them in every way. This film is a masterfully crafted prequel to the 1970s classic ""The Omen,"" and it connects to the original in a manner that is both seamless and deeply satisfying.

From the very start, the atmosphere is rich and immersive, echoing the ominous tone of its predecessor while bringing its own unique flair. The storytelling is tight, with a plot that unravels the backstory in a way that feels organic and compelling. It's clear the filmmakers have a deep respect for the original material, and they've managed to expand on the mythos without undermining it.

The performances are outstanding, particularly the lead, who brings a nuanced portrayal that anchors the film's eerie narrative. The direction is sharp, maintaining a suspenseful pace that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The cinematography and score are equally impressive, creating an atmosphere that is both haunting and beautiful.

What truly shocked me was how well ""The First Omen"" bridges to the original film. The connections are cleverly woven, offering fans of the original movie delightful moments of recognition while still standing strong as a standalone piece. It's a rare prequel that enhances the original story rather than detracts from it.

In conclusion, ""The First Omen"" is a fantastic film that honors its origins while carving out its own place in the horror genre. It's a must-watch for fans of the original and anyone who appreciates a well-done, chilling narrative.",10.0,30 May 2024

Has no place on the Omen franchise,"Poorly written and poorly executed.

This movie attempts be part of the Omen series claiming yi be a prequel and yet it seems that the film makers have not actually seen the originals. The links are inaccurate and fail the connection, parts from the original stolen/reused and a last ditch effort to link by needing to call out character names.

This movie was an insult to the original series.


Rather than an Omen movie, it is remarkably similar to another horror ""Immaculate"".

Genuine thrills and chills!,"I will say it's a tad long and I have watched Immaculate as well. Which is very good but has some histonrics in the middle. This movie has a lovely set up with some excellent mood setting and production design. The cast is uniformly great.

I'm a UK viewer so I'm already a fan of the cast. I'm an Omen 1&2 fan so turned up for some fan service. But this movie actually stands on its own. The character building feels genuine with the seventies setting is evocatively told.

Yet it has a subtext similar to Immaculate but approached the ideas differently which could only be told with modern sensibilities.

The cinematography and 70's style of Rome was beautiful and the story telling was set at the perfect pace with an intriguing plot that kept my attention the whole time (which is rare for me). It was a pretty intense movie due to the sinister sound track, grotesqueness, and raw emotions (almost to the point that I had to step out and take a break) but all in all it was an absolute masterpiece.

I'm not going to tell the movie or anything, but there were several scenes where I actually said out loud, what the hell am I watching.

The crazy thing is for years I've talked about how horror movies are wack now, and how movies back in the day was scary with limited technology, I've even stopped watching certain horror movies because of the disappointment.

Now finally, they make this movie with a lot of thought and details, I don't know whether to be appreciative for them thinking outside of the box, and going with it, or calling 911 and pressing charges, lol.

"Not scary, nothing like the original Omen","The real ""first"" Omen from the 1970s was terrifying. I saw it as a young kid in the 90s and it gave me nightmares, especially considering my early upbringing in the church. A prequel to the original Omen might have been good, but this attempt was not. The movie was not scary AT ALL!!! It came across as more of a trippy student art film than a horror film. Also parts of the movie were so dark it was impossible to see/understand what was happening. I disagree with what one of the other commenters said about jump scares- ANY jump scares would have been better than nothing, at least it would have added some element of fear to the film. I don't understand all the positive reviews for this movie. Either people are getting paid to write these reviews or they have never seen any of the original Omens.

Major plot holes for a prequel that is unenjoyable on its own,"Very dark/different type of film with a talented lead actress, but the story/motive itself makes no sense. The story is based on the antagonists' very faulty, inaccurate theory/motive which directly conflicts itself. It's also one of the slowest burning horror films that had me wondering when the story might actually begin. There were unnecessary scenes throughout that add very little to the story and major plot holes as well.

The worst part is that unless you're aware its preexisting sequel is a film from the 1970s, viewers are left with a pointless, hopeless, bag-guys-win storyline that ends randomly and abruptly.

Garbage well filmed.,"The great horror film classics are related to the Catholic Church: The Omen, Rosemary's Baby or The Exorcist. Here we are faced with an unnecessary sequel that, despite being well filmed (my respects to whoever directed it), the story is unsustainable on all sides; the idea of presenting the antichrist as the product of a conspiracy where his unlikely protagonists are as serious as I am as a quantum scientist (I'm not). There is a priest who claims to be excommunicated but always stays in church rooms and who seems to be quite functional for the plot, a group of nuns who would not be allowed in any monastery in the world, a cardinal who does the work of a bishop and It never demonstrates the need for such a high position and a constant use of circumstances that are cliché in every film of the genre. What's more, at one point I laughed after a certain moment that involved an accident that when you see it you will know what I'm talking about. It's a movie with such a bad plot that it does little justice to the first three Omen movies (I won't tell you about the other one because, like this one, it's garbage). Here all the female characters are unpleasant and if it weren't for a bizarre ending where the devil's progeny (incestuous in a way) survive I could assure that it is difficult to overcome this crap. There is an open window to a parallel line when it comes to plot, which tells me that producers should reconsider when approaching the classics. The classics deserve respect and not garbage like this.",2.0,12 April 2024

I thought some of the scenes were a bit cheep, like when it came to the jump scares but it was because it wasn't anything new. It was a bit predictable because they took some of the jump scenes from the original story. It was like I was 5 seconds a head of the movie every time something was going to happen.

At first it seemed kind of slow and confusing but it was worth it for the bigger picture in the end. Even though its been done 4 other times before I think they did it justice.. I'll admit I hope they do a second one and I wasn't a big fan of the originals.

"""The First Omen"": A Diabolically Good Prelude!","Welcome to the eerie corridors of ""The First Omen,"" where the whispers of the past echo with a chilling clarity. As the latest entrant in the spine-tingling Omen series, this movie takes us back to the origins, offering a fresh, albeit shadowed, perspective on the tale we thought we knew. Strap in, dear reader, for a review that dares to dance with the devil in the pale moonlight!

Acting with an Unholy Grace

""The First Omen"" presents a cast that performs with such convincing terror and turmoil that you might find yourself glancing over your shoulder long after the credits roll. The actors, with their superb performances, breathe life-or should I say, a sinister breath of the afterlife-into their characters, making every scene a haunting tableau of horror.

A Symphony of Symbols

While a few plot points were perhaps a tad predictable, let's not overlook the masterful dance with the devilish details. The movie's use of symbolism isn't just a nod to the aficionados of the genre but an intricate tapestry that enhances the narrative and deepens the lore of the Omen series.

Jump Scares and Goosebumps

Yes, the movie does make you jump-perhaps not out of your skin, but certainly enough to spill your popcorn. It's a testament to the film's expertly crafted tension and timing. Whether it's the creak of a door or the sudden appearance of a sinister figure, ""The First Omen"" knows how to manipulate its audience's nerves.

For the Fans and the Uninitiated

For those who've followed the Omen series with a dedicated heart, this film is a treasure trove of revelations and insights. But fear not, newcomers! This prelude serves as a fantastic entry point into the series, offering enough context to stand alone while sparking curiosity about its successors.

Rewatchability Factor

I'm already planning to dive back into the dark world of ""The First Omen."" The impact it had on me was profound enough that I intend to rewatch the entire series in its newly established chronological order. It's a testament to the film's allure and its ability to weave new threads into the existing Omen tapestry.

The Verdict: A Hellishly Good Watch!

With a score of 4 out of 5, ""The First Omen"" is not just a movie; it's a cinematic séance that conjures the very essence of horror. Whether you're a devout follower of the series or a fresh-eyed explorer in this dark domain, this movie is a compelling invitation to delve into the shadows.

So, dear readers, if your appetite for horror is as insatiable as ours, give ""The First Omen"" a watch. Who knows? You might just find yourself under its malevolent spell, eager to uncover more dark secrets in the subsequent films.

Remember, in the world of ""The First Omen,"" every shadow tells a story, and every chill down your spine is a verse in its unholy scripture. Dare to decode it?",8.0,10 April 2024
An Ok Movie But A Bad Prequel,,4.0,3 June 2024
Very good,"Cinematography: The film opens strongly, immediately capturing attention with its use of cinematic techniques. The diversity of camera angles, including various shots from inside a car, complements the film's visual narrative. The use of medium closeups enhances the emotional intensity of the scenes.

Editing & Pace: The editing is competently executed, maintaining a slow pace that is intentional but may not reveal its purpose until later in the viewing experience. The slow-motion sequences are particularly effective, creating a palpable tension that's both engaging and innovative. This slow unveiling contributes to a sense of mystery, although it occasionally borders on creating confusion regarding plot developments.

Sound Design: The sound design is a standout feature, similar to iconic films like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Dune (2021)."" It skillfully incorporates elements such as glass and ring sounds with gospel music in a Shepard tone, alongside whispering chants and groaning that sound very rich. The soundtrack also unexpectedly mixes cinematic scores with funk and disco music, adding an original twist.

Performance: The performances are a major strength of the film. One actor, in particular, brings a notable depth to their role, especially the voice, and the main protagonist delivers her performance impressively. The cast's ability elevates the mature and well-developed script, making even predictable moments engaging.

Plot & Script: The plot is well-crafted with rich details, although it bears similarities to ""Immaculate (2024),"" which makes the structure somewhat predictable in the first two acts. However, the third act introduces unique elements that set it apart. The dialogue is sharp and contributes effectively to the development of the storyline, ensuring that each character's voice is distinct and meaningful. Hence, I prefer writing for this film than ""Immaculate"".

Special Effects: The CGI is commendable, enhancing the film's horror elements without relying too heavily on jump scares, of which there are only a few minimal instances.

My Critique: While the film excels in many technical aspects, I struggled with clarity in the first two acts, leaving too many ambiguities unexplained. Additionally, the predictable plot elements due to its similarity to ""Immaculate (2024)"" may diminish the impact for some viewers, although the film tries to go in a different direction in its final act.

Conclusion: Overall, ""The First Omen (2024)"" is a film that impresses with its technical execution and strong performances. Despite some narrative shortcomings and pacing issues, it offers a fresh take on traditional elements, making it a worthwhile watch for fans of sophisticated horror and thriller genres.

It doesn't rely on jump scares (although there are a few) instead it builds tension and has some simply wonderful cinematography and imagery, there were times, I felt I was watching a David Lynch film, bizarre, creepy and often odd I absolutely loved that it didn't feel the need to explain absolutely everything up front. T builds to a wonderful conclusion, perfectly preludes the original and best, and leaves the door open to explore the Omen universe in new exciting ways. Something I hope this director gets the opportunity to do. It's only an 8 out of 10 for me because I'm old school and was hoping for one or two more grisly deaths but that's just me.

Don't waste your time.. 120 minutes of non sense,"A real disappointed, the movie is trying too hard to scar you. The story does not make any sense at all.

The movie has gore and disgusting scenes more than pure horror or scare jumps.

People in the cinema started to leave in the middle of the movie and I regerted not to leave with them.

The acting is so bad, the music pitch is high, disturbing and does not match with the movie.

I think the aim of the movie is to show nuns as bad people who smokes, go out to have fun and get drunk. For a prequel I expected to see something similar to the conjuring. But the whole movie is a saw wanna be..

A well done prequel with great atmosphere,"This film nails the right aesthetic of the 70s.

It starts strongly building tension even if most people know what's coming.

Yes the plot has some immediate similarities to the Sydney Sweeney starring Immaculate and it's a strange coincidence both movies were released so close together but The First Omen does have its own way of doing things.

The acting is mostly excellent and Nell Tiger Free excels in her role.

Whilst I wouldn't say it's a very scary movie there's definitely some yucky bits and the ending is pretty good compared to most horrors on offer at the moment.

This comes across more of a thriller/religious drama but it moves along swiftly without much filler and is definitely worth the time to watch it.

"Unsettling and shocking, this is a prominent horror","As a prequel to The Omen that doesn't have notable sequels, The First Omen came as surprise, knowing how underdeveloped Hollywood horror prequels are. This movie knows what it wants, hugely inspired by 70's horror aesthetics (the moving zoom-in, relying on unsettling ambiences, etc.) create an amazing experience from the beginning to the end.

Much like its original work, The First Omen doesn't shy from graphic violence and jumpscares, but Stevenson as the director, knows how to use them effectively in order to thicken the mystery as the main plot. But, that's not what makes this movie amazing. The climax is a top-tier climax I've ever watch in a horror film. It's graphic, sadist, surreal, and horrifying, which I won't forget quickly. The climax also gives enough answer, but also enough unanswered questions that open for future sequel.

What keeps me from giving this film a perfect score is due to its slow pacing in the first act, which somehow disjoint the movie's pacing throughout the movie. But still, it's my personal favorite horror, even movie, of the year.",9.0,16 April 2024

I mean where does this franchise go now. Is the girl the anti-christ too, or is she the savior of mankind. I guess we will have to watch two more hours of pointless exposition to find that out. This movie was laughably bad. Rated R horror has really gone down bad🤣🤣🤣

They definitely give us a 70s movie but the only difference it was made in 2020s. A lot of scenes made me u comfortable and made me flinch which is hard to do since I'm a big horror fan.

The First Omen perfectly compliments the original The Omen and even though you may think you know where this journey is going to end up, the trip takes some very interesting twists and turns to get there.

I actually tried to have a nap half way through but the seat in the cinema was a little uncomfortable.

Like ots of modern films it suffers a little from the 'This is actually just an introduction ready for the real fun in the sequel.'.

"A ""bunch"" of stereotypes in an Oedipus Bag","When will these newfound playwrights stop copying the hackneyed, tortured, battered plot about ""devilry"" in Christian settings? At least they read books on demonic mythology or Stephen King was asked to give them an idea.

Is this kind of nonsense in demand by the audience? There is absolutely no semantic content in the film, only dirty images. None of the characters voice a philosophical idea, and in fact the theme of the film is predisposed to just such an exposition; only the convulsive absurdity of a hoax.

The main character is ""not such a"" nun, she has neither knowledge nor beliefs, and even more so she has no position, she is simply a vicious creation of a lover of stupid horror stories. The creators stretch the short film with psychedelic scenes to inflate the ""bubble"" of demonic nonsense; the actors ""climb out of their skin"" by rounding their eyes; the screenwriters ""give birth"" to a micromelic something incapable of life for the umpteenth time. The most important plot twist is concentrated in a woman's womb, there is nothing more important in the world than a female reproductive organ, well, what else can a consciousness bound by ambivalent feelings come up with: gloomy nuns, religious psychological attitudes, Satanists in robes - a whole bunch of stereotypes in an Oedipus bag.",4.0,15 April 2024
Great madness!,I saw in the last few hours and wow such a wild horror experience; some similarities to Immaculate and this is better! I like how Nell Tiger Free starred in The Servant on Apple TV that had a lot to do with babies and a fair amount of evil supernatural vibes I'd recommend that as well. Only a little annoying thing to my experience was how a couple woman laughed at terror a few times even were talking to much luckily in the 2nd half they stopped which was perfect since it was the most pivotal most epic section to the movie. An excellent satanic horror about the devils number and nuns all of which was well directed!,8.0,10 April 2024
Silly and predictable,"Firstly, the film gets points for the main star's real name, Nell Tiger Free. Great name. Actually, she was quite good and did a very good job of an American accent (listen to the YouTube interview with her). While we're still on the cast, Bill Nighy was not a good choice. It only confirmed my belief that British actors of his generation have very limited range. I like Nighy but he was still the same person as he was in WILD TARGET, MARIGOLD HOTEL, the POTTER film etc. Charles Dance, who made barely a cameo appearance, would have been better in the role.

Now to the plot. The story rattles along predictably, possibly in a hurry to set up what will inevitably be a sequel. And if you don't see the twist coming you must be stupid. The film does get points for having some stylish set pieces but was there anything truly scary? No. It's not like the EXORCIST, which to this day is STILL pretty chilling.",4.0,1 June 2024
"A stylish, wonderfully retro horror experience.","The First Omen goes incredibly hard. It's downright fantastic, chillingly effective retro, and an immensely stylish horror experience that is sure to get people talking. Nell Tiger Free is stupendous - man, she gives it her all, and Arkasha Stevenson's direction is flawless. It's one of those rare sequels/prequels that is not made for cash grab purposes or made for the sake of it. In fact, this horror affair is made with great style, panache, and real care. Even though you know how the story ends, The First Omen is a relentless thrilling experience and a near perfect entry into the Omen Franchise.

I Loved it.",8.0,10 April 2024
A thematically and cinematically superior prequel,"It does follow the basic outline formula of the original and there's not much surprise plotwise. Even the supposed twist was very obvious from the very beginning. But even the original Omen worked more with how the mystery unravels to the characters than to the audience. The clear politics of this movie is where this truly surpasses the original. The true cult-like behaviours stemming from the belief that it is right, thinking control is very much needed by everyone at every level, which as an American film also clearly parallels the control of bodily autonomy being put into force currently. The idea that the ones who are working for the evil are different and ""the others"" are abandoned shows how it's the same people who believe in both sides and those outside don't even have a side in this.

The film also retcons some stuff and ties it up to the original which may not work for everyone but by the end, I was convinced with it. The ending setting up the franchise was more like a non-horror-type franchise building but I guess it works because this and the original is more psychological mystery than horror. Although this did have a lot of gore, some of it clearly homage to the original and some on the face gore clearly sending a political message for those who can catch it.

Nell Tiger Free has a great future. This and Too Old To Die Young are proof of that and I hope Hollywood utilizes it.",8.0,10 April 2024
A bit too slow,"There are simply too many christio-centric horror movies out there. I am burned out on these and if you are going to release one, at least make my heart pump a little. This one has nothing in terms of scares. Its more of a psychological horror story about priests and nuns acting a bit shady. Then we have girls who are possessed and having psychotic breaks and hallucinations.

As is well known with this movie series, the idea is that the possessed girls are destined to birth the anti-Christ and bad events follow them around causing death and such.

We follow along wondering who the possessed mother will be. Is it that crazy girl who the movie tries to tunnel vision you into early on? Is it the promiscuous one who wants to go out partying? Is it the innocent one who gives into temptation? WHO IS IT? LoL. Honestly its all very telegraphed and you wont be shocked regardless of who it is. That's the entire movie.

Now dont get me wrong. If I werent so burned out on these types of films I may have enjoyed this a little more. I can see this being popular back in the 70s for that reason. But today there are just too many of these films and all of them are very similar with slight variation. There are no original stories any more and when you run out of stories, you need change you focus to action. This is why I found this one boring. There just isnt enough action to keep me awake. The story I have seen many times already.

All in all, not the worst movie but I found it hard to stay awake while watching it. Its hit or miss depending on your mood.",4.0,30 May 2024
This is how you compliment a legacy movie!,"The First Omen (2024)

A respected horror film from the 70s has been unearthed for a prequel? Sounds like a bad idea based on previous experiences.... however, I did find Nell Tiger Free to be great in a TV series called Servant, her presence created some sense of anticipation before entering the cinema. To my surprise, the entire film turned out to be an enjoyable experience and if you are looking for a solid horror movie, make sure to check it out.

The story takes place in 1971 Rome where a young American woman named Margaret travels to an orphanage to take care of the local children, become a proper nun and fully devote herself to God. After a short while, Margaret begins to notice a number of peculiarities and suddenly, she gets approached by a mysterious bishop who claims to know what is really going on under the facade of this seemingly pious establishment.

The First Omen is not big on the traditional jump scares we have got accustomed to; instead, it relies on creating an atmospheric horror through the use of chilling music, good acting, immersive decorations and excellent visuals. The interesting narrative kept me engaged the entire time and simultaneously allowed the fear to gradually creep in. The only distracting element was the English writing in an Italian orphanage, but that didn't ruin the experience.

I am a big enjoyer of religious choirs and here, they worked exceptionally well in combination with the film's horror aspects to elevate the overall experience. I even sat through the credits to hear every bit of the soundtrack that the movie had to offer. By the end of the film, I was filled with excitement to rewatch the original Omen and I certainly wouldn't mind seeing The Second Omen because of how everything ended.

The story and the themes it deals with, performances of the cast, direction, screenplay, soundtrack, cinematography, creepy, tense, and frightening atmosphere, ending, and the plot twist were all great and have nearly nothing to be said against them.

Regarding the flaws, the movie has some flaws, but it is not worth to concentrate on them, like the 120 minutes runtime, which from my point of view, was a little bit long, lack of scary scenes and jumpscares, and some story elements that were not so clear.

Final Destination? First stop actually,"No pun intended as always. For those who grew up with the Final Destination movies - they may not have heard of a little movie franchise that started with Omen ... or now ""restarted"" with First Omen. This mirrors (again no pun intended) some of the deaths that came after (or before depending on how you look at it) ... and in quite the interesting and really ""fun"" way.

This also serves as the ... birth of ... let's say that franchise! The movie is great visually speaking - I understand if some might have liked it if this was a bit shorter - but the director needed or rather wanted to tell the story that way ... and it works! You have to guess where it is going - I know I was surprised towards the end - well I was able to figure some stuff out ... but just before it was revealed anyway.

A so so horror film,"I've never been a fan of the Omen but I am fan of horror and consider myself somewhat of a horror connoisseur. I think this film is great for people that don't spend their time watching too many horror movies. It has plenty of spooky elements and a story that would be interesting to horror movie novices. For the seasoned horror fanatics the movie has good visuals and is well shot. The sound track and mood of the film is great but it relies on things you've seen done in plenty of other horror films. I found the movie more interesting than scary. I felt that way about the first Omen also which is why I wasn't a fan of it. I believe for me and a lot of others The Exorcists was the winner of scary religious horror films. So Omen always seemed boring in comparison.

Anyway fast forward decades later and they make this rendition of the omen which just seems to be missing that thing called suspense. There some great scenes but I never found them scary.

For me this is a good novice horror flick. The average person will enjoy it. For the seasoned horror watcher you'll most likely be bored for a majority of the film.",5.0,8 June 2024

My father showed me the 06 Omen growing up and we were terrified especially the stories he would tell along with it. Being all grown up and able to understand everything is amazing.

"Striking and well-acted, but too long-winded and predictable","""Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. Therefore we know that it is the last hour."" Unfortunately, that bible quote is scarier (depending on your own personal religious beliefs) than anything that ""The First Omen"" has to offer. But I don't want to get ahead of myself yet, so let's slowly work our way there, together.

""The First Omen"" has all the hallmarks of a great movie - notably, excellent visuals, competent acting, and slick direction (and not to mention, an attractive cast). And admittedly, when the film first started I was captivated by its look and feel. You can tell the movie is trying to lean into so-called elevated horror, and from a visual perspective, it really works; this is a pretty movie to look at, made even prettier by Nell Tiger Free in the leading role.

Nell is pretty perfect here, basically carrying the entire film on her back with a performance that is genuinely riveting and especially thought provoking if you're one who enjoys depictions of faith in film. Going through her own personal little journey of Christian belief, Nell's character is a true believer who genuinely wants to serve the Lord - and what better way to do that then in Rome? And so, the film offers you all the eye candy you could ever want from its gorgeous actors and the gorgeous setting, all carried by a strong lead performance that is arguably awards worthy. Sounds pretty good so far, right?

Unfortunately, my positives kind of end right there because, while I didn't outright dislike this movie, I can't say that I liked it either because, well, in ""The First Omen,"" not much happens - and the worst sin of all? The movie isn't scary. What is the IMDb synopsis? ""A young American woman is sent to Rome to begin a life of service to the church, but encounters a darkness that causes her to question her faith and uncovers a terrifying conspiracy that hopes to bring about the birth of evil incarnate."" With a plot descriptor like that, you may or may not be surprised to hear that this film plays out more like a Dan Brown novel than a horror film (complete with an exposition explainer of said conspiracy not once, but twice, just in case you missed the extremely obvious explanation the first time around). The movie feels like ""The Da Vinci Code"" with characters trying to unearth secrets that just don't feel very secret due to how obvious they are; when the audience knows exactly what's happening at the start and the characters are just beginning to figure it out when there's 45 minutes left in the movie, there's a problem.

A slow burn to its very core, this film takes forever to get going, which I'm not opposed to as long as the build up is, well, building up to something. And even though this movie does gradually lead viewers to a specific climax, it just doesn't feel earned or worth the wait. The movie spends over an hour setting up and knocking down its pieces; when secrets are revealed, the film really thinks that it's shocking its viewers with revelatory information... as if the plot wasn't immediately obvious from the very first scene. And so, the entire film I was waiting for something to happen that was contrary to what I already knew was going to happen - but nope! And complete with an equally as predictable ending, when the credits rolled I audibly uttered, ""That's it?""

""The First Omen"" is beautiful, and unfortunately, that's all it is. With an extremely predictable plot and a pacing that's too slow for its own good - all leading to an anticlimactic and underwhelming ending, this movie disappointed me. There is a chance I'd watch it again one day due to its striking visuals and great performances, but when you release a horror movie as un-horrifying and as predictable as this one is, it's worth asking yourself if the viewing experience is even worth it in the first place.",5.0,19 April 2024

Oh That Church is Always Up to Something,"To begin with I had very low expectations of ""The First Omen,"" the latest devil spawn of The Omen franchise. That said, I was very pleasantly surprised at this prequel. It begins with a novitiate (never thought I'd use that word!) sent over to Rome to learn the tricks of the trade. She is greeted by none-other-than mother superior Sonia Braga (now, my curiosity is piqued). Then, we are introduced to a dare we say ""slutty"" nun-in-training and other weird sisters who run a very strange orphanage. Bill Nighy comes in as a cardinal (I kept hearing ""All I want for Christmas"" every time he appeared onscreen) who may be up to something. Strange things begin to happen with one orphan in particular, and then before you know it, you're seeing all sort of shocking, strange things that make Rosemary's Baby look like a comedy. That said, I was totally enraptured by this point and a few surprises that tie the film to the original Omen ensue. The trailer tries to market is like all the other schlocky nun films, but this one is so much more. I give it 10 stars as it is unique, compelling, visually intriguing and at times frightening.

Worlds better than I expected!,"The First Omen hit theaters earlier this month and if you are a fan of the original film from 1976, this is a must watch for you. The film is directed by Arkasha Stevenson and serves as her major motion picture debut. The newest installment to the Omen franchise takes place in 1971 before the events of The Omen (1976) and does a great job of filling in some gaps to the Damien story, along with adding some easter eggs that pay a nice homage to the original movie.

Let me just start by saying that I loved this movie. The story gets moving almost right away and they do an awesome job of telling a truly gripping and terrifying story. Nell Tiger Free's performance as Maragaret is raw and chills you to the bone and this blogger won't be surprised if this is only the first of a very long career as a feared and revered scream queen. I love how daring Arkasha Stevenson was in her direction of the film. The scenes in this movie were so graphic that it very nearly received an NC-17 rating. After submitting the film four separate times, the MPA finally relented and awarded the R rating only after the scene (you'll know which one when you see it) was cut down from its original thirteen seconds. The graphicness of the film coupled with Free's performance added to the horror of the story, making this one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.

"Watch ""Immaculate"" instead of this unnecessary movie","""The First Omen"" is a disappointing addition to the revered Omen franchise. Unlike its predecessors, which masterfully blend suspense, horror, and storytelling, this prequel struggles to find its footing. The pacing is sluggish, dragging viewers through scenes that feel extraneous and fail to contribute to the narrative. The plot, intended to provide a backstory to the chilling legacy of Damien, is convoluted and lacks coherence, leaving audiences more confused than captivated.

Compared to ""Immaculate,"" which offers a gripping plot, stellar performances, and relentless tension, ""The First Omen"" falls short on all fronts. The acting is lackluster, and the characters are underdeveloped, making it hard to invest emotionally in their fates. The film's attempts at horror are tepid, lacking the edge-of-your-seat moments that made the original films iconic.

Overall, ""The First Omen"" feels unnecessary. The original Omen movies stand strong on their own, and this prequel does little to enhance or expand upon the existing lore. For fans of the franchise, it may be worth a watch out of curiosity, but it's unlikely to leave a lasting impression. With its slow pace, confusing story, and failure to capture the essence of its predecessors, it earns a disappointing 3/10.

The First Omen: A Worthy Prequel,"One of two high profile 2024 horror films featuring forced impregnation of nuns by a shadowy cabal inside the Catholic Church set in Italy (the other is Immaculate), this is also the debut feature film by Arkasha Stevenson.

It might seem strange to have such strongly similar films coming out at the same time, but it is a reflection of the politics of the day, in a time when religiously motivated people managed to overturn Roe vs. Wade in the US, films about women's bodily autonomy and forced pregnancy, were sure to come out. Strange however that the bad guys in both of the movies are catholics in Italy (where abortion has been legal since 1978) while in reality most of the effort to remove bodily autonomy from American women came from evangelical americans (not to say that catholics are pro-choice, they aren't, but they are just less vocal about it).

Looking at this film, however, it's easy to see why European Catholicism was chosen as the villain of the piece, it just looks better for a horror film, the gothic elements are inbuilt as is the use of strange rituals and dead languages (Latin) giving everything an eeriness that would be pretty different than setting it in a Southern Baptist Church in Alabama (which would be a wholly different kind of horror). Arkasha Stevenson makes great use of the setting and its look to bring us an assured and lush visual feast in a movie that is never less than entertaining, ending right where The Omen (1976) begins.",9.0,11 June 2024
Terrible in every way...,,1.0,9 June 2024
Horror Porn tasteless bolstered by ageing has beens,"I was interested ,maybe drawn in by the publicity for the prequel for the classic original,but in spite of the opening flavoured religious hierarchy Introduction with two great character actors, shades of the original opening scene in The Omen, from then on the developing Heroine descended into schlock porno horror.

Maybe a little too strong for my generation,and the later dark cinematic scenes,which obscured mercifully for viewers what was being portrayed. Fire and Brimstone ensued,is the film now a satire on religion....? This is not a beautiful film,as my review title infers.

From then on I took a more cynical view of the production value,is this really what the next generation want to view,or maybe curiosity's value how far filmmaker's will stoop to capture cinema audiences.

The fact that Disney took this in as an almost immediate streamer, sums up that distributor's moral compass.",2.0,9 June 2024
Do not waste your time,"This movie is an insult to the original.

This story is a direct prequel to the original. It's about a young girl going to Italy, working in an orphanage, to take her vows as a nun.

While there she meets a young girl who is troubled. Those troubles lead to her growing suspicion about things she had experienced as a young girl.

Que the priest, Father Brennan, and the rest is, as they say, history.

It is very dark and hard to see. The acting is slow and disjointed (think high school, only worse). The story makes no sense and some of imagery is unnecessary and counterproductive to the story.

There was no need to show close ups of female genitalia nor was there any need to continuously show the nuns smoking.

If you want a really slow movie, with wooden acting and poor storyline, this may be for you.",1.0,12 April 2024
Dull and predictable,,4.0,4 April 2024
Mediocre at best,"Actually, the first half wasn't so bad. There were even some humorous elements that helped to give the movie some emotional depth and bring out the darker parts. I was hoping that this would continue to the end, maybe in the vein of ""Brand New Cherry Flavor"". Stylistically, there were some welcome nods towards Dario Argento, and cinematographically, it was pretty good throughout. It felt as if the director could've taken it somewhere. But somehere in the middle, it quickly took a nosedive and came crashing down, mainly due to the script. The ideas were not developed in an interesting way, the main plot twist was predictable from the start, some scenes were basically borrowed from ""Rosemary's Baby"", some others from the ""Nun"" series, and there were some really strange plot holes and unbelievable moments along the way, including the main motivation of the antagonists. Some dialogues and reactions of the characters were also unbelievable. But I guess if you've seen the ""Nun"" series and various side projects of ""The Conjuring"" universe, it's still a step up from there. Of course, this is only me rationalizing for the time and ticket money spent. The truth is, it's nowhere near the original ""Omen"" series, and you won't be missing much, if you don't go see this one.",5.0,17 April 2024

Such a waste of time,"I recently had the misfortune of watching *The First Omen*, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare indeed. This horror flick promised a gripping storyline that would keep me on the edge of my seat, but instead, it left me questioning why I wasted precious hours of my life on it.

The storyline was not only bad but also poorly executed. It felt like a mishmash of clichés and predictable plot twists that failed to evoke any real fear or suspense. The characters were one-dimensional, and their actions often defied all logic, making it impossible to connect with them or care about their fate.

To make matters worse, *The First Omen* has been overrated by many, which only adds insult to injury. I can't help but wonder if those who praised this film actually watched the same movie I did.

In conclusion, *The First Omen* was a colossal disappointment, and I would strongly advise against wasting your time and money on it. There are far better horror movies out there that are actually worth watching.",2.0,18 April 2024

Really horrible horror flick,"I had just finished watching the omen and omen 2 and the first omen came up as one to watch so I thought I'd give it a try. It's quite possibly one of the worst story lines I've seen in a long time. A total remake of Rosemary's baby. This story line is so disjointed and seems to focus mostly on the choral singing most of the time. It is, along with Rosemary's baby, a movie I wouldn't recommend to anyone. On a positive note though I do have to say that the actors did a very good job considering what they had to work with. This is definitely not something I'd recommend, and I did watch the whole movie, hoping it would get better. It didn't!",2.0,6 June 2024

This movie needed little to be great,,5.0,6 June 2024
Coulda been great but ended up being Terrible.,"I grew up loving the OG Omen from the 70's. That was a great film. The sequel was entertaining but nowhere near as good. Anything after that has had a history of being really bad. This newest entry is no exception. The acting was passable, some of the camera work was decent, the early 70's theme in Rome looked great... But I spent the entire movie waiting for a story to unfold. With every scene I figured, Ok, here comes something good... but it never came. It just hinted of a storyline till the last 7 minutes when suddenly it revealed a plot and a story but by then, it's too late the movie ended. Bummer. It relied on jump scares that were not scary to thrill the lowbrow folks in the audience and meandered trying to set a mood that really wasn't new or interesting, just rehashed stuff I've seen a million times in other movies since the 70's... I don't suspect this will be a sleeper hit, because it tries to create a slow burn and that will be too slow for the masses. I love a slow burn as long as it reveals something... Other than the last 7 minutes you would never even know you were watching an omen movie.",4.0,5 April 2024
One omen too many,"I really thought this was a load of rubbish. It started off ok with a slow build of tension, but it totally failed to deliver. One problem was that it just wasn't spooky enough. It's actually not too difficult to make the Catholic Church, clergy and nuns come over as creepy but here it wasn't really accomplished. The, as could be predicted, evil, reverend mother, was about as scary as my French teacher. The equally predictable revelation that the avuncular guardian was demonic really hardly even registered with Nighy's playing of the part. As seems to have been standard for decades now, the scariest bits were the loudest. Great director though he was, I think Hitchcock started that one off. Now, horror movies are, of course, meant to be bonkers, but the notion that the true devotees of Catholicism thought it was a good idea to resurrect the antichrist in order to boost their own church's ratings seems especially ludicrous. I enjoyed Greg Peck's cameo though.",3.0,9 April 2024
"Lame, offensive and just plain sty","I'm a huge fan of the original Omen film. Scenes in the picture horrify me to tears each time I watch it. After mediocre after mediocre sequels and one remake, I was hoping for something good. The picture is full of fine actors who I have enjoyed for years. That got my hopes up for what turned out to be a gross crazy quilt of the original premise along with bits of 'Rosemary's Baby,' 'Alien Resurrection,' and Lord knows what else. Needless to say, I wasn't surprised or horrified. I was however offended a bit on behalf of the Catholic Church and folks who enjoy Armageddon-type horror tales. It was just stupid.",1.0,3 June 2024
"A few good scares, other then that dumb and meaningless.","Alot of people are recommending this in the reviews which had me convinced and I ended up watching it.

Not an utter disappointment , its watchable but honestly its no way on earth worth the hype people are creating.

I enjoyed talk to me and evil dead rise much more then this one. This is nowhere near as fun as those films so now its up-to you to decide if you want to watch it.

Good Things: The sound, some creepy moments. A few good scenes. Beautiful women. Yes the two main nuns are good for the eyes.

Bad Things: Crap story, stupidly told. Unbelievable predictable plot. Bad cgi, bad depiction of The devil. Overall a meaningless movie. A Rosemarys baby wanna be ripoff at best.",5.0,9 April 2024
Predictable and not as scary as The Omen,,5.0,8 April 2024
Shocking,"How can a horror film be this bad? Started slow which isn't an issue but never improved.

For a prequel you can see where this will end if you've watched the films, but how it gets there is slow, predictable, time consuming and sometimes comical. There are a few scenes which made me laugh, yes laugh, in a horror film!!!

There are scenes that added no value to the film but seam to be padding and others that although make sense later on, could have been trimmed down.

I won't spoil it but I can't imagine at any horror fan will like this and any 6+ ratings are paid for.

I'd rewatch the original again instead of this.",1.0,5 June 2024
The Catholic church adopting marketing strategies,"If you put aside all the immense BS regarding organized religions (here: Catholicism; but they're all the same - hypocrisy with smoke and mirrors) and concentrate on the movie itself, there are more than several flaws making it a waste of time. Except for one thing. So, writing and dialogues are hollow and superficial, with a purpose only to pause chants in Latin (btw. Latin may be scary, if you try to learn it - all the grammar and so on), adopted by the church as official language, and almost non-existent before the ancient Rome. Then it's the incorporating the Church mythology and fairy tales about three sixes and so on. Direction is also a bit strange, leading the thin story (all could be said in about 20 minutes, in a YT video, without the rest of the movie) to nothing and basically instructing audience to watch the first installment ""The Omen"". However, after the MAD parody of the ""original"" movie (a comic presentation in the magazine meany years ago), one can not take any of this seriously, let alone scary. There are jump scares, but not that much, so the story tries to rely on the concept itself as a horror. But, since it does not function outside the closed religious circle, it's just a shallow construct, away from the reality nearly as Star Wars (despite being located in ""familiar"" scenery). About that marketing thing: the whole premise of the movie is based on a classic marketing strategy: if there are no consumer needs, try to create them. May work for chocolate and detergents, but here ... One thing is really fantastic in the movie: the ethereal and out-of-this-world natural beauty of Maria Caballero (Luz). The rest of the cast was merely professional, within the screen time limits. Simply put, the movie is not good. Watch ""The Omen"" again instead and leave it at that.",5.0,2 June 2024
"Good atmosphere, but ultimately a whole lotta nothing","Once it's over, you get the sense having watched the original is something of a requirement. I did not, so maybe that's why it felt a little pointless. There's a bunch of build up. Creepy tension. A big underlying mystery to it throughout. But the reveal and lack of a satisfying conclusion just sort of ruins it. Having said that, how would someone ""fix"" what seems lacking here, anyway? Should there have been a definitive fight? Some thrilling pursuit? It feels unfair to criticize when I have no alternative ideas which would improve any of it, but that doesn't change what this is. An overall empty result at the end of a series of events that is only substantive given knowledge of the original film.

If for no other reason, it's worth watching to see Nell Tiger Free acting really well. There are some long scenes where she just gets into it by herself, and when you remember she's doing this entire thing solo for the camera it's just impressive. I didn't know her name before this. I do now.",5.0,31 May 2024

Its okay.,"Quite violent, probably has symbolism for those who like looking for that in a film. I think this is a film someone who watched the movie about the girl getting slowly inducted into a flower cult because her family is killed by her sister. I started putting this in the background I think its just an okay horror movie. The characters don't have too much personality probably to make them creepy when they do things, and probably so the directer didn't have to make sure what they did was out of personality because that woud be more to manage in consistency. This is probably a thriller, horror for cheap scares and less story.",2.0,8 May 2024
Boring,"Despite an impressive supporting cast and some decent horror imagery, this movie fails to draw you in or give you any reason to invest in the story. As a result it fails to hold your attention. There are long stretches of the movie in which nothing much seems to happen. I guess they were going for a slow burn type of thing, but again there's no immersion or reason to care. Since this is a prequel we already know more or less what's going to happen. But the premise still had potential, it just wasn't implemented in a very interesting or engaging way. The ending seems to be setting up a sequel to take place after the events of The Omen that probably won't happen; but which seems like it would have made for a much more interesting and original story had the filmmakers reduced the entirety of this movie to a brief prelude and focused on it instead.",4.0,10 June 2024
A Celluloid Abomination,"I knew it was going to be bad because it had too many good reviews for a horror movie. Terrible bad horror movies like Get Out and Hereditary also ridiculously received good reviews so there was no surprise here. No one lucid could possibly think this was good. After the only good part ( the intro ) it's all way downhill. The first half is more like Nuns go Wild. Then it just becomes a boring, awful miasma of nonsensical scenes. After last years also awful Exorcist sequel I didn't think I'd see another high profile horror movie that bad but I stand corrected. This was pure unwatchable junk that I unfortunately entirely watched thinking it couldn't get worse. Again I was corrected. Watch the original again or if you want to get scared a Scooby Doo episode, not this trash.",1.0,7 June 2024
Same story (80%) than Immaculate,"It looks like hollywood greenlighted the script twice. Once with Immaculate and once with the First Omen, and set up the release date a couple weeks apart. Unfortunately for this one, I saw Immaculate first. Because of this, it took a good half hour before I start to get engaged in the movie.

The First Omen is technically competent and brings the 70's to life quite well. Acting is good across the board. However, I can't believe that Charle Dance is there just as a cameo and that the production dismissed him like that!

The tension build slowly and the feeling of unease and dread slowly creeps in, ramping up in the third act of the movie.

There are some kills in the movie that are done in a very Final Destination way, which is in line with the deaths you saw in The Omens. The camera like to linger on gruesome practical FX that are expertly executed. There is a scene, in the third act, that I never thought I would see on the big screen...

Overall, good movie that falls victime of Immaculate.",5.0,16 April 2024
A Mixed Bag of Potential and Disappointment,"The First Omen"" is a film that leaves you with mixed feelings. While there are moments of enjoyment, the overall experience feels somewhat hollow, like a story that never truly begins. The film sets up an intriguing premise but ultimately fails to deliver on its promise, leaving viewers with a sense of unfulfilled potential.

One of the main issues with ""The First Omen"" is its pacing. The runtime feels excessively long, yet the story progresses at a sluggish pace. Much of the film is spent building up to something significant, but when the plot finally starts to develop, the movie abruptly ends. This lack of substantial progression creates a sense of emptiness, as if the narrative is all build-up with no satisfying payoff.

Despite these shortcomings, there are aspects of the film that can be appreciated. The atmospheric tension is well-crafted, with a few scenes that genuinely capture the eerie, unsettling vibe that fans of the genre crave. The performances are competent, and there are glimpses of potential in the storyline that hint at what could have been a more engaging experience.

In the end, ""The First Omen"" is a film that teeters on the edge of being compelling but falls short due to its slow pacing and lack of substantial plot development. While I found some enjoyment in the atmosphere and performances, the overall experience was disappointing. It feels like a story that never truly takes off, leaving viewers with more questions than answers. If you're looking for a horror film that delivers on suspense and thrills, this one might not fully satisfy. However, it does offer a glimpse of what could have been a captivating tale, making it a watchable, albeit frustrating, experience.",5.0,5 June 2024

For the first half of the movie, nothing happens and you start getting bored as the story goes nowhere and keeps on getting dragged. The second half is where the story picks up and it felts like something is going on.

"""The First Omen"" stumbles slightly under its own weight.","""The First Omen"" isn't just a prequel, it's a dark baptism for the franchise. Director Arkasha Stevenson throws us headfirst into cold, gothic visuals.

Mark Korven's unsettling score create a constant sense of dread. Director Arkasha Stevenson isn't afraid to push boundaries, with a particularly brutal (and brilliantly disturbing) birthing scene that will stay with you long after the credits roll.

""The First Omen"" stumbles slightly under its own weight. The pacing drags. Trimming some fat (say maybe 30 minutes or so), would have tightened the film's grip.

The true sticking point might not be for die-hard fans of the original trilogy. The twist ending, while intriguing, feels like a creative liberty that clashes with the established lore. It leaves you wanting more, but makes you scratch your head over if we even need to explore it. I guess you can chalk the ending up to Hollywood thinking new fanchise instead focusing on what is in front of them in the single film.

Like ""Immaculate"" different type of ending for this type of film, and if you haven't seen any other film in the franchise, you might enjoy it more. But again, the ending and what it hints at, does not work.",5.0,12 April 2024
