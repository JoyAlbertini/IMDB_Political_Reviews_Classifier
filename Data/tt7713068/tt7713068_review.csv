"Entertaining at times, but is all over the place","Birds of Prey: and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn, is a movie I had high hopes for but it fell flat. I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences.

However, This film has a lot of problems, most of the performances in this film are very shoddy, especially from Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work}, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best. The humour that they're going for doesn't work at all I chuckled maybe once, and it was the same for my theatre. They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU, the way he was portrayed was nothing like how he is in the comics and it seems like he is just trying to be some knock off version of the Joker. Also why is the film titled Birds of Prey? This is a Harley Quinn Movie, just like the trailers the Birds of Prey are barely in it and when they were they had small glimpses of being cool characters but for the most part they were some of the most cliched early 2000's era superhero characters I have seen since that era.

Overall, I found Birds of Prey to be a disappointment I came into this film very optimistic but got let down, due to the fact that this films writing was just plain bad. If Margot Robbie's and Ewan Mcgregor's performances weren't as great as what they were with the nice compliments of the characters costumes it would have been completely boring and cliched garbage.",5.0,6 February 2020
Entertaining but a bit messy.,"Birds of prey shows that DC has finally righted the ship after several early stumbles in this franchise. By focusing on smaller, more personal stories with more personal stakes. Birds of prey is a very entertaining movie, albeit one with some irritating flaws.

Firstly, Cathy Yan directed the hell out of this movie. She really knows how to frame an exciting action scene with nice wide, full body shots to show off the great stunt work. The movies style and colour pallet are very eye catching and visually interesting. Margot Robbie continues to be excellent as this franchises version of Harley Quinn, and Ewen McGregor looks like he's having the time of his life as a sleazy but intimidating villain.

Most of the movies problems for me come from the script. The first half is very messy as the movie bounces around and moves back and forth in a Rashomon attempt that really didn't work and kind of annoyed me. Once an action scene in a police evidence locker takes place though, the movie calmed down considerably and is a lot more watchable. Also, while the other members of the cast and the villain are entertaining to watch, they only have only surface level characterisation, seemingly interesting on the surface, but not really much underneath. Some ardent birds of prey fans may be disappointed in the lack of actual birds of prey, given about 85% of this is a Harley Quinn movie, which leads me to wonder if they side the birds of prey name for brand recognition only.

In conclusion, birds of prey is a fun, colourful time at the movies, But some serious screenplay flaws prevent it soaring to the heights of the DCEU, but it comfortably pitches high above the trainwreck that was suicide squad.",7.0,8 February 2020
"This is not a ""man hating"" movie...","Is this a good movie? Not really. Is it a bad movie? Not at all. This is not a 10, but certainly nowhere near a 1. Don't get distracted by everyone saying that's it's a bad film. Go form your own opinion! Like someone in these comment said, too bad some reviewers have a political agenda to push on this film accusing it of ""man hating"". It's a comic book movie based around a female. In comics, most of the villains are men... so, yeah, I don't know what people were expecting, but she has to beat man!

Anyways, personally I think the movie is bizarre, funny and quirky. Just like Harley Quinn. Also, Margot Robbie is perfect for the role.",7.0,10 March 2020

MARGOT STEALS THE SHOW.,"Funny, non stop action, kinda all over the place. Margot Robbie absolutely steals the show.",7.0,12 February 2020
Fun movie!,Margot Robbie is the perfect Harley Quinn. Over all BOP was super fun. Great action and great music. Rosie Perez is meh at best. Ewan kills it per usual. I love that they made an R rated comic book film. DC has the balls to do it knowing it won't make as much $$$ which is probably why this is one of the better comic movies to come out in a while. 7/10🖤,7.0,13 February 2020
Boring and forgettable,"While Margot Robbie is a good Harley Quinn, the character was not given enough arc. The plot was predictable and mainstream, especially due to lack of a strong antagonist. The main antagonist, played by Ewan McGregor, was not developed and hence did not add significant value to the plot story. Although some of the fight scenes were entertaining, the film as a whole was truly forgettable.",4.0,6 February 2020
I don't understand the hate at all,"I would like to preface this review by saying I am a massive DC Comics nerd and also a man, so all these guys saying that ""only feminist women who don't understand the comics like this movie"" are completely wrong.

The hate this movie gets makes no sense to me at all. This is a stylish, superhero comedy with excellent directing, acting and action. The cinematography during fight scenes was just beautiful and the fact that they are allowed to show graphic violence makes them so brutal.

Also, the comedy lands so well. It's so strange to me to see the same people who give Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy high ratings give this such a low one, in my opinion it tops Deadpool in the comedy department.

I would say the only weakness in this movie (for me) was the portrayal of Black Mask, only simply because I prefer his comic counterpart. That being said, I don't mind most of the changes to these characters in comparison to the comics, I thought Margot Robbie's performance as Harley was absolutely fantastic, it really shows of her version of Harley without that awful script that was Suicide Squad. Jurnee Smollett gives such a strong performance as Canary, while I know she is very different in the comics, I liked the different approach to the character. Mary Elizabeth Winstead did a great job, I just wish they had fleshed her out a bit more, but still she was very good and had an intriguing backstory. Ella Jay Basco gives one of the most convincing child performances I've seen in a while, it would be really cool to see her as batgirl one day. Lastly, Rosie Perez was great as Montoya, who I was happy to see finally get a big role in a movie since she plays a big part in many comic stories and the animated series. Comic book movies change characters all the time, I don't know why everyone cares so much with this movie specially.

I seriously do not understand the hate, here we have a movie that doesn't give a crap and is willing to show us some graphic fight scenes with great choreography and comedy which lands and isn't cringy, like in previous DCEU films, and some great performances, and every hates it. I'm 99% sure that this movie is just hated because men have to hate movies dominated by females for some reason. I'm not trying to say this movie is The Dark Knight but it's strong in a lot of aspects and succeeds in what it's trying to be. For Christ sake guys, it's not trying to be the Godfather, why are your reviews so harsh.",8.0,30 March 2021

It made me sleepy.,"I'm glad I had my phone, the first half of the film was so boring, the second part was less boring, but still not great. Margot Robbie is good in the role, and she has some great fight scenes, the trouble is that the remainder of the film is so tedious. Good visuals, the trouble is the core of the film simply isn't there to make anything meaningful.

Ewan McGregor was wasted, isn't there a better role for him out there somewhere??? Surely???? He was a dreadful antagonist, not his capabilities, but the character, did they intentionally make him lifeless?

I can't help but compare it to The Joker, it doesn't compare favourably. It looked good in the trailers, but they literally showed all of the action scenes.

I was expecting to be entertained, but in truth I was bored, and judging by others sat next to me yawning, so were others. 3/10",3.0,13 February 2020
I liked it,"I liked it. It was entertaining and that's what I wanted for a film. I do get why people are whining about the ""men are bad"" agenda, but meh. Just didn't bother me in all honesty.

Overall I liked it.",8.0,14 February 2020
"A great all-girls group film, Birds of Prey eases itself up in the sky though meeting some obstacles to finding its worthy predators.","Admittedly speaking, remember there was a time when DC Universe was bashed because most of their movies were directed by Zack Snyder who decided that style-over-substance was more pivotal to making superhero films? Then, came David Ayer with a set of the best movie trailers ever created but the outcome for the anti-hero film, Suicide Squad was at best, a mediocre motion picture.

Now after Shazam!, Aquaman & the masterpiece Joker, DC presents us with Birds of Prey, the fourth entry movie that proves that their tables have pretty much turned around by finding suitable directors for their movies and that they are catching up to compete with the Marvel Universe. No feud here please.

Here's my thoughts on Birds of Prey:

The movie features slick action scenes which complete with very acrobatic-like choreography that constantly pleases the eyes of everyone who are looking forward for femme fatales kicking ass. There are plenty of them to keep you amazed.

Birds of Prey also delivers a vigorous energy throughout, it feels like you are high on drugs. The close-ups feel very intimate yet feel very caricature in a positive way. The quality of cameras & the colour palette capture a reality of life, giving a sense of how rough it actually is, very dark and gritty but... also sometimes sprinkles the dour tone with graciously boisterous and delicate tinted colours. The occasional slo-mo ampes up the already intense energy.

Some of you might have asked regarding the feminist movement. Birds of Prey is a done right feminist film. A key successful factor to driving a feminist film is to create an innate story on women without being pushy on the political agenda. Birds of Prey does that. Another thing is this is not a guy-turn-girl remakes (Yes, I'm watching you Ghostbusters & Ocean's 8). And BOP does not or rarely knocks down the men genes as weak or indecisive. Kudos Birds of Prey!

Now, let's talk about Margot Robbie & Mary Elizabeth Winstead. These two really go beyond the next level to dive into their character as uniquely as possible. Margot Robbie as always should be receiving a standing ovation as Harley Quinn again, after the meh Suicide Squad. She restrains from letting anyone steals her spotlight. If her and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker are caught together in a love story, it will be the best romance movie of the decade. The complexity and different types of deranged personalities they uphold. Wow! Winstead as Huntress is the runner up here, she gives out a hot breeze of aura that it is hard to back away from. Her charismatic sexual energy captures the attention like a bullseye 🎯. Bell as Black Canary is cool, but not as great as the other two. Bella as Cain shows to be mischievous but her character only pretty much follows where the major characters take her.

It also offers decent humour overall. Harley Quinn is consciously great in this, her facial movements contribute a lot! Some are fresh from the oven, others are a bit obsolete but those humours though feel old keep us glued to the screen.

Final battle, the best thing is the lack of unrealistic weaponry that they occupy which makes it all feels so real. It is entertaining and fun too as there are certain scenes that feature a low amount of quick cuts.

Now, the most detectable problem with this movie is it spends so much time on character development of the all-girls group that it forgets that they can excite the audience with the combo pack. An hour later and they are still focusing on so many character devs!

Because of this, the relationship between members of Birds of Prey is very shadowy and leaves an unsatisfied feeling by the end. Like somehow they have been forced exponentially to know and work with one another.

So many developments but they forget Roman's character, the main antagonist which feels quite underdeveloped. When a scene of him pops up especially after 40% of the film, it really wants to tell something meaningful about him, but eventually moves on with it, providing us with a lack of knowledge of what his wholesome embodies.

Hyena & police cop. With a lack of screen time, we do not really see Hyena attacking people at all which some of you might have anticipated. Renee as the cop is one that is really bad at acting, it needs fixing. It is like watching a brick talks with try-hard emotions.

While this centres on supervillains, Birds of Prey fails on the costume design. Not a single character clothes himself/herself as a good superhero model portrayal of a costume. It feels very lazy thus, this however tones down the great energy the movie has possessed. It is so bad that varsity students can design them better.

Verdict: Imaginative & darkly flamboyant, Birds of Prey proves that the comeback of DC is possible, adapting many characters into the big screen as a beacon of call to level itself with the colossal Marvel.",6.0,5 February 2020
What is people's problem with this one?,"Overall it's an ok movie. Not the best, not the worst and waaaaay better than suicide squad. It feels like people are hating on this movie just because the main cast is female. There are hundreds of movies just like this with a male cast that people love e.g the Fast and Furious franchise, Olympus has fallen, Taken series etc.

Just enjoy the movie or not for what it is, but don't hate it because it's a female cast.",7.0,6 November 2020
Better than SUICIDE SQUAD,"Did you catch the 2016 DCEU disappointment SUICIDE SQUAD with Will Smith as Deadshot and Jared Leto as the Joker? Many people (myself included) thought that that film was ""just fine, nothing special"" but were impressed with the way Margot Robbie handled the Harley Quinn character and wished for a standalone film that featured the Harley Quinn character.

Be careful what you wish for.

BIRDS OF PREY (AND THE FANTABULOUS EMANCIPATION OF ONE HARLEY QUINN) is the answer to that wish and while it is slightly better than SUICIDE SQUAD, it still isn't all that....well...Fantabulous... of a film.

BIRDS OF PREY (which I hear is now being relabeled HARLEY QUINN: BIRDS OF PREY) is produced by Margot Robbie's production company and features an all female lead cast (the villain is a male) and a female Writer and a female Director. Consequently, this is a ""female empowerment"" film where the self-described ""tough chicks"" band together to defeat the male villain.

I applaud the effort and the idea behind the movie, but as a film, this one didn't quite work for me.

I start with the main focus of this film - Harley Quinn. This is just not a character, I discovered, that I want to spend an entire film with. She is, at it turns out, a very good SUPPORTING character, but not one that is interesting enough (at least for me) to carry a whole movie. I will give Margot Robbie credit...her interpretation of the character is interesting and that performance kept me focused throughout.

The other Birds of Prey are just as interesting. For the first time in I can't tell you, Rosie Perez did not annoy me in her role. She played earnest, frustrated Police Officer Renee Montoya and I found myself rooting for her when she was on the screen. Same goes for Jurnee Smollett-Bell's interpretation of Black Canary a character I knew very little about and was intrigued (though her ""Super Power"" was suddenly sprung on the audience with very little foreshadowing - foreshadowing that could have helped). And, finally, Mary Elizabeth Winstead almost steals the film as the revenge-seeking Huntress, a character I really enjoyed and hope I see again (though, I'm learning my lesson - let it be as a supporting character in another film and not her own, standalone film).

So, this film has 4 interesting characters at the top, but the issue is that they don't come together as a team until VERY late in the film (in a finale showdown that was the highlight of the film for me), so I really couldn't tell if there was any chemistry between these characters/actresses. I think there MIGHT have been, but no real sample size to tell.

Fairing less well as a character was Ewan McGregor's one-note take on super-narcissistic Roman Sionis/Black Mask. The character was pretty much in front of you at the start of the film and was still the same one-note character at the end. Also not ""doing it for me"" was Ella Jay Basco as Cassandra Cain, the street kid that becomes the focal point of the bad guys in the film (and the character the Birds of Prey must band together to save). I didn't much care for this character - or the performance - so I had no real emotional investment in whether or not the Birds of Prey could save her.

The Direction by Cathy Yan is professional and competent and the final showdown does show signs of originality and brilliance. I'll give her credit, she caught my attention with the last 1/2 hour of this film - much more so than she did with the first 79 minutes.

A better effort at this type of anti-hero comic book adventure (certainly better than SUICIDE SQUAD) but the DCEU still has not stuck the landing on this.

I encourage them to keep trying.

Bird-Brained,"GRADE: C-

THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.

IN BRIEF: A disappointing superhero movie that is big, loud, and garish but no fun, despite Margot Robbie's valiant efforts.

JIM'S REVIEW: Most superhero movies either take themselves too seriously or are so tongue-firmly-in-cheek that they lose sight of the plot as they distract with the violent action. Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn), a long title for an even longer film, falls into the latter category. The film is a spin-off to the successful Suicide Squad (2016), only this time it focuses on its most enduring character, that crazed kewpie doll killer babe, Harley Quinn, who has been ceremoniously dumped by her beau, Joker. That she is again played by the talented Margot Robbie is the movie's greatest asset.

It sure isn't its disjointed screenplay by Christina Hodson. While the film is directed with assurance by Cathy Yan, the story is a mess, as it volleys back and forth with enough confusing flashbacks, flash-forwards, and freeze frames that one becomes quite giddy from all of the weak storytelling and fancy editing. The narrative structure is comprised of an overabundance of voiceovers and non-stop exposition and so little character development. Their backstories literally stop much of the action and pop up unexpectedly to fill in some bio details, but those personal dramas come off as big chunks of information that upend the logical flow of the plot and interfere with the many random combat sequences. (At times, I began to think that some scenes in the film were missing as Harley is captured one moment and totally free to do mayhem in the very next scene.) A film does not need to be this chaotic to show its own chaos, but Birds of Prey is at least true to itself.

The plot involves a battle over a rare diamond as the MacGuffin, but it is more of a showcase for women empowerment as the female class continually beats the crap outta the male gender. The movie is loaded with highly choreographed fights that are so cartoonish that the movie become unintentionally laughable. One expects Wily E. Coyote to join in the fun. Of course, that never happens...although we do get to see Bruce the Hyena. In all this ruckus, one never feels any semblance of real danger. It's all manufactured violence and exaggerated dance moves. The director seems obsessed with slo-mo techniques and moments of enhanced speed which only serve to show the foolishness of this whole venture. Dare I say the pacing is indeed off.

The actors do persevere. Ms. Robbie is again fine in her signature role, although she has no moments to show any vulnerability as she did in the original source. Here, it's all fists of blood and slapstick comedy. She is joined by her all-girls club which includes the Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), and Ella Jay Basco as Cassandra Cain, a teenage pickpocket whose fast slight of hand causes an unfortunate chain of events. The primary villains, Ewan McGregor as Gotham City's latest megalomaniac Roman Sionis aka Black Mask and an unrecognizable Chris Messina as his henchman, Victor Zsasz, try to whip up some evil, but they are undone by the contrived and silly script.

Still the movie has a nice look to it. Ms. Yan does know how to create a dysfunctional world, even if the inhabitants are one dimensional figures lost in this DC universe. Kudos go out to Matthew Libatique' atmospheric photography and K.K. Barrett's set design. (I particularly like the funhouse fight sequence.)

Birds of Prey is a failed attempt to mix action or comedy. Just as the mixed-up movie haphazardly stitches together its fragmented set pieces into a frenzied patchwork of ineptitude, it only seems befitting that I conclude this review in the same manner with my final words: may wanna Girls fun have. ain't it (freeze) This.",4.0,23 August 2020
Really enjoyed this,"I've been a fan of Harley since BTAS & thought she was the only decent thing in Suicide Squad.

Think the film shouldn't have really bothered with the Birds Of Prey theme, Just having the film focus around Harley would have worked just as well.

Such a shame that it doesn't seem to have set the box office alight but hopefully the fact that is was filmed on a low budget which it will recouperate will lead to a 3rd one. Harley is DCs deadpool character & that's defo not a bad thing...",8.0,12 February 2020
Silly and Entertaining,"In Gotham City, the Joker breaks up with Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and without his protection, several criminals that have a beef with her hunt her down. When the teenager Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco) pickpockets a diamond that has the account numbers of a fortune from the gangster Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina), who is the right-hand of the powerful criminal Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), he put a contract on her. Harley Quinn, Police Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), Helena ""The Huntress"" Bertinelli (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and Dinah ""Black Canary"" Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) team up to protect Cassandra.

""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" is a silly and entertaining adventure of the anarchic psychiatrist Harley Quinn. The plot is a mess with many silly scenes trying to be funny, but the conclusion is full of action and entertains. My vote is six.

Margot Robbie Does Great as Harley Quinn,"Finally got a chance to watch Birds of Prey yesterday. I thought this movie would perform better at the box office, but sadly it isn't. Margot Robbie is an outstanding actress and I hoped the movie would have greater success for her. I'm not a huge DC fan, but still had to watch this. I enjoyed it and felt like Margot was very entertaining in her role as Harley Quinn. She was tough, funny, and was multi-dimensional. This wasn't a great film in my opinion, but an enjoyable good film that I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to.",8.0,11 February 2020
"Finally, a superhero movie I (almost) like","The film is fun, easy to watch and unlike many other ""comic book movies"" doesn't reek of hidden sexism and heteronormativity. It still feels very binary at times, but I guess it can be excused, since it's still better than anything else on the market and since Harley's emancipation (which is the main plot point of the movie) consists of recovering from abusive relationship (with a man) and actualizing her femininity outside of frames of ""male gaze"". It is an important point of Harley's story, since when she's in relationship with Joker she's often presented as a very dependent person with fractured sense of self. This movie does a great job giving her an agenda and tracing her journey of looking for new identity, not based on being in romantic relationship or being someone's sidekick. At times it kinda feels like commodification of feminism, but I will excuse any commodification for a movie about group of badass chicks in stylish outfits antagonizing local gay supervillain. It would be nice to have more films like this, because I am really tired of heteronormativity in this genre and in 2020-s diversity in themes and representation shouldn't be perceived as some kind of forced agenda.

By the way, was quite amused to see some parallels with Tarantino's Death Proof. Disgraceful chick flicks all the way, from 2007 to this daY. And I need moooooore!!!!!!",,27 September 2021
Wild funny and faced paced,"Good movie. Not the best in the dceu, but not bad. DC has been on the right track since Aquaman. I loved the very cartoonish feel the movie had. Never took itself too seriously. Lots of humor and a decent plot. Fun action scenes and the movie was very fast paced. The way the story is told is definitely inspired by Deadpool, which works in some cases, and doesn't in others. Liked the villains, especially Victor. Cool to seem him on the big screen. Liked how it left Joker out (though I'm a huge fan of him). Hate pop music but the pop heavy soundtrack was actually very good. Cool to see a movie with all those badass woman, but without the overly feminist feel. Overall a good movie but not amazing. The hyena could have been in the movie a bit more.",7.0,7 February 2020
A real disappointment... Incoherent & muddled,"A dud from Warner Bros. The best thing about suicide squad was Robbie's performance but this vehicle is a disservice to the potential that was there.

Overall an enjoyable film,"So I love Harley Quinn and was so excited to see this film and went it to it with high hopes. It did not disappoint. The cast was incredible, each portrayed their character so well, with a great deliverance on lines. Margot Robbie was absolutely hilarious, a truly entertaining Harley. Whoever played the villain did a fantastic job. The actress who played Dinah though is the one who really stood out to me well watching, Full House fans may recognize her as she appeared on the show as a child. The movie was a joy to watch and full of laugh, from the jokes, to the awesome fight scene the movie was overall enjoyable. What Keeps it from being great though is the fact that it's all over the place, which may be intentional since it's Harley who's telling the story, along with the fact that it's not exactly true to the comics but then again how often do comic adaptations stay true? Despite the movie being all over the place it was still quite easy to follow. If you're looking for a funny, girl power sort of movie I'd check it out.",7.0,12 February 2020

Worth a watch,"Wasn't sure I wanted to watch this but I must say I'm glad I did, Margot Robbie is great as Harley Quinn as she was in the Suicide Squad and the other characters are also good. Not much of a storyline but a harmless fun film, give it a go",7.0,7 February 2021
Wow how bad is this movie,"I'm all for female lead role's in blockbuster movies, I'm even up for more nearly full female cast movies but this film is just bad , badly written, bad acting , the Cariography is terrible you can see that the punches kicks are not landing and telegraphed. Even the main character harley has completely changed in personality from the suicide squad movie , the plot was obvious and the ending predictable. To get a diverse cast they missed the most important part of a movie the acting and writting , trying to hard to tick boxes instead of giving the viewer what they have paid for entertainment!! I have nothing good to say about this movie its just terrible do not waste your time watching.",2.0,5 February 2023

"Pushing the ""agenda"" the right way","I don't get the negative reviews at all ! great movie with really beautiful john wick type action sequences but not as over the top as john wick. i'm a guy and i LOVED this film. my only complaint is that there isn't a lot of black mask in the film but it's not a dealbreaker. Lately, we've gotten the ""agenda"" pushed heavily onto us, in some cases (captain marvel) it's been forced and BOP is obviously in the same lane but it is done so tastefully and masterfully. margot robbie is a phenomenal actress, she absolutely nails the part and so do all the other beautiful women in this film. do yourself a favor and watch it, it's got great humor that isn't forced and really top notch action sequences.",7.0,7 February 2020
"Boring, dull and just not interesting at all","Greetings from Lithuania.

""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" (2020) movie was as ridiculous as its title. Besides of some action scenes, this movie was boring, bland, not funny and simply snooze fest. I forced myself into watching it during a whole week, like 10 min per day because it was highly uninvolving little flick. The script here is poor, there was nothing that resembled a interesting plot.

Overall, just like ""Suicide Squad"" this movie did not worked at all. DC really needs to start hiring real talents behind the camera because if they will continue this way, soon there won't be many viewers.",5.0,29 August 2020
I had so much fun watching this.... I had to give it a 10,"Firstly, if you haven't seen this yet, but partied your way through the first ""Kick Arse"" movie, watch this ASAP.

During Suicide Squad, as a man, I was somewhat distracted by Harley Quinn's outfit..... etc. I must admit that I came here, expecting something similar. This time though, none of the women were overtly sexualised, and that was a good choice.

What was presented was a fun filled carnival ride of over the top action and girl power fun. There were so many whoooo laughter moments, and smart arse dialogue, that ramped up to a crescendo. The imagined scenery was fantastic, perfectly suited to the comic strip story, and the final battle was played out in the perfect arena.

For those that can't accept female heroines beating up on male villains..... grow up and get over it. For those that can..... let the inner child out, revel in it, and enjoy the ride.",10.0,16 September 2020
Honestly entertained,"I went into this movie not expecting much since suicide squad was such a mess but, I heard the action was good an I've always been a fan of Harley (comics and otherwise) so I gave it a shot. Honestly not a bad movie. I didnt get a sense of 'men are bad' the men in this movie happen to be villains...so? The villains in most movies are men whats the problem? I know people are going to complain about the ""men taking credit for womans work"" story line but, really you can think of it as a coworker or boss getting credit for something you do which we all can relate to. So, no I don't think this ""feminist"" aspect was beaten into your skull but yea it is there.

The action scenes were some of the best choreographed in these types of movies.

Only complaint really is the story can get alil messy but it was trying to do alot in a short period of time and its never messy to the point where you cant follow it or the decisions characters make. I definitely recommend this movie.",7.0,19 August 2020
A New Low,"It is a heavy statement to say that a film is one of the worst in the DCEU, but this one may very well take the cake. Its problems start and end with the writing. The structure was all over the place and none of the jokes landed. However, the worst aspect was the performances in relation to the writing. Good performances within the context of good characters (Messina's Zsasz, Winstead's Huntress) were horribly under utilized, while atrocious performances (Perez, Wong, Basco) seemed to hog all the screen time. To say that those three were poorly cast would be an understatement. I have directed grade-school actors that could sell a character better than them. Not to mention that Robbie made an obnoxious mess of herself in an attempt to be fun, Smollett-Bell's Black Canary had an absurd twist that contributed to the product's overall inconsistencies, and McGregor's wonderfully hammy eccentricities were diminished by a shoehorned in evilness that never served the plot other than to make him into the ""sleazy white misogynist"" stereotype.

In fact, nothing about this movie seemed to serve the plot. Critics are drooling over the ""girl power"" politics, but it was way too on-the-nose. It would have been unneeded if they took a lesson from cinema's more iconic female-lead action films, such as Kill Bill, Terminator, and Alien. Just let the themes speak for themselves. If it was meant to happen, it will happen naturally. An objectively good story trumps a subjectively preachy message any day, and the product will ultimately better withstand the test of time. Hopefully the poor box office outcome will drill that into the minds of these filmmakers, as absolutely nothing worked in this movie. Nothing at all.

The costumes were ugly and impractical, the effects were unfinished, the action scenes had inconsistent physics and logic, the editing was distracting. I could continue, but we would be here all day. Just...shame, shame on all of you.",3.0,14 January 2023

Birds of Prey,"Continues a wining-ish streak for DC with a pretty solid film that is at the very least WAY better than Suicide Squad. It's messy as hell, at times crassly mean-spirited, and mostly not that funny, but for the most part it's still a great deal of fun. Harley is still a fun character, and this version of her that is more than just an oversexualized girlfriend of the Joker is a much more interesting character to follow. Her girl gang and resentful breakup is also just a very human story. Yeah it was done better in the animated series currently on DC Universe, but still, this one is fun. The other Birds are pretty good, especially Huntress, but this really is Harley's show, and she's good. I do have to give love to Ewan McGregor as Black Mask. Yeah he's done villains before, but good god, this is one helluva villain. I love the character Black Mask, and he absolutely nails the character. Charming, funny, completely psychotic, I was a happy geek watching him on screen. Not to mention McGregor is clearly having a ball in the roll, and that energy does pass on to you. Overall though Birds of Prey is a mess. It's plot is basically Snatch but not as good, and it's attitude is aggressive, but god damn does it ever have an attitude. It has an identity, a style, and a look I can't deny, and I will admit it was pretty fun. It's got some solid performances, characters I wanted to see, and a solid style. It's a wild swing, and while it doesn't totally nail it, I admire it's ambition.",,22 March 2020

I wish DC didnt ruin this title and these characters,"Birds of Prey (2020) is a movie we saw in theatres shortly after it came out. The storyline focuses on Harley Quinn post Suicide Squad after she breaks up with the Joker, recovers from her depression from the breakup, and starts a new life of crime with a new crew of thieves known as Birds of Prey. A lunatic is not a fan of her work and sets out to hunt her and her crew down and bring them to their demise. This movie is directed by Cathy Yan (Dead Pigs) and stars Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad), Rosie Perez (White Men Can't Jump), Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting) and Jurnee Smollett (Lovecraft Country). The storyline for this is a huge step down from Suicide Squad and maybe the worst DC movie to date. The film tried to be cool and creative but everything from the title, storyline and premise was delivered poorly, which is too bad because the cast had potential, the writing and execution failed the potential though. Birds of Prey is a great DC storyline...but that team was created and led by Barbara Gordon, so why use that premise, remove Barbara and insert Harley Quinn, and think you'll be fine? Easy, to capitalize on the money from Suicide Squad. Unfortunately, it didnt work. I wouldn't recommend watching this and I wish DC didnt ruin this title and these characters (who are actually very good). I'd score this a 3/10 and recommend skipping it.",3.0,26 June 2021
Maybe watch it first before reviewing it,"It's more of a 7/10 movie to be honest, but as someone who actually saw this film and is a huge comic book fan I am so tired of these nonsense reviews from people who don't know what they are talking about so I'm scoring it higher then I normally would. This is a descent movie, it's fun and has some great fight sequences. Is it perfect? Of course not! No comic book film will ever live up to every fans expectations, that's just not possible. So calm down, take a friend and give this silly movie a watch.

Margot did a good job with the budget she was given, it's a fun ride with descent acting and great action scenes.

If you're looking for a fun movie to escape your messy life for a couple hours then give this Movie a try.

Forgettable Harley Quinn Movie,"The movie is not that bad, but to be honest...it's a movie about Harley, everyone else, pale in front of her.

I knew, that there will be feminism, but the whole movie is about feminism, which IMO is too much.

I would categorize the movie as DC's version of ""Deadpool"", but it won't be quite accurate. It must be seen to be understand.

There are some pretty creative approaches, some not so much. The story is not very impressive, but I think it's expected, nothing really special.

Black Mask got exactly one comicbook scene...kinda. Everything else about him was just...strange.

The action is probably the best part of the movie.

The music somehow fits into the overall atmosphere, there're 2-3 strikes.

Considering that I was expecting to be a total waste of time, I can say it was boring, but not disappointing as ""Suicide Squad"". I would say, that it's forgettable Harley Quinn movie at best.",6.0,5 February 2020

"A fast-paced, violent, and sometimes disjointed follow-up with varying degrees of entertainment value","Birds Of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is a superhero film based on the DC Comics team of the same name and a sequel/spin-off to 2016's Suicide Squad. Starring Margot Robbie in the lead role as Harley Quinn, it is a fast-paced, violent, and sometimes disjointed follow-up with varying degrees of entertainment value.

Sometime after the events of Suicide Squad, the Joker and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) have since ended their relationship, resulting in the latter being forced to fend for herself out on the streets of Gotham City. After spending a night at a fancy club, Harley attracts the attention of its owner Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), a sadistic crime lord who holds a high position of power over the entire city. In exchange for her life, Roman tasks Harley with tracking down a young girl named Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), who has pickpocketed an important diamond containing crucial information that will further his influence. Upon finding Cassandra, Harley decides that the two of them should team up with fellow heroes Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), and Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) to defeat Roman and finally bring an end to his reign of terror.

With a noticeably more grounded approach to its source material, Birds of Prey is an exhausting but fun improvement over its predecessor in more ways than less, despite displaying some of the same issues. Unlike the preceding film, this one feels free from the confines of a PG-13 rating and ups the ante with its frequent use of strong violence and swearing. I can't help but feel that Suicide Squad would have been a better film had it taken this approach instead of playing it safe. By making Harley Quinn the sole main character, the film at least has one person to guide the audience through the story as opposed to multiple people each dealing with their own individual problems. With that said, the film attempts to implement Harley's anarchic mindset into its storytelling throughout the first and second acts, which proves problematic when trying to establish what her motivations are and why we should care at all. I do understand that Harley is supposed to be a mentally broken person with an unpredictable streak, but I felt that this did not gel well in the film's favour, as it only ends up making it seem more unsure of itself, overwhelming the viewer in the process. In spite of this, it is still nonetheless interesting to see inside the head of such an iconic character and watching how she deals with a breakup in her own unique ways.

Director Cathy Yan continues Suicide Squad's style of brightly-coloured set pieces and a matching frenetic soundtrack to show off a more wild side to Gotham City we don't often get to see. This approach gives the film an almost music-video type feeling, especially with its song choices. For example, one scene features ""Black Betty"" as covered by the Australian hard rock band Spiderbait as Harley fights her way through multiple hired goons in a police station. It is highly likely that Margot Robbie, being an Aussie herself, chose this rendition of the song as it suits the scene better than the original. Moments like this show how Yan and Robbie must have gotten on so well during filming, especially since the latter is also credited as an executive producer.

Even though Suicide Squad was poorly received by many, myself included, most will agree that Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn was a major highlight (even earning praise from the character's co-creator Paul Dini) and the same can be said about this outing. There is plenty to enjoy in seeing Harley wreak havoc upon members of Gotham's crime syndicate with little care for the enemies she is making in the process. Robbie brings that much needed spark of madness to her character, constantly reminding the audience that she is still technically a villain in spite of her attempts at a good deed. In addition to this, Ewan McGregor is quite jarring to watch as the film's main antagonist, considering this is one of the rare times he has played a bad guy. Unfortunately, I feel that the remaining members of the titular Birds of Prey were somewhat underused, not leaving much of an impression until the final act. If a sequel is ever greenlit, hopefully they will be given more screen-time.

In conclusion, while the film doesn't break too much new ground for the DC Extended Universe, fans of Harley Quinn and Robbie's performance should be greatly entertained. However, anyone who hated Suicide Squad will likely feel the same way about this film, as apart from the addition of graphic violence and profanity, there is not much else new worth recommending that would change their minds. While not quite a post-credits scene, there is a small amusing Easter egg that those who chose to stay back may smile at.

"Completely Bizarre Yet Stylish and Well Acted , DC Goes All Out With Birds of Prey","Some movies decide to bring you along slowly, they setup the plot and bring you in by introducing you to the key players. Other movies kick the door open and grab you to take you along for the ride. Birds of Prey is decidedly one of the latter cases. We begin with an animated intro being narrated by Harley (Margot Robbie) where the audience is showered with cursing, violence and frenetic jokes. This was disarming for me and it helped me start laughing right off the bat. Its an odd choice to be sure but this isn't a movie that's ashamed or trying to hide what it is and I respected that choice. It also introduces the visual sensibility of the movie. It borrows from Suicide Squad but they do a good job cherry picking what worked from that movie and they leave behind the less desirable parts. The character cards are back with a couple of twists and the world is decidedly grimy and less glamorous which was a nice change of setting.

My favourite aspect of the movie was the script, there's enough story to establish stakes and provide our characters with a common goal. Then the roller coaster picks up speed and we hit the ground running. The dialogue is quick and full of moments that left me chuckling or outright laughing, the emphasis is on a more realistic endgame instead of the end of the world (something that I've been beating a drum about whenever we get a superhero film) and the character intros have a nice mix of cool backstory but they take the time to show us what they're capable of and what they're about. It perfectly embodies Harley's nature (crazy, funny but you can't turn away) and screenwriter Christina Hodson deserves more kudos for her work.

There are serious moments in Birds of Prey but there's more emphasis on the action and comedy. The action scenes here are memorable and they hold their own despite this not being a top dollar budget kind of blockbuster (the budget is still high at around 85 million but when you put that up against the Avengers movies, doesn't seem so big eh?). They aren't carbon copies, there's a dream sequence that's part action setpiece and musical number that felt like somebody slipped me something and the scene in the police station is so unconventional because they weave the narrative structure into how the scene plays out. They kept me engaged and it was also nice to be dealing with heroes that didn't have to rely on super powers and could really hold their own based on physical prowess.

As much as this is pitched as an ensemble (it really isn't but I digress) Robbie is the star of the show and she proves that her fan favourite work in Suicide Squad wasn't a fluke. This isn't a dignified or glamorous role, much like her work as Tonya Harding, she gets into the uglier side of the character. Harley's really fun for a few seconds and then she'll do something disappointing or shocking and because of Robbie's work, she becomes a more well rounded character. She captures Harley's enigmatic nature and this is a triumph for her. If there's someone who really caught my attention other than our lead it was Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary. She not only looked the part but she had the tough attitude and the vulnerability all wrapped up into one. I had only seen her in Temptation (which I also liked her in but the movie sucked overall) but she was excellent here and I hope we get to see more of her again in this role soon. Rosie Perez and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were both solid, they were the supporting players in the crew but they each got their moments (more on Winstead later). I was so sure going in I was going to hate Cassandra Cain as a character but Ella Jay Basco hit the right notes and I thought she worked well with the rest of the cast. Kid characters get annoying fast when they're not done right and she was a good addition to this group. I want to credit Chris Messina as a pitch perfect Victor Zsasz but I also have to talk about our antagonist Roman Sionis played by Ewan McGregor. This is a weird performance by Ewan, he's so off-kilter and his tone changes from scene to scene. He's a great actor and he won me over but I had a hard time getting a handle on what he was trying to do. But I still think he did a good job overall.

The strengths of Birds of Prey shine so brightly that it helped me look past a couple of things that bothered me. The movie does start to lose a little momentum at the 3/4 point, its pace had been very frenetic and breezy but when the emotional stakes come in, they hit the breaks a little too hard. I liked the character of Huntress and Winstead's performance but we could have used more time with her, she could almost have been cut out of the movie. I also didn't like the score, the musical choices were very obvious and while I like that style of music, the movie featuring so many classic rock/pop hits made the music feel more generic next to the rest of the movie.

This movie isn't a perfect package and while I did walk away with notes and criticism but I was so happy leaving the theatre. Birds of Prey doesn't just break away from the rest of the DC Universe, it blazes a brand new trail. It has more in common with Doom Patrol and Deadpool than Batman v Superman or Aquaman and it was so refreshing and unafraid to switch things up. Robbie throws herself into Harley, the plot shifts constantly and keeps you guessing, the action holds up and our heroine's zany humour is not only plentiful but brilliantly successful. As much as Margot deserves credit, Prey's MVP is screenwriter Christina Hodson who delivers a bonkers script that throws curve after curve (along with some solid comedic dialogue) and when paired with Yan's direction, Birds of Prey is a home run. Purists may have issues with the representation of a couple of the characters but I don't have that background. I'm happy to give Birds of Prey an 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9/10. I would absolutely recommend checking this out in the theatre, this kind of entry in the genre is the best way to fight superhero blockbuster fatigue. My message to the executives is that if you want people to keep showing up to see the big comic book movies, we need different and daring films which Birds of Prey is unabashedly so.",9.0,7 February 2020

Better than 'Suicide Squad'... Barely,"Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor are good, the rest of the cast is pretty forgettable. 'Birds of Prey' was still a bit of a mess, but I see what it was trying to do and it had a goal. It was trying to be edgy, colourful, and filled with violent fun, but It's no 'Deadpool'. I would give this somewhere around a 6.7/10, so I was generous and rounded up. 'Suicide Squad' was just lost throughout and felt thrown together with some cool characters. This was able to take one of the more interesting characters, that being Harley Quinn and expanded on her persona.

Seems to be a lot of hate towards this film. A lot of people calling it a social justice girl power flick. I mean, sure if that's how you choose to see it that's all you're gonna see as I won't deny there is definitely a component of that throughout. Just remember it's 2020, and that is the current trend, especially since the world has been fighting for equality, so of course there is going to be movies like this. It's to be expected, so relax.

Mista J was a Big Fat Meanie: The Movie,"Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn is as ridiculous as it sounds, but Harley Quinn is quite the ridiculous character herself. For the most part, the DC Extended Universe has been largely hit or miss. Since its inception, it has always felt like an on-the-whim pop culture reaction to get on board with the way that other studios are heading. The DCEU has never felt like it simmered in long-term development and planning to create one cohesive ""extended universe"" across multiple films. That is one of the many reasons why, with eight films under its belt, it has not been met with critical success and box office records like the far more visionary and cohesive MCU. The once area where Warner/DC succeeded is in casting. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Henry Cavill as Superman, and, yes, Margot Robbie as one Harley Quinn.

Margot Robbie was born for this role. She is the perfect Harley Quin, down to the mannerisms, and quirky spunk, and certainly the voice affectations that I'm more than convinced were inspired by Harley's Batman: The Animated Series personification. While 2016's Suicide Squad was an abysmal failure (for far too many reasons to mention here), it did shine the spotlight on Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn who did a superb job in her role. Now, here, in Birds of Prey, she resumes that role in what is considered a spiritual sequel to the Suicide Squad of 2016 (note that Margot Robbie will reappear as Harley Quinn in James Gunn's reboot of The Suicide Squad in 2021).

Birds of Prey begins with a time jump into the future after the events of Suicide Squad by explaining the outcome of Jared Leto's Joker and Robbie's Harley. While a few brief flashback scenes depict what transpired between Joker and Harley, with the implication that this is the same Joker from Suicide Squad, Jared Leto does not appear in this film (He is reportedly done with this role following a fallout with Warner/DC over Todd Phillips' Joker film starring Joaquin Phoenix). Harley is recovering from her fallout with the Joker, which has left her vulnerable to retaliation from a wide assortment of Gotham City's seedy villains, one of whom is Roman Sionis...aka: The Black Mask played by Ewan McGregor. Sionis is a millionaire playboy who is connected to dark underworld Gotham City and lives a life of crime and violence. He's basically the evil version of Bruce Wayne. McGregor is fantastic in his role but his character suffers from a lack of proper development and his placement as the films ultimate villain is a little under-whelming. The lack of character development seems too widespread in this film. All the proper elements are there. In addition to McGregor's Roman Sionis/Black Mask, the film features veteran DC characters Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), The Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina), and Cassandra Cain. The problem is that none of these characters are fully developed, nor are their depictions accurate to the DC Batman stories. For instance, Black Canary is a lounge singer who, for some strange reason, has Bruce Lee-level martial arts skills but is incapable of standing up to Sionis who puts trust in her more than he should. Most of all though, the story revolves around a young pickpocket named Cassandra Cain who stole something that she should not have. DC fans should know that name very well. Cassandra Cain is Batwoman but here she's an awkward little girl living on the streets. Maybe the DCEU will develop her into a future on-screen role as Batwoman but I sincerely have my doubts. I suspect it's just a clever nod to the comic books; a not so subtle Easter egg if you will.

Overall, I think the film is very entertaining the opening sequence was just fantastic and a really great way to start the story. All of the characters were wonderfully cast. Rosie Perez was delightful as Montoya and Smollett-Bell, McGregor, Robbie, Messina, and Ella Jay Basco all deserve praise for their acting. I just think that this film could have spent a little more time in the writer's room and that Roman Sionis should have been much more menacing and threatening than what was depicted.",7.0,6 April 2020

One of DC's Better Films,"Overall, Birds of Prey is a decent action film from DC and it's no doubt one of their better films. The action was the clear standout in the film, some really well chereographed set pieces throughout. Margot Robbie as well really is the perfect Harley Quinn, she was humorous and what you would expect. However Ewan McGregor as Black Mask was a total mess and miscast in my eyes. He just didn't suit the role at all, his characteristics as an actor just didn't match the role from the start. A poor casting in my eyes. But I enjoyed this, it was an easy watch and I'd revisit it, which matters. Nothing special but still good.

Achieves What It Set Out To Do,"There are basically 3 ways to approach a film about comic book characters. You can try to ground it in reality as much as possible; ie, ""The Joker."" You can use science fiction to explain superpowers; ie, ""The Antman,"" ""Captain America,"" etc. Or you can lean into the cartoony unrealistic nature of the original medium, which is what this film does. This has a Tarrantino-like sensibility combined with the 1960s Batman TV show. (All the fight in the funhouse lacks is big cartoon ""Pows!"" and ""Whams!"") And since Harley Quinn started in the Batman cartoons and not the comic book, this live action cartoon is perfect for her. Robbie commits to her character as usual. If you find gleeful over-the-top violence committed by morally questionable people led by a deeply silly but fun-loving sociopath entertaining, you will enjoy this film.

Movie is suppose to be a superhero team spoof, but so shallow flat I actually ended up not caring - just waiting for it to end. 2. 50% of screen time is like a fashion show catwalk of Robbie & her sometimes being cute by staring at the camera; just dumb & boring. Another 25% was showcasing how non-conforming her character could be which did not come across as real - actually it was comic book real. 3. Action scenes were 90% very poorly executed flying kicks & arm takedowns that a 10 year old could perform better. 4. Both dialogue & music lyrics were heavy on the obscenities; a cheap way to fake toughness. 5.

"A fun, although slightly unoriginal, blast","With some great, all out performances, and a sheer sense of fun energy; Birds of Prey makes for an entertaining comic book film that may not be totally original, but is certainly different from the rest. The film's script can be a bit average at times, containing plot points you have certainly seen before, however, where Birds of Prey shines most is its unique sense of storytelling and the ridiculously entertaining things it does with it. Margot Robbie give a 'fabulous' performance as Harley Quinn, removing all my doubts of her playing the famous character after Suicide Squad. The other women in the film also give some great performances, with the greatest stand out being Mary Elizabeth Winstead who steals every ounce of her screen time, bringing her A-game as always. Ewan McGregor also gives a fun filled performance as the film's titular villain Black Mask. The film is filled with absolutely awesome action sequences that are bound to at least put a grin on your face, and if that doesn't, then the large dose of well-timed humor will certainly do the trick. In the end, Birds of Prey isn't the best DC has had to offer, but it is certainly a blast, and certainly an experience unlike any other. My Rating: 9.25/10",10.0,7 February 2020

I just take it as mindless piece of action entertainment and it really doesn't fail there; I even had a few good laughs throughout. As a trained fighter I almost never find fight scenes well done in movies and even though they're far from perfect here, I was actually impressed how well choreographed they were; maybe not convincing,but the style fits the overall movie.

"Hey, it's entertaining and colorful comic book movie","I found ""Suicide Squad"" to be wasted potential with a cool gallery of characters but who were not used to do much interesting. I expected this one to be even worse but I was actually surprised: it's better!

Yes! They did it! They fixed what was the biggest issue in the previous one. The supernatural fantasy villains have been thrown to garbage and this time Harley has actual thugs to fight with her club. What bugged me a little bit was that she is a bit too invincible in regular fights. I get that she's supposed to be very fast and acrobatic but the way she just beats up a room full of guys is a maybe a bit too unrealistic, even for a comic book logic. Still...I iked this movie's action scenes more than Marvel's ""digital guys punching each other through digital walls"" style.

The other characters, the so called ""Birds of Prey"" are a nice addition, though I think they don't deserve to be the main title of the film. They are clearly side characters. Still, I liked them. Black Canary and Huntress don't show up very often but they are acted pretty well and seem to have some personality.

Then there's the quirky humor that is all over the place. I understand if someone can't stand it. It irritated me in the beginning but then I got into the mood and had many laughs. The comedy managed to be actually funny.

What I also disliked at first is how the story is told in fragments, which seemed confusing at first. I don't know was that really necessary but...ok...in the end it worked I guess. Maybe it's suppoded to represent Harley Quinn's chaotic personality.

One more thing: the movie is quite colorful. Unlike Christopher Nolan's ""let's make Batman look realistic (= boring)"" visual style, I think Birds of Prey is more like what a comic book movie should visually look like.

I'd put this movie in the same pile as ""Batman & Robin"" and ""Turtles 2: The Secret of the Ooze"". I mean, I actually like those, I find them entertaining and like to watch from time to time.",5.0,21 July 2021
Simple but original and entertaining,"It's not the best superhero movie, but it doesn't have to be, it just meets what it claims. Its plot is simple, but original for the genre, which needs variety. Harley Quinn takes the film and the rest of the cast has every perfect moment to shine, although they should have had something else. It is realistic and its photography together with the production design is very striking and original. Ewan McGregor is perfect although he would have given more prominence. Huntress and Black Canary are very interesting, although they lack screen time. It is full of action which is very good and well choreographed, and each character has his battle style. The rhythm of a moment is boring. In conclusion it fulfills what it intends, it is entertaining and novel, I hope DC explores these characters more and the superhero cinema fills its ranks with more heroines.",8.0,13 February 2020

Fantabulous addition to the DCEU,"12 hours removed from viewing DCEU newest title and while there are a few 'flaw's, this movie is a very colorful and fantabulous ode to one, Harley Quinn.

I won't get into the poor reviews from others. To be honest, I don't see where any one of them are accurate. I am a big fan of the Gotham universe and right away, I could pick up references from DC's New 52 line; Harley Quinn: Hot in the City Voume 1 (I prefer graphic novels over comics) and found myself submersed in her world.

The fourth wall narrating didn't do it for me, but I wouldn't call it a complete mess or disaster. I just found it didn't complement the movie in it's entirety.

Harley Quinn; I would love to see someone argue a better casting than Margot. She's something special and pays homage to the character beautifully. I read a post that said she is 'dangerous and deranged' but it wasn't displayed. I beg to differ. She was completely compulsive and displayed maniacal behaviours.

Roman Sionis; Ewan McGregor... well there is something sinister about him that works well. The 'fight or flight' displayed is how I image it when reading graphic novels.

Supporting cast also worked well to complement the visions and direction of Cathy Yan.

Verdict; while the beginning isn't my first preference of submersing viewers into the on screen world, Birds of Prey: and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn is a fun fast paced, whack'em with your hammer kind of movie. My only wish is that we would stop with the labelling of this movie and see it for its core purpose: entertainment.",8.0,12 February 2020

"Not one of DC's best films, but very entertaining","This is a very fun action movie that is better than Suicide Squad (not trying to compare). But there are issues that I have with this movie.

Pros: Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor do amazing with their roles and they clearly are having a great time in this movie. The action sequences are well utilized and the vibrance works well with action as well as the charisma that Harley Quinn brings out. Harley Quinn has better one-liners and character background. This is also an incredibly shot action movie and is well directed. It seems to take its time with the story and doesn't feel rushed in order to go with the fun action-packed scenes which was amazing. And the humor in this was very enjoyable and made me laugh a bit. Since this is a Harley Quinn movie, it's lighthearted, colorful, and has clever written ideas about her.

Cons: When I mean it's a Harley Quinn movie, I mean that the movie title should be just called ""Harley Quinn featuring Birds of Prey"" because its mostly focused on her and the Birds of Prey don't team up until the climax. And the characterization is kind of all over the place. Harley Quinn, Cassandra Cain, and Black Canary seem to be the only characters that have character background. Even though Ewan McGregor did excellent as Black Mask, I didn't really get to know that much about his villain origins and only got to see him be scary and cruel. Huntress felt underused had a few flashback scenes that didn't really work for me. For the acting I thought it was solid, but when it comes to Chris Messina (Victor Zsasz), I just couldn't handle him because I think he was miscast and overacted way too much. And I won't lie, the summary of the movie is very cliché especially for an action movie.

I can see why there are mixed reviews for this but I would have to say this is an awesome movie with great performances, action scenes, and great directing.",7.0,22 February 2020
Best Movie in the Current DC Universe,"Thoroughly enjoyed this one, my main takeaway was Roman Sionis. I expected that he would just be a filler villain with little depth while Harley takes most of the screen time, but I was wrong. His twisted personality was in full force and earned the R rating. They even included his germ phobia with the gloves. Honestly he might be the best villain since Zod.

Action sequences were incredibly fun and the pacing was good. I would have preferred a more linear story with this type of movie but the back and forth wasn't too distracting.

This doesn't even feel like a superhero movie, more like an uplifting crime drama. Does that make sense? I can see people watching this after a break up and feel better having seen it. Harley's pain is shown well and you can't help but connect with her.

If you love Harley Quinn this is a can't miss as her character is given the needed depth that was so lacking in Suicide Squad. The other supporting ladies also shine in their limited roles.",7.0,9 February 2020

Her voice work seemed off & body language seemed restricted & constrained. I felt I got what the director & writer had in their imagination, but it wasn't what came out. The BEST THING about this movie was Mary Elizabeth Winstead's appearance and performance. Evan McGregor was flawless too. Other than them, it felt like every character was under utilized. Most scenes were either hurried or trimmed abruptly. Music at some places was really good and really boring at others. Imo, the points where music was very good needed to be louder. Action didn't excite too much and the props used for that seemed to come out of nowhere. This team had tremendous potential if the story could have been told differently and action scenes were tweaked at some places. With some more inter character tension, this could have been a blockbuster. Hate to say this, but highly disappointing.",2.0,10 February 2020

mostly fine,"Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) has daddy issues and relationship problems. She gets dumped by the Joker. In a reckless explosive gesture, she reveals her split to the world. Without Joker's protection, all of her enemies including psychopath kingpin Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor) come out for her head. She is also hounded by police detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez). The situation gets even more chaotic when the Bertinelli diamond gets stolen by pickpocket Cassandra Cain. It's the key to the Bertinelli crime family fortune. Helena Bertinelli (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is the last surviving member and she kills with a crossbow. Dinah Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) is a nightclub singer and secretly the Black Canary.

Mostly, I like this. I don't give a damn about Birds of Prey. This is a Harley Quinn movie and should be straight up about her. The title should be about her. The movie can introduce Birds of Prey at the end but it should be all Harley all the time. I'm fully into it up to the color splatter gunfight at the police station. For some reason, the movie decides to go back a week. I don't think it's necessary. Those bits should be simply incorporated into the introductory section. It's a speed bump in the story and this movie has a couple of those. On top of it all, the cinematic style needs some Edgar Wright. It already has the bright colors and manic ideas. Margot is doing some crazy accent. With some Wright stylistic touches, this would really work. This is a fine Harley Quinn movie but it's not much for the others.",6.0,3 April 2020

I loved Birds of Prey. It is Fantabulous!,"I loved Birds of Prey. It is Fantabulous 😊 It is brash, colourful, violent, silly, comic, and at the same time has pathos and is emancipating.

Pretty solid and I want to see more,"Birds of Prey is still a great nature documentary. Darn it, I did it again. It's actually a fun movie that feels like a comic book, bright colors, great visuals and nice violent action. The cast and characters have great chemistry and Margot Robbie is finally growing on me as Harley Quinn. Compared to Suicide Squad, this one doesn't feel like a cluster bomb of footage that's scattered around and doesn't go anywhere. Quinn feels like Quinn and the action is a lot of fun and well choreographed. The movie does take a good note from Suicide Squad as to how weird Gotham City is, and just how weirder it's inhabitants can be. There's fun violence and action and though it might bore some people in the year by jumping around a lot, it's more cohesive than a lot of other films. We're looking at the soft reboot of Suicide Squad and it's much more of a film to champion nowadays. Robbie is easily the best thing in it, but the whole cast is fun and play off each other very well. Ewan McGregor is so much fun as the villain and he's having fun with it. There's a lot of good character details that stay true to the comics, and it's good to see some new characters get the spotlight. It takes a second viewing to really appreciate it and hopefully they make a sequel, which would be a lot of fun to see. It's the new Deadpool movie, just with more Harley Quinn, and it works just fine.",6.0,2 September 2020
hat a waste of a great comic AND previous movies,"I love the Harley Quinn character portrayed in the last decade's comic books and graphic novels. I totally dig the first Suicide Squad movie and the second one wasn't... terrible. This movie is not for someone who appreciates these things. How can you have a Birds of Prey w/o Batgirl/Oracle? The Cassie Cain character is not remotely a character as she is supposed to be. Sad. Didn't like it, despite occasional good scenes. Worth one watch for fans.",3.0,29 June 2022

Pulp Fiction Meets Deadpool,"Although I had slightly higher expectations, seeing all the praise on how the action is like John Wick's or how it is very similar to Deadpool, I still find this to be a great movie. The action isn't as near as John Wick's but aren't cheap quick shots that many action fight scenes love to do to save time; It was very much like Pulp Fiction and Deadpool, a narrator narrating different pieces of the story for different characters not so much in chronological order; but this movie doesn't catch as much of the humor that Deadpool had to offer(not to say that's a bad thing). The style of the movie reminded me of Suicide Squad, with it's colorful appeal and all, and the acting was fantabulous. Deserves a 7.4/10 IMDb, 85 percent Rotten Tomatoes, 70 percent MetaCritic.",7.0,9 February 2020
"Some good, some bad. Somewhat forced at times.","It was ok. It looks pretty good, good use of music. Entertaining, and not really a dull moment. However, a little all over the place.. some of the girlpower feels somewhat forced.

I'm sure a lot of haters gonna hate on it, and the woke twitterati will love it, and those who are in the middel will probably think the same as I.

It has some pretty darn cool action scenes, but also some of the action felt uninspired. And, and this is not meant as hate, but not all the fighting is believable. You get no reason why these chicks kick so much ass, and they really do. You know, one swift kick and bad guy (twice the size of the hero) goes down.

I just wish they would have taken the Atomic Blonde-approach. Women are smaller than men, with less muscle, so maybe have them hit 3 times, instead of one?

And how come Harley can beat up several big dudes alone, anyway? She's like, a psychologist? I don't know.

It is pretty brutal tho! I liked that.

Also, Harley Quinn just walks around town.. no cops or anything try to get her. That's a little strange, maybe. And, she's not really very likeable. The bad guy is sort of more likeable than her, and he's a pretty big douche so.. yeah.",6.0,5 February 2020
Horrible - we left the theatre,"Within just 3 minutes I hated this film. The highpitched voice of Margot Robbie (like Mickey Mouse) just constantly annoying, extreme violence without any need (faces of victims were cut off, leg bones broken by jumping on them etc. - all of that also within just the first 5 minutes of the flick), vomiting, snot, peeing ... it was as if the producers tried to 'shock', annoy and put off the viewers with as many cliches and generally annoying/disgusting/dehumanizing scenes possible. I asked my friends how they like the film - general shaking of heads. We decided that our time is too valuable to watch this crap, gave it 10 minutes more but than left.

Everything We Wanted and More,"After Suicide Squad split DC fans down the middle, one might've assumed that Harley Quinn's story in the DCEU was over. It wasn't.

Birds of Prey delivers a stunning new look at the DCEU. It's additions of Black Canary, Huntress, and Renée Montoya provide a new type of character develop that we've never seen in DC movies before. In addition to Black Mask, this badass team of superheroes provides a perfect blend of insanity, awkwardness, and that feeling of total badass you get from watching the team plow through Black Mask's entire army.

Of course, I couldn't close off this review without mentioning Margot Robbie's stellar performance as the siren herself. Nobody else could possibly pull off Harley like she does.",10.0,7 February 2020
Energetic and frenetic,"Margot Robbie is still great as Harley Quinn and gets more of an arc in this chaotic film. You can tell she is having fun in the role and her exuberance helps you enjoy the film more. Ewan McGregor is excellent as Black Mask, though I wish we had seen more of him wearing the mask. The rest of the Birds of Prey are good for the most part, if lacking in character development. Some of the writing and dialogue is shoddy at times, but Harley's unique fragmented storytelling makes up for some of this.

The balls-to-the-wall action is cartoonish to say the least, but it definitely fits the character and world. Birds of Prey isn't an amazing film, but it mostly succeeds and continues pushing the DCEU in a positive direction.",7.0,27 March 2020
"First half setup slog, 2nd half okay plot.","Birds of Prey is split into two halves that really just don't fit well together as a full movie. The first hour or so is setting up all of the characters. Harley gets the most of this time, but Black Canary , Renee Montoya and Cassie Cain each get shortened establishment. The 2nd half is where the movie finally starts it's plot, but one that just isnt that interesting.

The comedy is definitely going for a Deadpool-esque vibe. Although it never gets as raunchy as DP does. It's rarely as funny as it thinks it is.

The Huntress was probably the only funny aspect because of her self seriousness in contrast to the other wacky characters. She's a dark serious type hero, a Batman caricature of sorts. The bit about being initially called ""The Crossbow Killer"" is decently funny. It's sad that she's only really a major character in the last 1/4th of this movie.

The plot is really just a device to introduce the characters and tell Harley's story. It boils down to bad guy, Black Mask, is after a diamond with microscopic bank information etched in it, Harley and other mercenaries are sent to get it. This story doesn't actually kick in until the hour mark as Harley freeze frames and rewinds back to establishing Det. Montoya, Black Canary, and Cassandra Cain for the first hour literally just before the plot gets into gear. It just halts everything as now they want to make sure we really understand the non-Harley characters.

The action was lacking and uninspired as well. It relied way too much on slow-mo fights or just too much going on to really understand it all. You know you have a poorly made fight sequence when they decide to use slow motion on every punch or hit to make it seem cooler than it is.

I hate to compare it to Marvel and I'd like it to stand on it's own merits, but it comes off as a failed attempt at a Guardians crossed with Deadpool (which Suicide Squad was also a failed attempt at). It for sure could have taken a few notes from Guardians and how superbly well that movie set up the characters and got the plot into gear within the first 45 mins of that one.

Margot Robbie is still great despite the material, and I really enjoyed Mary Elizabeth Winatead's caricature of a super serious dark hero, but besides those this movie just isn't that interesting. It's just a mediocre imitation of two superhero formulas done much better before it.",5.0,6 February 2020
A glitter-colorful explosion of joy!,"Birds of Prey definitely a must-see! It gives a more detailed, and interesting take on Harley Quinn, compared to her character in Suicide Squad.

I Want More Robbie As Harley Quinn,"I just got out of a surprisingly packed screening of Birds Of Prey.

Disclosure, I'm not familiar with the comics, so I don't know if the character portrayal are accurate or not. BL k Madk for example, I do not know if this is his comic story arc or not

I knew going in it would be a girl power movie, as it's Birds Of Prey, but every man in this is a horrible, vile, misogynistic d*ck. Literally every male character is a would be rapist, sexist woman hater. You can have a girl power movie without making it a man hating one. And it's not really a Birds Of Prey movie either, It's a Harley Quinn movie. That out of the way...

What I liked about this movie is I love Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, what ever you hated about Suicide Squad, everyone pretty much agreed she was the best thing in it. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (so bad in Gemini Man) is good as Huntress, but she had the least screentime, I could watch an entire movie around the backstory shown briefly here she has the best arc. Her and Black Canary (Jurnee Sonnet-Bell) were the best characters after Harley Quinn.

It is well directed, the action is well shot, you can actually see what is going on, and it's choreographed well in long shots instead of lots of cut aways and no shaky cam. There are a lot of appendage breaks (the most I have seen since I did the Steven Seagal movie marathon) considering what happens to people in the movie, there is not a great deal of blood, although it's littered with F Bombs!!

There were some decent laughs, one in particular got a huge reaction in my screening, but I think it could have used a few more laughs.

Ewan McGregor is fine, he is having fun, but a little too over the top. Rosie Perez is bland and dull as the cop, her and Casandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco) for me were a waste of screentime. I'd have rather there screen time went to Black Canary and Huntress. Although Cain is integral to the plot, she is just a waste of screentime. She is also the worst movie pickpocket of all time.

There is no characterisation outside of Harley Quinn (she is the only one you actually care about) and Huntress, the main plot (retrieving a diamond) is nothing we have not seen before. I had some issues with the police raid, which was awesome, even if it does not make sense.

Some scenes from the trailers are not in the movie!! For example the scene where she says ""Boom"" and appears to headbutt someone is not there.

I think it will split the fans, you will either like it or hate it!! I'm pretty sure it's depiction of men will rub a lot of people up the wrong way. I can't say I disliked it, as I was entertained through out, because it was a fun movie, so I'm kind of on the fence, but I do think it will have decent rewatchability.",7.0,7 February 2020
So strong women or Harley centric?,"This movie failed on every level for me. The action scenes were somewhat decent, but the editing is on par with Suicide Squad at times. The story is told out of order, which would work if it had an interesting one. The portrayal of the characters was somewhat adequate, but the focus on Harley just showed how insecure this chick is about her career. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone with reasonable standards.",3.0,5 February 2020

"Not so Fantubulous, Harley Quinn","I thought the film was kind of meh. First of all the film kind of takes awhile to get to the main plot. We start off with basically a montage/narration of the stuff Harley is doing post-breakup. You get a Suicide Squad style of announcing the characters you're gonna meet. The movie evenually gets to a point where Harley shows up at a police station and then the narration basically goes ""I need to tell you how I ended up here"" and we go back in time to an earlier point in the film. This is the moment where I thought to myself ""This is seriously taking awhile to get to this film's meat and potatoes. Is there no way they could have streamlined this? So anyway, you eventually get all caught up and brought up back to the current timeline. Its also within the same police station sequence that has some bad fight choreography. Like the typical everyone stand back while the protagonist fights off everyone one by one lameness. There's also a scene where Harley gets hit in the head and has a Marilyn Monroe sequence and I thought ""Why?"". It ends nothing to the film. It's just filler. There was other stuff to, things you'll have to suspend disbelief over, stuff like that.

I also did not care for Ewan McGregor's character Black Mask. He was too cartoony. I mean, one might argue that Harley Quinn is pretty cartoony herself...but it works for her character. I just didnt find Black Mask to be threatening in any way. He was just silly. I was more disturbed by his right hand man played by Chris Messina. There wasn't really enough of Huntress for me to feel a connection to her. I thought Jurnee as Black Canary was good. I did really like Rosie Perez and felt like she was the second standout of the film for me. But of course Margot is the star of the film and she is really good at being Harley.

I dont think the film was totally bad. There were some stuff that genuinely made me laugh and smile. And I did really the scenes and action when they finally got all together to fight (though this is towards the end of the film).

But unfortunately moments dont really make a movie. Having some kick-ass moments or some funny lines doesnt really undo the pacing issues, some of the cringy dialogue and acting...and the very basic story. If Im being honest, I think this another miss on DC's list.",6.0,7 February 2020
Fantabulously Thrilling,"Ever watched a superhero that felt more like a wacky cartoon? Not to be mean of course, because the DC movie Birds of Prey turned out to be like that. Conceived by Margot Robbie, who played Harley Quinn in DC's most polarizing film to date, Suicide Squad, this film came right the heck out of nowhere and turned out to impress critics, although it didn't seem to win audiences over as much as a certain blue hedgehog did. Now that it's been half a year since its original theatrical run, I have to say. Out of all the DC movies out there, this one might be the most entertaining one of them all...depending on your preference that is.

The movie focuses on Harley Quinn as an unprotected vigilante after breaking up with the Joker. Among her enemies, like the narcissistic crime boss Roman Sionis and his right-hand man Victor Zsasz, Quinn becomes allies with three deadly women: Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya, in an effort to save a girl named Cassandra Cain from concealing a special diamond. Conceptually, one can expect the outcome from a mile away, as the story plays out like any other superhero revenge movie on a deadly mission. However, what makes the movie somewhat distinctive is its central theme of female empowerment, as each of the leads have their own reasons for wanting to take vengeance on bad guys. Aside from Harley being hunted by every thug around her, Montoya is a cynical cop who's barely respected for her accomplishments, Huntress has a hit list of all the evil men who ruined her childhood innocence, and Black Canary is practically a toy for Sionis, whom she works for. These motivations are what give the movie a biting edge that other superhero movies are yet to have, and they bite hard.

In terms of the tone, that's where the movie is at its most playful, with plenty of wacky shenanigans, stylistic dreamy fantasies and slapstick to make for one hell of a thrill ride. Sure, you also have to suffer through boring villain exposition and the more serious moments can be a little jumbled, but those moments fail to overshadow the excitement this movie elicits. Heck, the movie opens up with a cold opening showing Harley Quinn's origins in animated form produced at WB Animation, which can help recap the events from Suicide Squad to newcomers and just give the viewers thrilling eye candy. In addition to that, most of the acting is delightful, especially with Margot Robbie stealing the show as the charmingly annoying Harley, especially with all the ad-libbing and self aware narration she gives. Ewan McGregor is menacingly over the top as Sionis, Rosie Perez captures Montoya's suspicious behavior well whenever she's in a fit of paranoia, Mary Elizabeth Winstead acts as a good straight-person in the movie's nonsense, and Jurnee Smollet-Bell's sarcasm makes Black Canary a delight to watch.

Now with all of that said, if there is one thing that does hold this movie back from being perfect, it's that it plays for somewhat of a niche audience. This isn't to say the average Joe can't go in and watch the movie without having a good time, but considering how much it connects to the DCEU and for how bizarrely cartoony the movie is compared to some of the past installments, it could potentially throw people off who have moved past the days of upbeat wacky superheroes (as well as anger edgy Snyder-verse movies). Plus, if you're more familiar with the comics, then you may be thrown off that the Birds of Prey are overshadowed by Harley Quinn, who didn't even appear then, but again, that depends on your preference. Also, in terms of other complaints, some characters like Cassandra Cain, Ellen Yee and even Zsasz could have used a little more screen time to be at least a little more interesting, since the movie doesn't give them enough attention to be all that noteworthy, especially when one of them is pretty much reduced to a macguffin. Then again, there's always room for sequels, right?

Not gonna lie, had it not been for Shazam or even Joker, this might have been the biggest surprise of a DC movie in recent years. While Birds of Prey might not be for everybody, it has enough fun action and comedy, tough characters, thrilling visuals and Margot Robbie to stand on its own. If you're brand new to the live-action DC movies or you're less into comics than you are films, then I recommend giving this flick a watch. Not only is it bad to the bone, but it's probably the most fun I've seen in terms of powerful women movies in quite some time. Who's to say the boys get to have all the fun?",7.0,24 August 2020

This was actually quite entertaining...,"Granted, I must admit that my expectations for ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" were quite low, especially after the result that was ""Suicide Squad"". But still, I was given the chance to get to sit down and watch this movie, so of course I did.

And I must say that I found it to be in a league of its own, when compared to ""Suicide Squad"". ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" was enjoyable on a whole different level.

The story told in the movie was good, and writer Christina Hodson had really managed to create something entertaining and quite enjoyable here. And with director Cathy Yan at the wheel, the movie was brought safely into harbor.

There is a good amount of action, comedy and violence in the movie to make it fun and enjoyable, and it was actually something of a rollercoaster to sit through. I was especially impressed with the storytelling in the movie, how they jumped back and forth and managed to tie the movie so nicely together.

And the movie has a great character gallery as well. I love Margot Robbie in the lead as Harley Quinn. And she was joined alongside such talents as Rosie Perez (playing Renee Montoya) and Ewan McGregor (playing Roman Sionis) - to mention the most memorable in the movie. I was thrilled to see Ali Wong (playing Ellen Yee) making an appearance, just a shame her role wasn't bigger.

As I mentioned above, there is a good amount of violence in the movie. Actually, I was surprised with the level of violence and action, especially because it was quite graphic and very nicely executed on the screen. That was quite something for a movie such as this.

Visually, then there was nothing to point a finger at when watching ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"".

I am rating it a six out of ten stars. Color me blue, red and impressed. If you haven't seen ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" already, you should do so, even if you weren't a fan of ""Suicide Squad"".",6.0,8 March 2020

Action scenes are very well done. The story might be too simple and really not that complex but it was fun to watch.

Plus don't go in there expecting a birds of prey movie, this is basically a Harley Quinn movie with some side characters. I loved the fact that Harley Quinn was the main focus but I could see how some people wont like that.

It is weird to me that people see him as a villain but then Harley is not that great of a person either and she does most of what he does too. And you're supposed to root for her. It was just weird.

Entertaining,"Harley Quinn and the Joker have split up. This leaves Harley Quinn isolated as the Joker will no longer protect her. In this vulnerable state she inadvertently stumbles into a plot by crime lord Roman Sionis to become the most powerful person in Gotham City.

I guess this puts me in the minority but I enjoyed the Suicide Squad. Maybe it's because I generally don't like superhero movies and it seemed different to the standard formulaic stuff trundled out: more comedic, less serious, less super-powers mumbo jumbo. Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie, was a stand-out character in Suicide Squad so it is no surprise that she now has her own movie.

This film continues in the same vein as Suicide Squad: more comedic, no super-powers. Plot is reasonably interesting and there is a reasonable amount of character engagement. It does become a rather formulaic action movie towards the end, taking some of the lustre off proceedings.

Margot Robbie is, once again, great as Harley Quinn: wonderfully over-the-top, dynamic and funny. Ewan McGregor is excellent and almost steals the show as the villain, Roman Stoinis: great intensity. Good support by Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya and Jurnee Smollett as Black Canary.

The disappointment is Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress. She is a fine actress but here seems miscast, as her character just seems so lifeless and unengaging. It might not entirely be her fault though: Huntress's character isn't developed and is easily the least-formed of all the main characters. Her dialogue is quite badly written too.

There are some funny and fun scenes to be enjoyed.

What was bad:

The movie is split into 5 different stories. None of which are given time to develop.

Too many soap opera overly dramatic scenes out of no where.

Very anti man in general. Every decent person is female and every one is a man. So over the top.

I could not believe how poorly written some of this movie was. There was quite often no explanation to the events occurring. Where did she get that motorcycle?!

Every single fight scene had someone getting hit in the nuts. Every single one.

The movie had no idea what it's tone was supposed to be at times during the beginning. It kinda wanted to split the baby between suicide squad and deadpool. It does come into its own toward the end.

Margot Robbie really gets to shine here, playing a character she obviously cares about, and I think she's a riot. She's as lethal as she is wacky (case-in-point: her love affair with an egg sandwich). The action scenes are as ""comic book movie"" as it gets but they're all women laying waste to roomfuls of bad guys (read: a lot of fun); Ewan McGregor's clearly having a ball here as Roman Sionis, second-tier villain extraordinaire; and The Birds of Prey make a pretty good team that deserve a sequel (unlikely though that may be).

"I liked it, but I expected more..","I think the movie was hyped to the point that it couldn't live up to the expectations. I enjoyed it, but it was sometimes laggy and could also be a little confusion. The time jumps while Harley is telling her story can be jarring at times. I thought there would be more of the Birds of Prey as a group than just the final act of the movie. However, if there is a reason to see this movie it's the action/fight scenes. They are incredible. Very well done and some unexpected humor. Serious kudos to the fight choreographer and all the stunt people involved. Margo Robbie makes for a great Harley. (I had not seen Suicide Squad). I think they could do more movies with her character, but they need to tighten the story up in the future.",7.0,26 February 2020

A fun time.,"I thought Suicide Squad was a decent movie. And so did many others including Jeremy Jahns until they saw the other critics reviews then hopped on the bandwagon of hate to make themselves seem more prestigious. One of the things i liked from SS was Margot robbie as Harlequinn, which i think most would agree.

This is very much a harley quinn story so it feels a slight bit misleading to call it a BOP movie. Anyhow, i enjoyed the movie for what it was. It was a fun, colourful themed movie with some good action sequences. Margot is a lot of fun as harley and to be fair i could watch her all day.

The films plot is okay but doesnt make itself the forefront enough. There are little side bits going on at the same time which take away from the general idea of the movie.

Understandably one of the main concerns at the moment in cinema is representation. Representation matters - we have all heard this and although its prominant message should be to be inclusive, i can understand some critics annoyance of the way men are perceived in this movie. I think there may be one decent guy who 5 minutes later turns out to be a sellout. The rest are truly god awful. I take this with a pinch of salt however cos i imagine the purpose of the film is to show gang related scumbags and not the good side of gotham.

I liked the style of the film. However, looking at an overall big picture its hard within the DCEU to see where this would fit. Its hard to imagine Batfelck or even Lex Luthor having a conversation with Ewans Black mask. Also little side note, there should have been a backstory to Cassandra - without this i have no idea why we're supposed to root for the little thief? Atleast make her a bit charismatic ot humourous maybe..! Also, Huntress is severely underused to the point she didnt really fit into this movie.

The DCEU needs some serious work. However, i found this film to be a good overall fun themed movie. Good action scenes and a standout peformance again by Margot Robbie.",7.0,2 December 2020

The movie has personality but lacks substance,"One thing i will say, for most parts of the movie the cinematography is crisp and colourful. Following in the personality of Harley Quinn the cinematography aids to juicy action moments with flowery deaths and humorous exits.

Margot Robbie brings fun to the character and the right amount of cringe without overkill, the story on the otherhand struggles to stay on pace. Too many un-connected enteries without development, gloomy humour and cheesy dialog. The antagonist isn't even that bad until he acts like a d*ck half way through to show us that he is a bad guy.

The climax could have been made better it was a little on the shallow side, i preferred scenes from the first half of the movie than the second half.

Birds of a different feather!

Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie) has just split from her boyfriend ""The Joker"" so she has to spread her wings free and become a free girl! All of this is helped along by a cast of side characters like detective Renee Montoya, Huntress, and the sexy and beautiful black bra wearing Black Canary! However all are tied and wrapped up in a wild card subplot that involves defeating a crazy and sadistic crime lord in Roman Sionis(AKA ""Black Mask"") and underneath all of this lies the search for a diamond and teenager named Cass(Ella Jay Basco). Aside from all of this the film entertains with violence, action, bombs, and flashbacks that tell character story. Look at this as a bad ass female group as each fight crime and for their own way of life in a gleeful way The costumes are also an eye catch and the dialogue moves the film along well, so if a comic book fan open up to this picture as it's full of antiheroine glory.",9.0,9 February 2020
Totally enjoyable,"There was really only one scene early that I found too violent for my tastes, but for the most part I quite liked this movie.

Amongst The Better Entries In DC Extended Universe,"Featuring a new look, presenting some new faces & bursting with newfound energy, the 8th instalment in the DC Extended Universe is a welcome attempt by the studio to create a fresher, livelier & richly hued world that's in better sync with the gleefully manic & unabashedly freewheeling spirit of Harley Quinn. And though this modified approach works in the film's favour, much of it is undone by its muddled, incoherent script.

Directed by Cathy Yan, the film effortlessly manages to get the Maid of Mischief to shed her old skin and embrace her new persona, and this newly harvested appeal promises a good time ahead. However, the longer it goes on, the more it becomes clear that its slapdash style is simply an attempt to conceal the script shortcomings, be it the thinly sketched characters, disjointed narrative, poor dialogues or absence of spot-on chemistry.

However, the kinetic camerawork, vibrant colour palette, consistent dose of action, frenzied pace & a few strong performances do make the ride quite fun & amusing. Margot Robbie again steals the show with her inside-out rendition of Harley Quinn. Ewan McGregor is another standout, playing his narcissist villain role with finesse. The rest do a serviceable job with what they are given and they aren't given much. Still, Mary Elizabeth Winstead manages to impress.

Overall, Birds of Prey is amongst the better entries in DCEU and is championed by Margot Robbie's fantabulous input. Her passion & commitment to her role is madly infectious and it's impossible to imagine someone else pulling off Harley Quinn with such charisma & flair. A more refined script, smoother narrative flow & added depth to supporting characters would've yielded a better end result but for what it's worth, this intermittently entertaining & downright carefree flick is not too shabby. Go for it.",,24 March 2020

"Fun, if you leave your brain at the door","The fact that is quirky, with just female leads and female writer and director, is the reason why the film is fun. If you would try to gender-swap it, you would get Batman and Robin without the one-liners. It makes little sense, though. From the beginning to start it is one action fest of ass kicking, but no characters that one can care about, no strategy, almost no story. Ewan McGregor's villain is weak and the classic cardboard psycho, so the tension is not really there. His henchman gets more screen time and is more interesting. The main character is Harley Quinn, with the ""birds of prey"" as secondary characters that only show their worth at the very end and frankly have little bearing on the story until then. But I would argue that what made the film more fun was Ella Jay Basco's unapologetic little pocket thief character.

Bottom line: when the laws of physics are broken, men fall from a kick from a girl and girls get up and fight after being hit by a car and thrown into another. The film is guilty pleasure fun, but makes little sense overall.",7.0,7 March 2020
I was so disappointed,"The Harley Quinn character was a lot of fun and enjoyable to watch for the most part. She had moments where she was annoying but overall she was a lot of fun and I enjoyed her. That being said, this is my only positive about the movie. Every other character was either very boring and had nothing going on for them, or poorly acted and just embarrassing to see. There were many Mary Sue characters during the film too, which overall had me very uninterested during the action scenes and even the climax of the film. I wasn't worried that Harley Quinn would lose or anything like that, cause during the entire film she's borderline invincible. The reason why I find batman such an interesting character to watch is cause at any moment he can lose and get seriously injured. In the batman universe he gets injured and loses several fights, so I'm always worried if he'll lose. I never once got that feeling during this film, I was more or less just watching flashy action scenes. I wanted to like this movie, I really wanted too, but everyone was so boring and uninteresting leaving me just sitting there wanting something to grasp onto for entertainment. Having an all female protagonist cast means absolutely nothing if they can't show emotions, have suspense or be interesting. This movie sucks.",3.0,16 February 2020

I feel like peeling my skin off of while watching this movie. It felt so over dramatic. I loved Harley's character in Suicide Squad but in this one, it really sucked.

The Bad Part: The dialogues sucked, character arches and writing could've been better, and should've been presented better. The accent of the police officer seemed very fake.

The Good Part: I love the music, the hyena, the character development of Harley in particular, on how she got over the Joker's toxicity to have her own personality. Black Canary's character should've highlighted more on her powers.

Tries too hard to be empowering,"A film that centers around Harley Quinn's break up with the joker but handles it in a way that comes off as it is bashing Suicide Squad. With a villain played by Ewan McGregor that could have gone down well but just like the joker in suicide squad didn't have enough screen time for you to care and just one or two moments in the film that tried to make him look like a big mafia boss but fell flat. The women empowerment in the film just seems like it's forced in to the film instead of coming off natural. Came out of the cinema feeling like there was nothing worth caring about, no real big talking points, couldn't seem to decide between cartoon violence or deadpool violence",3.0,8 February 2020

Poor story for amazing characters,"The movie has a simple plot, not that it needed a more complex one, but it has some loose ends and a termination that seems convenient for the plot yet unrealistic or goofy. The break of the 4th wall gives dynamism to the story, as well as the constant flashbacks which resembles the chaotic mind of its main character, Harley Quinn. However, they create an unnecessary disorder which may result in some confusion. Also, many flashbacks are use just to explain the background of the other women characters of the movie which is conveniently known by Harley Queen before even meeting them nor spending much time with them afterwards. There are many characters included in the story besides Harley Quinn: Huntress, Black Canary, Renée Montoya and Cassandra Cain. In the comics, which are the basis of this movie, they are huge characters with their own personality that is not well exploit in the movie. Here, they are presented as simple associates with few lines. I seemed to me that the team came together just because the producers wanted to have a women team rather than an actual need of the story. The performance of the actresses was not bad, moreover, Margot Robbie understands Harley Quinn very well and embodies this character; however, I think that the pseudo mentoring of Cassandra Cain would have given the movie enough for a story and could have left Renée Montoya and the other girls as little guests in the movie, a perfect seed for future DC movies which could have been useful for the franchise. The music and sound settled the mood, but the lines were a little bit loose. The final scene was forced to look as a huge women empowerment, which ultimate goal is awesome, but Wonder Woman has shown us the best way to do it: not yelling at everyone and having convenient plots for this, but letting the audience recognize it in the main character. Overall, is a fun movie with a lot of innovative elements a little bit forced women empowerment, but could have been much better (as I thought it would be from the trailer...the same happened to me with Suicide Squad).",6.0,28 May 2020

An Above Average Fun But Flawed Film,"After many months of anticipation Birds Of Prey is finally with us and I have seen it and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Harley Quinn break up with The Joker which alerts a criminal head honcho who aims to take advantage of her and a group of other women in Gotham City.

Main Character Even though this film is called Birds Of Prey it should really just be called a Harley Quinn film and Margot Robbie is fantastic in this film. It is clear that they are trying to make her the DC version of Deadpool and she is very charismatic in the role and has some really good lines in the film, I feel like she has a real good grip on this character and it feels like she really enjoys playing the role of Harley Quinn.

Supporting Characters Ewan McGregor plays Roman Sionis AKA The Black Mask in this film and it is clear that he is having a blast in this role, his character is very charismatic and a bit off the wall but that works because of the film that he is in and he is definitley an entertaining villain in this film. Now we get to the rest of the Birds Of Prey - Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya, Mary Elizabeth Winestead as The Huntress & Jurnee Smollet-Bell, they all do their best in their roles especially in the action scenes but they just aren't given enough to do in the film. I didn't really care about their characters and I think this was because there backstories are choppily presented and not given as much screen time as Harley Quinn is clearly presented as the most important character in the film.

Story This film has an interesting story when it comes to Harley's story, it deals with how she is dealing with her situation with The Joker and dealing with being a bit of a better person and I thought that was handled pretty well. But as mentioned before all the other characters stories and motivations aren't really explored enough to make you care and give them a real reason for being a part of this group.

Script This film has some funny lines and dialogue in the film especially when the film is doing its best to break the fourth wall and be a bit more interesting then many comic book films. Some of the drama is okay but it doesn't really hit the levels that I think it was going for and as mentioned previously it doesn't elevate any of the supporting characters above being okay characters.

Style This film has a really unique style. The action scenes are fantastic, really fun and unique. The film does a great job of showcasing the characters different fighting styles to create some meorable and really fun action sequences. However, the pacing of the film is a bit messy, the film jumps all over the place which I get was a stylistic choice but it becomes a bit jarring as you are interested to new characters often and the film isn't in order so it can make it a bit hard to follow.

Overall Overall this film reminds me quite a bit of Suicide Squad which is why it gets the same rating, an above average film that could have done with focusing up a bit more and showed the group together more and interacting. But this is a fun time at the movies and if you don't take this film too seriously then it can be an enjoyable watch for sure.

Rating - 6/10.",6.0,16 December 2021

I don't know about that one chief,"I like to watch movies in TV. Hard to explain why, but like this i watch movies in a different way. If you watch a movie in the cinema (or just stream it or download it) and it's bad i think in general people tend to be more disappointed. You payed for that movie, bought popcorn, travelled to the cinema, payed for the streaming, made plans with your friends or significant other to watch it, and it raises the exceptations. You want some level of entertainment for this. In TV it just you stumbled upon a movie and started to watch it. Like this i watch a lot of movies that otherwise would never start to watch, and at the end i found a lot of favourites. Now with Birds of Prey... I never saw any of te suicide squad movies (Not even sure if that reboot-notreboot is out already), so i wanted to switch channels, but my girlfriend said let's watch it. It was late night, so we were already in bed, meaning worst case scenario i'll fall asleap.

Aaaaand it somehow kept me awake until the end, true, but not sure how to feel about this movie. Harley Quinn is just irritating. I had a girlfriend with the exact personality, hell even a simmilar face, so maybe this is why the charater irritates me, but somehow it feels like even the writer had the same feeling.

In the other hand... Mary Elizabeth Winstead appearing halfway saved the movie for me. I think her character is actually what they wanted to achieve for Harley. The Huntress is also problematic, have stupid-funny dialogues, edgy, but gives enough reason to be liked. (Too bad she had not a single second of screentime with her husband)

Until that the only thing kept me watching were Ewan McGregor. But he is like woah. That guy have range. Since Mark Renton it's obvious he is a talented actor, but never saw him being evil. He nailed this role, overnailed it even. I think he put a lot of effort into this character, and it's visible. I think he had a fun time with it. I hope one day he can play a simmilar villain, but a better written one. Especially that he's ""exit"" is just stupid and missed. I was like ""Really? That's it? Where is the catharsis, where is the fight?"" That was the point the movie realle fell apart.

I read a lot of comments about this movie hating men, but not for a second watching the movie made me think about this, so i guess it's not for me to judge.

Overall this movie is bad, because at the end you have the feeling it was written to be completly excludable from the ""bigger picture"" if it flops. No character developement for Harley Quinn. That small she may had were quickly revoked at the end, and she kinda cut all ties from almost all the new characters, so if they ever put her into a new movie, they don't have to deal with threads from there.

I would never watch it again, knowing how disappointing the end is, but would watch a Birds of Prey without Harley Quinn anytime. Also a movie, where Ewan McGregor is at least an antihero. Please.",4.0,17 April 2023

"Get woke, go broke.","Get woke and go broke seems to be a catchphrase that has started trending on the right as of late. I consider myself a centered individual but, considering that most (not all) female only centered films tend to do portly at the box office gives credence to that new phrase. I love films, all types and genres and casts but, when you go out of you way to make men look ignorant and women the pillar of human civilization then reality slaps you in the face. If you want to make a film about strong women who kicks and take names then that is GREAT and I would love to watch it! Sadly, that has not happened yet (with the mild exception of WW). Do we need more diversity in Hollywood? Yes? Do we need more female leads? Yes? Do we have to cram down everyone's throat? No. That only pushes people away and doesn't accomplish anything but galvanize their point about ""get woke, go broke."" Go see the movie. It's worth a watch.",6.0,13 February 2020

Unpleasant and unbelievable girl power run amok...,"I wasn't a fan of DC until Gal Gadot brought ""Wonder Woman"" to life (and which I proceeded to see three times in the theatre), and didn't see ""Suicide Squad"" when it first came out. I watched it last weekend to prepare for this one, and it wasn't as bad as I had expected. Despite Margot Robbie continuing to be an incredibly compelling screen presence, that alone wasn't enough to save this from being a mildly stinky pile of poo.

I always hate being negative about a film written by a woman and directed by a woman and featuring five badass women in the climactic fight scene, since we're still sorely lacking in representation. But it's hard to be overly positive about a shabbily written and derivatively directed movie that made me feel kind of icky and that while offering slight entertainment, ended up curdling into unpleasant and unbelievable girl power run amok. The casting was great and diverse and Margot Robbie made a really unpleasant character somewhat less awful. It was also fun to see an older Rosie Perez still holding her own against the youngins, and I loved Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary. But unless you're a diehard DC fan, there isn't much reason to see this.",6.0,9 February 2020

an absolutely AMAZING movie,"If you still haven't seen this masterpiece of a movie, don't listen to the poor reviews. This movie is visually excellent, hilarious, entertainingly strung together, and has wonderful, but not in your face, examinations of gender and the treatment of women both in film and in life.

My only, minor, complaint about the movie is the way Cass was characterised. If you're a fan of comic book Cassandra Cain, then don't go in expecting much in that regard, they change her a lot. Still an excellent character, just one they should have made a new character rather than using Cass' name.",10.0,19 April 2021
Would watch again!,"First, the cast: Margot Robbie's performance as Harley was stunning and I thought even better than in Suicide Squad. Next to her stood Ewan McGregor as Black Mask who I thought was also a wonderful cast choice and did not disappoint with his interpretation. I walked in open-minded for the Birds and was pleasantly surprised by Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who I would love to see again, but on the other hand, not convinced of Jurnee Smollet's Black Canary (who btw happens to be one of my favourite DC heroines). I'm always open for multiple interpretations of already established comic book characters, but something in her depiction lacked that gave me NO Canary vibes at all. Else, Chris Messina as Victor Zsasz was trouble-free to watch so that I was definitely fine with it, but nothing outstanding. Ella Jay Basco's performance as Cassandra Cain was good acting-wise, but the writing of the character maybe not bad, but also very plain with space to work with. Would love to see her grown to the badass she's known for! And well, Renee Montoya, I hate to criticize, but she was the weakest of them all. The plot wouldn't be much different without her so that it's not just Rosie Perez ""fault"" but the writing.

All in all, the script was mediocre, but it was very fun to watch and visually great. The 'feminism' people seem to be put off by is subtly applied, thus not try-hard at all. It's just a movie with strong fighters as leads that happen to be females, nothing to complain! This comes from someone who's easily irked (not angered!) by 'in-your-face-feminism'.

If you're going to watch this, please do it without expectations, don't hope for an oscar-worthy movie, be open for it and you will certainly enjoy it just as I did :)!",7.0,6 February 2020

And some of the fight scenes in this were flat out beautiful! It is like gymnastics met UFC. The biggest flaw of this movie is how predictable it is. But..... I understand the choice to make it fun but play it safe after the catastrophe that was suicide squad. This movie is fun, well shot, and worth the time.

Made me angry,"This is my first review. Normally what other people think of a movie is irrelevant to me, and I expect more often than not the reverse is true. Movies are a subjective form of entertainment. Not this movie. It is bad. The plot is lazy. The fight choreography is amateurish. It seems like they shot the rehearsal footage and called it a day. The jokes were middle school level, but in an R-rated movie, and why R-rated? So they could curse. Unnecessary. I didn't expect much from this girl powe extravaganza, but wow was it bad. This is the first movie I can remember watching that made me angrier and angrier as I watched it. It's like Deadpool if your only experience with Deadpool was having it described to you by your 12 year old nephew, and with a girl as the lead. Nothing against women action heroes, but damn this was bad. Not one character that wasn't super annoying. How does a company make Suicide Squad, and then learn nothing and throw a 100+ million dollars at this. I could have watched a Nicolas Cage VOD movie and found more entertainment. By the way, normally I am sympathetic to filmmakers based on budget and resources, bu Warner Brothers has the money and ability to hire top notch talent and this is what they did instead.",1.0,15 May 2020

"Bacon, egg, a piece of aluminum foil and cheese of a movie","Let's start by saying I liked the whole thing except one cheesy scene with the Black Canary (you'll know it when you see it). It was worth it.

It's much better than Ocean's Eight at its social commentary, it's trying to be Deadpool when it comes to humor, it sometimes, momentarily, gets as dark as the Phoenix's Joker (movie). It has unhinged, quirky narration, explosions, mallets and baseball bats. No comment on bat men, but I think everyone's happy there's no Leto's Joker (character).

This is a surprisingly good mixture, a well layered atmosphere, like a good sandwich. It fits the character and really deserves an 8, 8.5 by itself. However, the story itself is... well, obvious from the title itself, the finale felt extremely tame, even awkward, compared to the thrilling earlier scenes, and the villain could be written much better towards the end, for example by attempting what his right-hand-man tried earlier, for another layer of atmosphere.

Like finding some foil in your otherwise great breakfast.",7.0,7 February 2020
Another poor DC film,"At some point Warner decided to change the name of the film from ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" to ""Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey"" in some places and this sadly tells you quite a lot about the flaws of this film. Is it a film about Harley Quinn? About the Birds of Prey? I don't know and neither do the guys and gals at Warner apparently. Most realistically it is not about either of those, but rather about milking the superhero moneymachine before people lose their willingness to spend big amounts of money to see these bad films 4 or 5 times a year.

One of the main problems of the movie are the characters. We have protagonists who are all the perfect fighters, while the antagonist and his henchmen are idiotic weak fools always waiting for their time to attack at the moment when the last 2 meter guy was knocked out with a single hit. In the countless fight scenes, there is barely a moment when we fear at all for our protagonists. Black Mask is the biggest joke as he is always portrayed as a laughable idiot. How are you supposed to fear this guy?

Because there are so many characters and the movie still spends endless time with filler material, we also never get a real character development with any of our protagonists. Quinn is getting over a break-up, Huntress is killing people, Montoya ultimately did what she wanted to do from the beginning and Cass is moved around. The only good character arc is the one of Black Canary who is in general the best thing about this movie. Huntress was especially useless, maybe cutting her out would have allowed the writers to focus more on the character development of the other protagonists or at least made the movie a bit less chaotic.

The second big issue is the script that seems to mostly focus on somehow jumping from one hectic action scene to another by whatever tool possible. It often doesn't make sense at all and repeatedly relies on Deus ex machinas. The film starts with a non-linear narrative and a lot of flash-backs which mostly seem to be there to make the dumb store appear more complex than it actually is. At some point the authors became either bored or overloaded and they switched to a linear narrative.

I also have no clue who the target audience of this movie was. It is R rated but to truly enjoy it you need the humor and intellect of a 13 year old. Everyone in this movie (maye once again except Black Canary) acts like the worst sort of teenager, overly emotional and vulgar and there is none of the darkness you might expect in an R-rated movie about murdering psychopaths. One can only hope that this movie being a financial flop stops more of these movies being produced.",3.0,19 April 2022
Watch the movie and make opinion for yourself,"I normally don't write reviews, but this movie go so much unnecessary hate for having strong female characters. I think this is the source of most of the hate this movie got because a lot of the negative reviews I have seen bout this movie are complaining about how the men didn't play a bigger role, or they claimed that it was a movie made to hate on men. Both of these claims do not apply to this movie because the men in the movie were not the main characters, so why would they need to play as big of a role as the women, and all because the men weren't front an center doesn't mean that this movie was meant to bash men. This is why I think everyone should watch the movie for themselves, and make their own opinions. Especially, since the negative reviews seem to have a lot of bias due to the mainly female cast. It is kind of like the people who left overly negative reviews wanted to hate the movie before they even watched, so they nitpicked every little thing.",10.0,10 April 2021

The DCEU fumbles yet again,"Birds of Prey is another unsavory and silly supervillain comedy. It's the worst of all the DCEU movies. It's a feminist suicide squad story that makes James Gunn's The Suicide Squad (another movie I hate) seem...slightly better. Of course all the male characters in this movie are creeps or idiots while all the women are portrayed as flawed but still awesome. Dozens of bad guys are nothing against 5 women that end up working together in the end. It's just really cheesy. If the people responsible for this movie think this is what doing right by women looks like, they need to be enlightened.

As a whole, Birds of Prey is uninspiring, amateurish, and all around poor in quality in about every facet. The story is uninteresting, the action is sloppy, the characters are awful, the acting is poor, and the humor is unfunny. Margot Robbie is a great Harley Quinn, but in her own movie, she gets tiresome. Her periodic narration feels derivative and unnecessary.

Only DC movie I liked enough to rewatch in recent memory,"I actually thought this was more of a 6.5/10, but gave it a 10 out of spite to all the 1s and 2s written by MRA incels.

-Like Harley Quinn/Margot Robbie, because she's fantastic here. If you saw Suicide Squad and said to yourself 'This would be so much better with just Harley,' you'll probably love this -Want some fun, stylish, neon-drenched hero(?) action. Yes, it's no Deadpool, but they can't all be -You like DC but find most of the offerings in the past decade or so too grim and dull

On the other hand, if any of these apply to you, just skip it and spare yourself the agitation and the world your pointless vitriol:

-If you have a slavish devotion to the comics and are going to fly into an impotent, frothing rage over the slightest deviation from them -If trying to be inclusive wreaks havoc on your straight white male sensitivities -If you call misandry and breaking men down ""feminism"" and apply that term to anything featuring females opposing males in whatever context

Losing the person you've built your whole life and identity around sucks...,"That's the point in life were we meet Harley Quinn at the start of ""Birds of Prey (and the fantabulous emancipation of a one Harley Quinn).""

Like the above suggests, just in case you're wondering what the heck the movie is about, it's about Harley trying to make a name for herself and find her identity as someone other than Joker's girlfriend after he dumped her :(

That leads her to do some crazy stuff that gets her involved in a crime story that involves a lot of really bad dudes and a few bad chicks, some of whom we'll eventually come to know as the BoP.

The story is pretty straight forward but it's told in a cool non-linear, and yes, Tarantino-esque way. The movie has a great energy and is fun throughout, with a few genuinely LOL moments sprinkled here and there. The performances by Margot Robbie and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, along with the young lady who played Cassandra Cain were the real standouts. I also loved the chemistry between Ewan McGregor's Black Mask and Victor Zsazz ... it was oddly romantic but at the same time not at all romantic. Really weird, lol. And don't get me wrong, they were both scary AF too.

The only things I'll caution against on the negative side are that it's more of a comedy-action chick flick than an out-and-out action movie. There's less big action and less gore than Deadpool, for reference, and it's also not as funny. Props to WB and DC for having the guts to make this movie, though. It's such an odd and original comic book movie in all the best ways. It's deff worth the watch, especially with your SO. And on that note...

Harley Quinn is far better in small doses,"I really disliked 'Suicide Squad' when it came out back in 2016. Almost everything about it was done poorly except for one thing: Harley Quinn. She was the one shining light in an otherwise very poor movie, and that is what gave me slight hope for 'Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn'. The problem I quickly found however while watching this movie was that Quinn is better in small doses. When she's constantly coming at you for the entire runtime of a movie she can become very annoying, very fast. Luckily, in the second half of the movie they obviously caught onto this and toned her down a bit. But during the first half of the movie she was almost unbearable.

One thing I give major props to this movie (and 'Suicide Squad') for is having an R rating. The levels of violence in this movie actually caught me a little off-guard. A villain who likes to skin people's faces, multiple very gruesome injury scenes (often involving people's legs) and frequent threats to cut a child open. They didn't hold anything back on that front and you have to at least give them credit for that. The only thing that could have made this completely unwatchable, with already annoying characters, was to have it be painfully bland as well.

I like that none of the characters in this movie have superpowers (barring the exception of one completely unnecessary and stupid scene late in the movie). That was one of the dumbest parts of 'Suicide Squad' and I was very thankful that it wasn't present here. Also it has to be said that even though she got far too much screen time here, Margot Robbie is very good at playing this character.

Considering this movie could have been a complete disaster, I guess we need to just take it as a positive that it wasn't. The movie looks good - in fact the set design of the big finale was quite brilliant. Also just like 'Suicide Squad' the soundtrack is excellent and blends perfectly into the film. The only things really holding it back are an over-abundance of annoying characters, an uninteresting story and some really bland action/fight sequences.

An absolute riot that bursts with energy and eccentricity throughout,"An absolute riot from start to finish, Birds Of Prey is by far the best film in DC's Extended Universe, thrilling with delirious eccentricity and fun-loving action throughout. Bolstered by a dynamite lead cast, striking and energetic direction and gorgeous visuals, it's an enormously entertaining blockbuster.

From its quirky, almost underdog-style action and humour to its immense energy, I was smiling and laughing all the way through Birds Of Prey. It's an enormous step in the right direction for DC, and feels light years away from the drab mess of Suicide Squad.

It pops off the screen with a kaleidoscopic colour palette, flies along at rapid pace over the course of a fairly short runtime, and packs a great comedic punch with its fourth wall breaks, charismatic performances and self-aware sense of humour.

The film definitely takes a lot of its cues from Deadpool, particuarly in its gleeful and still refreshing use of the freedom granted by its R rating. The action is spectacular and exciting, and with just enough violence to lend the movie genuine stakes - again a massive step up from the far more lifeless and sanitised Suicide Squad.

Birds Of Prey is an anarchic, no-holds-barred comic book blockbuster through and through, and it has a heap of fun in that knowledge. With the exception of the names on the poster and the DC logo, this is barely a superhero movie, but more of an unadulterated action-crime extravaganza with a handful of thoroughly entertaining characters.

The film's ensemble cast is absolutely brilliant from beginning to end. Although the screenplay gets a bit muddled as it attempts to establish five or six different main characters simultaneously, the performances are so dynamic and energetic that you're always eager to learn more about each character's story.

Margot Robbie is dynamite as Harley Quinn, and leads the film with immense charisma - even more so than her standout turn in Suicide Squad.

Alongside, Ella Jay Basco, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead (whose appearance is rather brief) and especially Rosie Perez and Ewan McGregor bring delirious energy to the table, making Birds Of Prey more than just the fantabulous emancipation of one Harley Quinn, but a well-rounded and dynamic ensemble throughout.

There's so much going on in this film that there's barely time to take a breath. While Suicide Squad attempted to use supposedly anarchic humour to mask an otherwise barebones plot, Birds Of Prey is filled to the brim with ideas, excitement and action, and director Cathy Yan brings it all together in spectacular fashion.

Although there are a couple of occasions where the film gets a little muddled between introductions of all its characters, Yan gives Birds Of Prey such energy and life that whatever you're watching is an absolute delight. It doesn't all gel perfectly well as a consistent narrative, but every little side story is filled with more fun and eccentricity than the last.

As a result, Birds Of Prey is an absolute blast no matter where you look. Its deliriously enjoyable visuals are backed up by an action-packed (albeit often muddled) plot, entertaining and likable characters, an eccentric and anarchic comedic vibe, big laughs throughout, a fantastic ensemble cast and directing that pulls it all together perfectly.",8.0,7 February 2020

Sway around with Harley and her wacky misadventures,"After my friend portrayed The Joker in a parody video I've been joking around that we had to go see what his ex was up to. Considering that the last time we saw Harley Quinn was in the 'fondly' remembered ""Suicide Squad"", neither one of us were that exited to see this. Which is why I'm happy to say that I feel fairly optimistic going out of this once. DC has been doing a lot better in the last year. After ""Justice League"" wasn't what is was supposed to be the creative team at Warner Brothers was re-arranged. Which turned out 'fantabulous'. Since then we've gotten a lot more creative movies where they let the filmmakers really thrive and do their own thing with stories with different personalities. For example, I never expected to really like ""Shazam!"". The reason? Well, it had heart.

It was good that the Birds of Prey are going up against a villain operating on a grounded level. To me It always felt weird that Harley was fighting the Enchantress' army with a baseball bat. Roman Sionis (Black Mask) is a crime lord and a psychopath. A perfect threat for Harley and her friends. You also get a good sense of why she's good at fighting. She's got a strong intuition of things and impressive acrobatic skills. All showcased gallantly with the focused fight scenes. That was an awesome surprise! The narrative is at its strongest when it's concentrated on Harley's mindset and perspective. There's an endearing side to her. She's not just completely a villain. There's a limit she won't cross. Her interactions with the kid Cassandra offers us an insight to her emotional side. Maybe there was an innocent youth that was robbed from her? Perhaps due to The Joker? There are times when you need a movie that's fun and plays around with structure or narrative. You can take it as jarring in a few places because the story can jump around. Didn't bother me since it goes well in hand with the unreliable narrator gimmick. The movie kept me locked in. Although some of the supporting characters didn't have enough gravitas for me to get latched on to their stories. Harley is the one who really steals the show. She's the character you'll see the world from the most and therefore care for the most. A solid ""Good Time"" flick. I was so happy to have been able to enjoy another DC movie with my friends.",7.0,7 February 2020
Utter garbage from all levels,"If you want to root for a psychopath, have your intelligence insulted and see men depicted only as incompetent or evil, then the movie is for you. How anyone can even cheer for this version of of the man-hating feminist Antifa-inspired Harley Quinn is beyond me.

For example - in the first 5 minutes the movie depicts her father as an evil man who dumps her repeatedly and then successfully at an orphanage led by nuns. Obviously anti-Christian Hollyweird has to depict the nuns as evil who spend their days thrashing Harley. She takes revenge by smashing a nun's teeth out with a baseball bat. Nice eh? It gets better. She gets herself a Hyena, but then feeds the Hyena the owner of the exotic pet shop because he dared being a creep to her - the movie shows his body being fed to the hyena - murder is all good if you are a creepy man I guess. Then in a club she breaks a man's legs because he dared to call her a dumb slut. She behaves badly towards both men and women - by the way - her friends are like a radical feminist man-hating Antifa battalion - gulag chapter 4. Oh - and they claim instantly that Harley was the brains behind Joker - patriarchy holding down women 24/7 - pure feminist psycho-dogma.

The movie goes on from there. These are just the terrible actions of this psychopath in the first few minutes. And that is what we should cheer for?

The original Harley Quinn whih was created for the Batman Animated TV series was funny, charming, crazy in love with the Joker, she also used her sexuality, but only had eyes for one man. She was no psychotic maniac. - even superheroes let her go at times, because her biggest crime was being in love for the Joker and helping him. This Harley is a first-rate psychopath that anyone should be advise to not be around.",1.0,11 February 2020
Tank Girl for new audiences...,"Yep, this movie really is that bad. It's Tank Girl for the modern era. They went for irreverent cheese and delivered the worst of both. The male bad guy is completely and intentionally one note and it's as annoying as it gets. Alienating the main portion of your fandom is as asinine as the plot itself. I also hated the entire supporting cast. It was complete nails on a chalkboard. One point for Margot and one point for the coke scene and nothing for anything else. Avoid this movie if you have active brain cells.",,7 February 2020
It's just okay...,"A lot of conversations have flown around the quality and the message of this film. And in all fairness this is an okay movie, it's not bad, it's not good, it's just okay.

In the great pantheon of Comic Book Movies I think this one shouldn't even be in the top twenty-five. It has nice set pieces, a few good action bits and a good soundtrack, I'll give it that.

Margot Robbie is amazing as Harley Quinn, and Rosie Perez delivers an amazing performance as Detective Renee Montoya, that's pretty much it, other than that is a pretty by-he-numbers film, a pop corn movie with very few laughs.

Jurnee Smollett-Bell is unrecognizable as Black Canary, she was pretty much thrown into the mix and the character could have been called any other name and it wouldn't have made a difference. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who is famous for starring in Final Destination and Scott Pilgrim vs. the world phones it in as Huntress, but the worst of the bunch is Ewan McGregor, he plays Black Mask in a way that's very reminiscent to Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor, in a very flamboyant and colorful way that makes him more of a spoiled brat than a feared villain.

The message was loud and clear, too. If you have heard people saying this movie does not have one good male character who's not a prick, an incompetent jerk, an imbecile or a would-be-rapist, believe them.

This movie would have worked a whole lot better if it was a Harley Quinn solo project, as the group dynamic feels incredibly forced.

Let's hope Harley finds the Gotham City Sirens, but then again, if it might end up like this movie, perhaps is better if she doesn't.",6.0,7 February 2020

DCEU Version Of Deadpool 2,"Watched Birds Of Prey to Open The New Decade And the 2020 Movie Season starring Oscar Nominee Margot Robbie(Once Upon A Time In Hollywood) as Dr.Harleen Quinzel/Harley Quinn , Jurnee Smollett-Bell(Friday Night Lights) as Dinah Lance/Black Canary, Mary Elizabeth Winstead(10 Cloverfield Lane) As Helena Bertinelli/Huntress Rosie Perez(The Road To El Dorado) as Renee Montoya,, Ellie Jay Basco as Cassie Cane, Ali Wong(Always Be My Maybe) as Ellen Yee, Chris Messina(Argo) as Victor Zsaz, Ewan McGregor(Star Wars,Doctor Sleep) as Roman Sionis/Black Mask who is the First Gay Villain in The DCEU.

I had fun with this Movie also Margot Robbie Cemented Herself as Harley Quinn like Ryan Reynolds did With Deadpool also Ewan Mcgregor seem to have fun playing Black Mask in only third villain role and Smollet-Bell did amazing as Black Canary better than her Arrowverse counterparts and Winstead did great in her brief scenes as Huntress I had dun with this movie while 2020 will have more stronger releases in the CBM world I had fun this was DCEU's version of Deadpool 2 which was its strength I enjoyed the Humor and its wackiness also had a great soundtrack and diversity.



Great Costume Design By Erin Benach(A Star Is Born)and Score By Daniel Pemerbton(The Dark Crystal; Age Of Resistance) , Cinematography by Matthew Libatique(Venom) and Amazing Direction by Cathy Yan(According To My Mother) DCEU Version Of Deadpool 2 7/10",7.0,9 February 2020
Birds of Prey is fast and frantic but never takes full-flight,"There's no denying its sense of energy and enthusiasm, something that was amiss in the previous Harley Quinn starring Suicide Squad but for all its colour, flair and style, Birds of Prey can't overcome a so-so plot (a major trouble for a lot of DC films), a sense of repetitiveness and a feeling that everything is a slightly too try-hard for this ""girls on a mission"" to ever get into full flight.

Undoubtedly a labour of love for its leading lady and producer Margot Robbie, who was the ringmaster behind this whole affair getting off the ground, Prey gives its leading lady a large portion of the spotlight and for anyone that thought Robbie stole the show in the mostly forgettable Suicide Squad, they're in for a real treat as Robbie chews scenery, feeds hyenas, cracks skulls (and multiple legs/ankles) and eats delicious looking egg and bacon sandwiches on her quest to recover from her breakup with Mr. J and fight for her survival after local crime boss Roman Sionis decides Quinn's time on this earth is up.

A lot of advance press and marketing has focussed around how Prey is all about the team up of Quinn and new additions to this side of the DC movie universe, Rosie Perez's novelty t-shirt wearing detective Renee Montoya, Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress, Jurnee Smollett-Bell Black Canary and Ella Jay Basco's Cassandra Cain but for anyone expecting a true ensemble flick, you'll be left disappointed as the films more three quarters Quinn show and one quarter squad-up as director Cathy Yan struggles to get her story moving before the half-way mark.

There's a lot going on in Prey, in many ways it feels conflicted as to what it wants to be.

Is it a dark comedy? A crime film? An expose on finding oneself in this mad crazy world? Whatever it's true intentions are it's hard for us to care or focus on any one particular thing as we fly between scenes, some with comical but also wince inducing violence, scenes with Ewan McGregor's big bad getting to swear and chew scenery but not do too much at all (bar one particularly awkward sequence involving a customer of his nightclub) or other supposedly feel good moments between Quinn and her teenage pickpocket off-sider Cassandra.

None of the stories components ever feel as though they combine into one cohesive and gripping whole and while they all share the same sense of bombastic and loud delivery that is at all times accompanied by either a terribly hand-picked soundtrack or Daniel Pemberton's incessantly over the top score, Prey never feels like a film that is heading towards any genuinely interesting destination or end goal as it seems content to allow its self-aware winking at camera or audience directed voice-overs to do the work for it.

It is a shame for not just the film but for the future of this type of solo/team-up Quinn adventure as Robbie remains the perfect fit for Harley's loopy delivery and some of the films action beats and stylistic capturing by D.O.P Matthew Libatique are fantastic but it all takes place around a rocky road of bad plots, half-cooked ideas and a feeling that for all its hype, this team up movie never even feels like we get the payoff of seeing a bunch of intriguing characters shining together in their quest to show the world these baddies can match it with the big boys.

Final Say -

Barely pausing for breath, Birds of Prey is a frenetic and colourful comic book adaptation but despite the best efforts of its leading lady, this newest addition to the DC universe is both forgettable and disappointing, failing to establish its posse of death bringers in a way that makes us want more.

Cringefest. Failure. Sad. Tiresome. Meh.,"This movie is great! And by that, I mean it's terrible. The great YMS once said: ""it's not as bad as Suicide Squad."" That may be true, but only by a razor-thin margin.

This movie tries way too hard to be cool in a very Deadpool-y way, but it's way more cringy than Deadpool. It's truly embarassing to think that this was made by adults, for adults.

Every single character is annoying. The plorlt is needlessly complicated and some plot points make about zero sense. Full of jokes, and 98% of them are absolutely unfunny. Annoying overuse of well-known songs. A few good action scenes.

Many people who are incapable of forming their own opinions, or of thinking deeply, will likely really like this. Sad, really.",,11 February 2020
A fun and enjoyable ride which surpassed my expectations.,"This movie was better than I expected. Cinematography was amazing,the Action sequences were over the top at times but still enjoyable, the music was cool and the best part was Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn,she nailed that role and it was really great to see that character in the big screen again. Evan McGregor was also amazing. The other characters were interesting and had an ample amount of screen time. The plot was just okish though and they haven't utilized their R rating much. It's still not the best of DCEU but, it was one hell of a ride although it was short scaled. Better than suicide squad.

I recommend this movie for all Harley Quinn fans and hardcore DC fans. Those who are looking for a Joker type movie,stay home.

Pleasantly surprised with this one!,"SYNOPSIS: Word is out that Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and The Joker broke up and that opens up a full-out manhunt for Quinn. She offers to retrieve a special diamond for Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor) in exchange for her safety as things get chaotic.

REVIEW: This movie impressed me a lot. Following a not-so-great, but slowly rejuvenating DC streak and a couple of unimpressive trailers, I went into this movie expecting to disappoint and quite the contrary. POSITIVES: I know it's no surprise, but Ewan McGregor and Margot Robbie were phenomenal. I mean Oscar like performances. I understand it's early and it's a comic book movie with comic book characters, but for me I was completely locked in with these characters and watching the movie I was just admiring the performances. Cathy Yan really directed this well. The shots were so beautiful and it felt like a real, dark world that I was immersed in. I knew it was going to have very cool color schemes from the trailer and it really enhanced some of the shots and helped build not just Gotham, but more so Harley's world. Very well done. NEGATIVES: Not all of the acting was on point and an entire police station sequence that was a really far stretch. I know it's a comic book movie, but the writing could've been slightly more clever there and the choreo really felt like choreo. Possibly due to time constraints, the fighting felt under-rehearsed. However, there were some very cool video-game-like combinations. CONCLUSION: This is a very fun movie that I think anyone would like. It is rated-R and unlike a lot of people, I do believe in most cases it adds something to be rated-R. It ends up being more realistic to me which helps me to fully lick myself in. I do wish it didn't feel like a ""How To flip a guy behind your back"" video, as much as a very polished choreo performance like the John Wick films. All-in-all a very fun movie that I can definitely see myself seeing again. Following Aquaman and Shazam, I think DC is taking steps in the right direction. 7.5/10.",7.0,8 February 2020
Worst writing I've seen in a loooooong time,"McGregor, Messina, Robbie and the music. The only reasons that this disasterous movie wasn't the worst superhero film I've seen in my life. The first hour of a film isn't that ridiculously bad, just like milions of meh action films, but the rest... Oh, boy. The only moment I laughed at this film was when I saw the absurdal fighting sequence at the circus. It was so bad that for a while I was thinking that it was meant to be like it. Then I saw the ending, and I was sure it wasn't. They just made a film with Harrley that wasn't funny even for a second. And to make it worse, they ended the film with the grown-up woman laughing at the poop jokes. And it was this movie, a really big poop. Don't waste your money, there is a lot of good films out there.

Ignore the HATERS!,"Okay, I apologize in advance if my review is a bit ""all over the place"", but bear with me and read to the end. So, as a die hard Harley Quinn fan (and one of her toughest critics) I admit I do not think Margot Robbie is the best casting choice for Harley even though I love her as an actress! That being said she did a MUCH better job on the character work in this film than Suicide Squad. Margot definitely had more freedom to be the fun and silly Harley we all know and love, without being objectified.

My biggest qualms with the film was that they seemed to haphazardly throw in HQ comic book references without any explanation, which I guess would make them easter eggs? Still, I would have loved to see Harley have a conversation with her taxidermy beaver ""Bernie"" like in the comics or even extend the roller derby scene since that's such a big part of her life in the books. Also, I'm always down for more blood. Admittedly Huntress' character seemed a bit awkward and flat, but still packed punches of her own.

Aside from all that, this movie was so fresh and entertaining! When I wasn't busy laughing off, I was completely captivated by the epic fighting sequences and in awe of the gorgeous imagery that felt like an acid trip or even like seeing the world through Harley's eyes! Not to mention the great soundtrack.

I'm still a bit confused how people are saying this movie is racially biased and pushing a feminist agenda because I didn't get that vibe at all. The ones spouting this nonsense must be extremely repelled by women and multiracial people.

This movie has its flaws, sure, but I paid money to be entertained and they did not disappoint! We all knew going into this movie that it wasn't going to be the work of art we know ""Joker"" to be, but a bright and fun exploration of Harley as a character, and anyone who knows Harley's character should have expected exactly what this film has produced. Ignore the bad reviews and go see this film. 10 stars for reminding me why I love movies and making me feel like a kid again!

Harley and the Birds of Prey.,It was definitely fun. More of a Harley solo movie. Had some corny cliche plot with one of Gotham's more menacing villains being really boring and annoying.

Only down side was no Joker but then the film would have ended up being more about him than Quinn. Ewan MaGregor played a decent baddie Black Mask.!

You're better off watching the new Harley Quinn cartoon series that has just aired with Kaley Cuoco voicing Harley Quinn.

Margot Robbie was excellent in Suicide Squad but for some reason she fell completely flat in her debut solo movie as Harley Quinn.

This movie was all over the place and I did not enjoy ANY of the characters. The cinematography was terrible, I was falling asleep during the action sequences, the dialogue was atrocious, NONE of it was good! Who wrote this? A third grader?

Nothing much to tell about. But the Harley Queen I mean Margot Robbie was fantabulous. She was damn good and perfect for this character. Robbie did not give in any part. Such as comedy in between action; or crying while laughing at the same time. This movie proves that the Harley Queen is one of the most powerful female characters in DC comics.

Black Canary, Huntress, Rene, and Casandra's acting skill was also good. But the problem Is with the Villain. His name was black mask, but he wasn't played the actual role of the black mask. Whether it is for scripting or acting? Who knows. The villain seems unsuitable.",6.0,9 September 2020

There's one scene in the movie I'd replace with something a little bit more real in a way the spectator could stay and believe more in the proposed story. As for the colors and lighting, I think that the concept and chosen tones and color palette really suits the movie and make it very bright, and lighten the dark part of the story. The special effects (vfx) are cool and I really like the part Quinn's enters a police station as seen in the trailer. There's a 2D animation recap in the first few minutes of the film that is really nice and well done in my opinion. Animation is a good way to start such movie.

It moves from one incoherent sequence to another, focusing on colourful characters, but fails to make any of those characters remotely compelling.

"A colorful, enjoyable romp","Birds of Prey is an colorful, enjoyable comic book book that takes you for a ride. Does not have anything new to offer and is kinda childish in parts, but on the whole keeps you entertained enough.

The movie on the whole has some laugh out loud moments, some gorgeous action set pieces. The movie is decent in the edit with how manages to juggle screen time between different characters without becoming jarring or losing focus on the plot. In this sense, it is what suicide squad wanted to achieve, only if it had a central vision.

Talking about the characters and the plot. The charaters are given some decent arc which just functional and not enough to make you feel for them. Some of the arcs are so stereotypical that the movie itslef acknowledges that to play it out for jokes. While starts of on an interesting note, where harley and joker are broken up so every single person in the city who was wronged by harley is coming for her life. But the end of first half, it just becomes about a mystical device that some char are trying to steal while others are trying to hide.

On the whole, this is Margot robbies movie. She brings so much to the table. Age is effortless and endearing in a way keeps the movie alfoat even in its lowest moments. Even though this movie was being promoted as a female-hero team up, I was glad they chose to focus most of the movie on Quinn instead. Narrating the story from her whacky perspective is what keeps the story fresh.

Not awful and not great,"There are two ways to look at the film - as a stand alone film or as a Harley Quinn film.

Getting the latter out of the way, it's not a Harley Quinn film, nor is the awful Suicide Squad. This is a character loosely based on one of the most liked characters in DC comics. But that's not an issue as I don't believe it's meant to be the same character.

As a stand alone film, it's ok. It's trying very hard to be Deadpool in many parts and falls flat at that. It's also not all that fun though it tries desperately hard to be ""fun"" with the colours and sounds and attempted jokes throughout which in a lot of scenes back fires. Ewan McGregor is also not all that great in the film, it's hard to understand his motive, he seems to have a different motive in every scene.

Warner Brothers has completely wasted their own properties with DC Films really, if they make a sequel to this how does it fit with Suicide Squad? Why would they make a sequel to either, the audiences didn't walk out screaming for more, nor or either memorable. Add this to the long list of poor, disconnected DC films, it's a mess. The saving grace is Wonder Woman which is amazing and deserves better from WB.",1.0,9 February 2020
Better than DC fanboys think,"I'll never understand how DCEU fanboys cream their pants over MoS and BvS and then turn around and pretend this isn't a good movie. I'm almost sure most of them just thrive on being a contrarian.

Anyway, Margot Robbie is great as Harley Quinn and the rest of the cast is great too with some amazing chemistry between all of them. The art direction and visual style give this film an unmistakable identity that wouldn't be rivaled until James Gunn's The Suicide Squad. Really the only valid criticism I can understand is the differences between comic Cassandra Cain and the films interpretation, but even then that doesn't make the rest of the film any less entertaining. And I think it's made up for with the 2nd best version of Harley Quinn outside of the comics, best is obviously the Batman Animated Series. Cathy Yan does a great job and I would love to see her at the helm of another DC movie, maybe a Gotham City Sirens movie with Gunn as producer. One can dream.",8.0,16 August 2021

The story actually was fun. Even the music was used really well to set the mood and upcoming badass scenes. Ok so maybe it wasn't as good as the latest Marvel movies (Except Captain Marvel), but it was way better then the last Superman and Justice League movies. I like it better than Shazam also. This thing does not deserve the 1 and 2 ratings all these other people are giving it. If you like this genre, then I don't see why you won't like this movie.",7.0,24 March 2020

Best DCEU film!,"'Birds of Prey' is the best DCEU film, next only to 'Wonder Woman' (2017). As far as entertainment value goes, 'Birds of Prey' is by far the best.

Right from the beginning credits to the end, it's a strong movie. Really solid screenplay, strong performances, good laughs. This film and 'Wonder Woman' aren't really comparable - 'Wonder Woman' is far more serious - but this film sports a much more creative and satisfying third act.

While 'Wonder Woman' follows the typical Zach Snyder CG-fight-in-the-dark-with-explosions, 'Birds of Prey' uses a much more interesting location, fun characters, and a final showdown that feels motivated and compelling.

As for complaints about the title - yes, this should've been titled 'Harley Quinn & The Birds of Prey', instead of the other way around. Make no mistake: this is the Harley Quinn movie. For fans of Harley Quinn comics, this is the most faithful adaptation you'll ever get. It's as though the film makers made it their mission to put the comics by Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner onscreen, and boy did they succeed. Any fan will get a kick out of it!",10.0,3 April 2020
"An ejoyable, allthough at times too messy B-flick","I expected Bird of Prey to be ""just"" a straightforward intentionally over-the-top action B-movie with an eccentric colorful cinematography and a kick-ass soundtrack. And the movie delivered precisely that. It's true that without Margot Robbie, the film would be only half as good, as the other characters are weak both in terms of acting and writing, except for McGregor, who does a great job as the over-the-top Roman Sionis.

Also, I don't get the whining of some people that the movie is ""too feminst"" etc. Yeah, Birds of Prey is an unhinged, slapstick film with a girl power element. But it definitely isn't mindless feminist agenda or anything like that. On the contrary, let's be happy that there're finally being made comic book movies where women aren't reduced to a role of pretty trophies for male heroes. Overall, Birds of Prey is a wild, funny if somewhat bland flick.",7.0,21 April 2023

Unpopular Opinion- It's better than Wonder Woman,"First of all, I don't understand why the people always compare movies with comic books?? I don't think any superhero movie has ever been made based on a comic book. You guys need to understand that these are movies based on comic characters and not the screen adaptation of the comics. Secondly, I know it's not a great movie but it's not that bad also. Its a good one time watch. Margot Robbie as expected has done a fantastic portrayal of Harley Quinn. Though at the end there was too much show of 'girl power', which has become quite repetitive and have become boring these days.",7.0,3 April 2020
Not your typical CGI laden superhero fare,"For sheer entertainment value, which it derives from the strength of its script and not from flashy CGI, there have been very films this year that have been better than this.

Robbie breathes life into Quinn. McGregor is even better. He steals the show as the bad guy, who likes to watch his henchmen carve out the faces of his rivals. His second recent effort, after _Doctor Sleep_ where I really loved his choice of movies. The other ladies and even McGregor's deputy have been given sufficient screen time to help you empathize with them or repelled by them.

The story at its core is like the early Guy Ritchie heist film, where people are searching for a diamond. The dialogue writer tries his best to do a Deadpool by mixing every second line with an expletive but ends up falling short.

It's not a typical superhero film and is certainly not meant for those who might go for it expecting tentpole budget chases and explosions. However, it is well crafted and is recommended.",6.0,10 March 2020
"Actually, not that bad",It was entertaining with lots of action and comedy. I laughed out loud a couple of times.

What were these haters expecting?,"Ok, so I don't get all these bad reviews about the film being men hating feminist garbage. 1. It's not that at all. 2. What do they want? Did they want the female leads to be weak and subservient? Did they want the bad guy to be good?

There are literally dozens of male led superhero movies. Off the top of my head, I can only think of three female ones. Including this one. So why are people acting like women are trying to take over Hollywood? For gods sake, they just want the same opportunities as men. I for one, don't see why that's a bad thing. If you're worried about someone taking your job, then you're obviously not very good at it. So stop whining, fix up and better yourself. It's just getting really pathetic now.

This movie is awesome in my opinion. I'm not saying you will definitely like it as much as I did because everyone has different tastes and this is simply my opinion. Not a fact, which is something the negative reviewers fail to see when writing their foul comments. They will tell you not to watch this film. Basically trying to control what you do. I won't tell you to watch it just because I like it. Watch it, don't watch it. Just leave any politics at the door and enjoy the movie for what it is. Fun, action packed and whacky. I didn't go into this movie as a feminist and I didn't come out as one. But I don't have a problem with women standing up to better their lives like some people do. If anyone is so easily influenced by movies and television, then they probably shouldn't be watching.",10.0,5 April 2020
Birds of Prey Still Needs To Stretch It's Wings,"Birds of Prey is a mediocre comic book movie, with entertaining action, but not enough substance and a poor screenplay. Margot Robbie is fantastic as Harley Quinn, but the birds of prey aren't interesting characters. This is because the movie puts too much focus on Harley and, as a result, doesn't have time to develop the rest of the main cast. The only backstory they get is narrated over by Harley, completely destroying the weight and power those scenes should have. Harley, herself, is very entertaining. However, I'm not a fan of the insistence to make her more independent by everyone currently writing her. This is because the tragedy of Harley Quinn's character is her inability to permanently move away from The Joker, despite how much he mistreats her. Therefore, removing that element of her character makes her far less interesting and compelling. I also don't like the fact that, in this movie, her characterisation clearly rips off Deadpool. However, Margot Robbie is still very fun to watch. Ewan McGregor absolutely steals the show as Roman Sionis. In every scene he's in, McGregor is clearly having the time of his life and he's so enjoyable to watch, creating the best villain in the DCEU so far. However, Victor Zsasz is completely wasted and nowhere near as intimidating or psychotic as his comic book countapart, instead he's rather bland and uninteresting. Birds of Prey is directed and edited very well, I can't say I was ever bored watching it. The action is also very exciting and fun to watch. In summary, Birds of Prey has enjoyable action, solid acting and is incredibly entertaining, but the script is quite bad and the characters aren't very interesting. I'd personally recommend skipping this movie.",6.0,20 February 2020

"Fantabulous Cinematic Experience, a fun & colorful ride alongside Harley Quinn !","I was not expecting it to be that entertaining and so nicely paced !... It flows really well from beginning to end. It has a great artistic touch to it, lots of stunts & choregraphies are pretty creative (several sequences are really striking), the settings as well as the lightings look very vibrant & colorful... The entire movie is magnificently shot & framed, the photography is eye-candy with some shots that look magnificent.

Yes, the story/plot isn't the most groundbreaking ever, but the way it's built is pretty cool... Plus it is served by dialogs that are highly tasty, with interactions & one-liners that are a true delight. The chemistry between all the actors is obvious and shows ; which of course is pleasurable and makes you want to follow this ""adventure"" and know what's coming next for these characters...

Talking about the characters, I think it's one of the strenghts of the movie. The writers, the director & the actors clearly enjoyed developing the characters, their traits/personalities, backgrounds, motivations, qualities & flaws. It grounds them in a nice way and makes you relate. Through Harley Quinn, Margot Robbie offers a fun performance that is worthy of Harlequin (with choregraphies & lines that are flamboyant), also adding numerous layers that make you picture the way her mind works and makes you appreciate each of her actions even more. And the whole experience of the movie definitely benefits from it. The other characters combine smoothly with one another, and each one has multiple moments when to shine. A mention to Ewan McGregor who (as always) has brought a great energy and presence to his character, making him pretty electrifying in every scene he's in.

One last mention for the brilliant costume design & makeup artistry, superb... The music/soundtrack is catchy and works well all along the movie. Margot Robbie/Harley Quinn's voiceover is a good idea and also works well with the movie and its specific atmosphere.

Overall a really fun & very colorful cinematic experience, with several striking scenes, cool sequences and characters whose adventures you want to follow...",8.0,4 April 2020
A Blast with Many Missed Opportunities,"To say films based on DC Comics have been all over the place over the last few years would be an understatement. Yes, they seem to have found their footing with films like Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Shazam!, and they even have a new series of Batman films on the way, but were these just a fluke? No, Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn (a title that I'll only write in full once during this review) absolutely continues their streak of quality content for this genre, even though there were quite a few missed opportunities. Here's why this film is a blast to watch, even with its faults.

Picking up after the events of Suicide Squad, but also kind of throwing away everything that happened in it, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) finds herself broken off from the Joker and on her own for the first time in a while. Becoming involved with a young girl who gets her hands on a diamond that evil villain Roman Sionis will do anything to retrieve, she finds herself a new friend. The first two acts of this film, however, are really just a set-up for a new crew for her to join. The third act of this movie is fantastic, which brings me to my biggest complaint.

This film is called Birds of Prey, but the actual team that the title is referring to doesn't form until the film's third act, which was a real bummer. The majority of this movie is all about Harley Quinn, which is fine because Margot Robbie is terrific as this character, but this movie felt like too much of a good thing at times. She was easily the best part about Suicide Squad, but I now believe she works best in an ensemble. Her performance here is great, but she needed more people to play off of. This is the reason the end of this film is so great, which also made the rest of the movie slightly hollow for me.

Switching back over to the positive side, which this movie has much more of than negatives, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis. This performance made the movie for me. Yes, Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are great supporting actresses and I really hope they further their stories in future films, but McGregor is probably the most memorable part to me. His hammy performance had me laughing on multiple occasions. If this was the second film in the Birds of Prey series and he was the only villain, playing off this group of women, it probably would've been one of the best comic book movies to date, but these elements weren't utilized together enough for me.

In the end, Birds of Prey is undeniably a lot of fun. Margot Robbie is wonderful once again, Smollet-Bell and Winstead steal the show in a few instances (which I wanted more of), and Cathy Yan does a terrific job helming as director. Being her first big film, I'm very impressed with her work here and I hope she gets to do a sequel to this because I will gladly spend another two hours with these characters. While not everything in this movie worked for me, quite a bit of it did, especially the third act, which has the perfect location to take place in. I really enjoyed watching Birds of Prey, even though I didn't think it was perfect.",7.0,7 February 2020

Suicide Blonde...,"After an animated backstory of Dr. Harleen Quinzel's journey to becoming Harley Quinn (narrated by the film's star, Margot Robbie, who provides voice-over throughout the film), she breaks up with the Joker as only Harley can: Ace Chemicals go BOOM. Not having thought this through, Harley finds she has no shortage of scumbags gunning for her who were only held at bay by her connection with Mr. J.

Meanwhile, there's a Gotham City crime lord called Roman Sionis/Black Mask (Ewan McGregor), who has a penchant for peeling faces off and is after a diamond that'll apparently help him seize control of the city. It eventually winds up in the hands (or rather stomach) of pickpocket, Cassandra Cain, who Harley finds herself wanting to help (for as long as it suits her, anyway).

Also in the mix are a singer from Roman's nightclub (Dinah Lance/Black Canary), a cop (Renee Montoya) and a vigilante known as the 'Crossbow Killer' (aka Huntress). The first two get a decent amount of screentime and interact with Harley quite a bit, but unfortunately Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Helena Bertinelli feels underused and only really gets any time to shine towards the end of the film.

The story is told in a non-linear fashion, which is something you'll either be fine with/able to follow or it will make you feel the film is 'all over the place'/'confusing'. It's actually not that hard if you pay attention. Could the story have been told in a 'simpler' fashion? Probably, but why should it? Other comic book films have played around with story structure, so why can't this one? And there's also nothing wrong with the film's soundtrack either.

Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley, like in Suicide Squad, continues to be the best part. She just brings so much energy and a real sense of 'fun' to the film, switching between a range of emotions, letting loose with her character's various quirks (her continued mission to enjoy an ever-elusive egg sandwich), taking delight in beating up bad guys (though resorting to non-lethal beanbag guns and glitter bombs when it comes to certain people) and adopting a pet hyena she calls Bruce (named after, according to Harley, ""that hunky Wayne guy"").

Regarding the film's humour, it's no worse than 'bro humour' you get in films all the time, the only difference is this time it's female characters who are cursing/dishing out violence aplenty and enjoying themselves as they do so. No doubt this film will be put under unfair scrutiny, receive harsh judgement and all sorts of nitpicking from certain types of people (mostly those who were never going to give it a chance to begin with), but it isn't a movie for them. It's for those looking to go on an enjoyable fun ride.",8.0,7 February 2020

PHENOMONAL GIRL... MOVIE !!!,,10.0,24 August 2020
Birds of Prey continues DCEU's streak of fun and entertaining (generic) flicks.,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

Since Wonder Woman that the DCEU has not missed a beat. Even though the latter is still my favorite of the universe, I have mostly a positive opinion about Justice League, Aquaman, and Shazam! Yes, these are not the greatest comic-book movies of all-time, but I would be lying if I denied that I was entertained. Birds of Prey follows the same path: it's fun, action-heavy, and it boasts a phenomenal cast. It has some issues regarding the actual plot and a few characters, but I'll get there.

First of all, let me get the mandatory compliments to Margot Robbie's performance out of the way. If there's a DC character better than Harley Quinn for Robbie to portray, please let me know, because I think she's absolutely perfect as a lunatic, over-the-top psychiatrist-turned-psychopath. Suicide Squad might be a total mess, but I doubt anyone denies how Robbie fits seamlessly into the Harley persona. From her looks to the way she speaks and from her physical movement to her facial expressions, there's just no better casting.

She embodies the whole film's chaotic vibe and even contributes to the (very) colorful set design. However, she's not the only one who delivers a spectacular performance. Jurnee Smollett-Bell offers a surprisingly captivating display as Dinah Lance / Black Canary. Even though Harley Quinn is the main character, I found myself caring a lot about Dinah. Her way of living suits the character's personality like a glove, and she's undoubtedly the best-written secondary character of the movie. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the others, and this is one of my biggest issues.

It's a film packed with cliches and attempts of making the characters aware of those cliches, which is also, well, something pretty overused. What's more generic? Having the bad guy telling the hero their masterplan or having the hero stating how the bad guy is incredibly dumb by thinking of doing that? At first, I laughed, and I thought it was funny the way Christina Hodson was avoiding to write straight-up cliche characters by making everyone else aware of the way these talk or move.

But the whole ""I know you're cliche, so you can get away with saying or doing cliche things"" only works for a couple of scenes, not an entire movie. This is why I wasn't able to connect with Renee Montoya or care about her narrative at all. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is one of my favorite actresses, but she has the least screentime of the entire cast. I never criticize a film for not giving an actor/actress I like a more important role (unlike other people, I believe it would be unfair to do so). Still, I do complain if I think a particular character should have been given more screentime, which is the case of Huntress.

I find her backstory way more exciting and emotionally investing than Rosie Perez's character, but sadly Huntress' personal story serves only as a not-that-surprising third act twist. There are several past-present transitions in the storytelling, most work, but some feel extremely abrupt. Nevertheless, Winstead is outstanding every single time she's on camera! Ewan Mcgregor offers a good performance as the villain, but he leads me to my other major issue: the central plot. Trivia time: a MacGuffin is an object, device, or event necessary to the narrative and the motivation of the characters, but insignificant, unimportant, or irrelevant in itself.

The thread that connects every single character is based on one of the most overused MacGuffins ever. Now, don't get me wrong: a MacGuffin is NOT a synonym of bad writing or of a bad plot! It's merely something that leads to nothing. Having in mind that Birds of Prey is a character-driven movie, a plot centered around a MacGuffin is not unusual. As long as every character works, the primary story can simply be a passenger (Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood applies this method). However, in Birds of Prey, not every character has an interesting story...

Basically, Christina Hodson's screenplay isn't exactly bad, but it isn't great too. Just like the film, it has its ups and downs, and I saved some of the ups for last because I do want to end this review on a positive note. Finally, a DCEU movie where the action isn't overwhelmed with CGI, but with detailed choreography and long takes instead! Thank you, Cathy Yan, for bringing some of the best action sequences in this universe. Even if the third act gets a little sloppy due to the amount of characters, it's still a very satisfying ending. The score beautifully accompanies the action, and the visuals are truly gorgeous to look at. The comedy bits are on-point, I laughed quite often, but my final remark goes to a topic I rarely address...

Birds of Prey is a filmmaking lesson on how to produce an incredibly diverse movie without it feeling forced or unnatural. Only AFTER leaving the theater, I acknowledged the fact that the cast and characters are from various races, cultures, and have different sexual preferences. Why? Because this film doesn't waste its runtime by having its characters mention how black, white, Latinas, Chinese, gay, or whatever they are. They simply are what they are, and we all have eyes to see them. Congrats to Yan, Hodson, and everyone else who decided to treat the characters as if they're humans like every one of us.

In the end, Birds of Prey (and the ridiculously long subtitle) continues DCEU's streak of (at least) good movies since Wonder Woman came out. With a phenomenal cast led by an outstanding Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Cathy Yan delivers some of the best action of the entire universe in a genuinely entertaining superhero flick. A colorful, chaotic, and fun vibe is present throughout the whole runtime, as well as a pretty neat score. However, Christina Hodson's screenplay lacks creativity. The main plot revolves around the most overused MacGuffin ever, and some characters are straight-up taken from the book of cliches. It's a generic comic-book film with a formulaic narrative, but one that possesses enough fun and entertainment to overlook the typical story.

Not the typical forced feminism movie!,"This is much better than the boring Suicide Squad. The characters and cinematography are colorful. Margot Robbie gave a phenomenal performance as Quinn, and the side characters played second fiddle. People are expecting a frame-to-frame comic adaption, which is not possible. We have seen it in Marvel comics also. The only issue was the unnecessary R rating. That is where the director messed it up. Could have gone with PG-13 and rake more money!

"Wanted this to work, but it's a mess","Robbie's Harley is perfect but she's stuck in the wrong story. Expecting her to tell a tale straightforward IS a lot to ask, but the constant back and forth wore me out.

Would've worked better if the BoP girls were already a team, hunting down a jilted, unhinged Harley. As it is, the whole movie feels like it was a bunch of post-it notes stapled together.

Margot Robbie is always the perfect Harley she truly brings the essence of Harley to life be it by the jokers side or on her own. The birds of prey characters had decent introductions and good screen time but like all movies the characters in ensemble cast get a little lost here and there but over all it was enjoyable watch

Birds of Prey Review,"This movie feels like Warner Bros' attempt to amend the mistakes they did with Suicide Squad. Hell, at some point it felt like the scenes came from a Suicide Squad movie. The question is, does it work? Yes and no.

What this movie has and Suicide Squad lacked is that all the casts are great. Margot Robbie is having the time of her life playing Harley Quinn, Rosie Perez was brilliant and funny, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is so good she should have way more screen time, Jurnee Smollet-Bell shuts her critics down with definitive performance of Black Canary (Oh and that scene was great and was so badass), and Ella Jay Basco was the heart of the movie. And don't forget the charismatic Ewan McGregor who is the embodiment of Roman Sionis (at least from what I have seen from the Arkham games and DCAU movies). The interactions between the main characters are the reason why this movie didn't suck. It was the only thing that worked but it worked so well.

Other than that, this movie felt like you're watching a Suicide Squad movie for the 2nd time apart from the fact BoP had a decent third act. I don't know why they inserted a song in every scene possible. Probably to make the scenes more badass but it definitely didn't. Why would you do that? It's like you're watching a never-ending musical video at times.

All in all, the movie was a good fun but it could and should have been better.",7.0,6 February 2020

That said, the movie was an action comedy, but most of it wasn't that funny. I laughed a few times and I did smile, but there no part of the movie that will stick with me next week.

Also, though the set pieces were visually pleasing, some of them didn't make diegetic sense. Furthermore, there was a LOT of slo mo.

What a good time,"It's ok, i love Harley PoV it's fun and she take a lot of inspiration from de comic books and i love it but it didn't feel like a Birds of Prey movie is more like Harley Quinn movie and i didn't like it when Harley narratens the other characters lives is really cringe and is too much exposition dialoge and it does't feel natural. My favourite secondary characters is Black Canary because is the only one whose life is not entirely narrate by Harley, it's more more subtle so you can understand her by actions, i didn't like what they done with Cassandra Cain i whis they had given her another name. in short, I wish this would have been a Harley Quinn movie and her emancipation focusing on it and we would watch the rest of the characters through the interaction with Harley and reserve the Birds of Prey team up for sequel delving into these characters (Black Canary, Huntress and Renee) because here they feel so secondary... the name of the movie is in the epilogue mentioned in the worst possible way, narrated quickly by Harley.",7.0,8 February 2020

"In my opinion, this film is great.","The story takes the time to develop each of its characters before putting them into a team, very much like the Avengers. Harley Quinn doesn't take up the whole film, time is actually used very well on each character. The exception to this is Huntress, who is seen only vaguely at the beginning of the film. I personally like how they characterized her, but that's just me. Black Mask is excellent, all the parts in the trailer of him being over the top are pretty much it, he is actually serious and intimidating but with a narcissistic edge, not at all like the joker or any other DCEU villain. The story is told from in fractured time from Harley's perspective wich is either a good or a bad thing depending on your opinion of her accent. The special effects are better than in past films and also very sparingly used. at the moment it is only minuets after seeing the movie i only have one real problem with the movie, wich isn't even really a problem with the film itself and is more of a personal grievance. Overall, fun enjoyable film.",9.0,7 February 2020
A popcorn movie,"This movie is entertaining of course and really changes how we see Harley Quinn, but the story is really old-fashioned. The acting wasn't that good and that leads at least to me that the charactars and their story lines were not interesting at all. And OMG the villian and his intentions are terrible.

This movie is much more grounded which allows for a totally different experience. The delivery is a little crazy but makes perfect since for a movie staring Harley Quinn.

Leave real-life at the door and just go with the flow !!,"This film just goes to show that Gotham City is one helluva' town. What a great start to a potential franchise !! Action-packed,full of crazy stunt work,as colourful as the comic book pages that these characters have sprung from - this is the crazy movie that should have been the flip side to Wonder Woman. Margot Robbie,the producer,shows she has the chops once more to put together a crowd-pleaser. Margot Robbie,the actress, shows yet another side to her talents - she's done serious, now she can do comic edginess. Could she ever play a comedy role? Her timing here and the way she breaks through the fourth wall implies that that step is not too far away. As for the director/writer team of Cathy Yan and Christina Hodgson,Yan shows that for a second film she is a capable director of action and Hodson shows that she is well-tuned into the fantastical DC universe - her work on ""Bumblebee"" showed she could bring to life cartoon characters into a modern setting. As for the cast, Robbie is good,Smollett surprisingly so, Winstead's part is a little underwritten for an actress of her pedigree,Cass is an interesting newcomer with an ability to hold her own amidst her elders,Perez can do little with a stereotype role of a capable female detective disdained by her male colleagues. It is the villains that are the let down here. If Messina's Victor Zsasz had been the main villain and McGregor's Sionis his sidekick, then the balance between the goodies and the baddies would have been a bit more horizontal. As it is, the audience doesn't get the truly psychotic showdown that the film is gasping for. Still, if there is a next film, then, maybe, Robbie, the producer,will address this and the film will get 9* from me. One last thing, I'm assuming that Weta Digital was responsible for creating the Hyena. If not,and he/she is for real, then Robbie needs to sign he/she up right now !!!",7.0,18 February 2020

Most annoying movie of the year,Unbelievably annoying. It astounds me how horrible the acting is. Possibly that could have something to do with the awful script.

crash and burn,"I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences. You started well in the beginning but when you lose my interest from the middle of movie then you seem not to care for the movie anymore that you want to see the ending right away. There is no Birds of prey, at least none recognizable from their source material counterparts. A dud from Warner Bros. Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work}, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best.The action was lacking and uninspired as well. It relied way too much on slow-mo fights or just too much going on to really understand it all. You know you have a poorly made fight sequence when they decide to use slow motion on every punch or hit to make it seem cooler than it is. They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU. The story is told out of order, which would work if it had an interesting one. The portrayal of the characters was somewhat adequate. The best thing about suicide squad was Robbie's performance but this vehicle is a disservice to the potential that was there. Robbie does her best but the direction, script and editing are not at the requisite level. An interesting character poorly treated by a very lacklustre script. Disappointing.When a cartoon does better than a multi-million dollar film, you've failed.",1.0,7 February 2020
"Better than Suicide Squad, but still underwhelming","I agree with other reviewers here that the title is severely misleading. This is a Harley Quinn movie, and the 'Birds of Prey' don't team up until the climax. I feel like the marketing team really missed the ball by not calling it Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey or something along those lines. The overly quirky subtitle 'Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn' is fine and all, but I don't think it worked to the benefit of the marketing at all.

My main issue with this film is the editing. Yes, it is much better in that department than Suicide Squad. They got good competent editors for the scenes, but my issue is more with the way the story was put together. Why on Earth did they not have the events in chronological order? They jumped all over the place, and it didn't add much to the story. I guess it's meant to show the frazzled mind of Harley Quinn, who acts as narrator for the film, but even then, the way it jumps from one day, two weeks ago, back to the original day, the next day, the original day from a different perspective, back to two weeks ago, and so on. It makes events harder to follow without adding much. The story would have been fine if it was told in chronological order.

The most egregious example of this editing choice is when the movie has a (admittedly pretty solid) fight scene with Harley Quinn, but then cuts to the day before to explain why she has to go do this fight scene, before cutting again to the fight scene when it was finished. WHYYYYY is that even necessary? Just tell the story in order! I don't get it!

Okay, but the positives. Harley Quinn is mostly good. Her hokey accent can be grating at times, but also it's part of the character so it works overall. Huntress was also cool. Liked her story, and the way she tried to be badass but kinda fails. It's cute. I wish there was more of her in the movie. In fact, all the lead characters were great. My main issue is that the film overprioritized Harley Quinn at the expense of pretty much everyone else, including the villain Black Mask, who definitely deserved some more screentime and development. The fight scenes were really well done, with some excellent, sparse use of slow motion. The choreography was fun, albeit unrealistic. And there is only one scene where there are superpowers used in the movie (I think the filmmakers forgot Black Canary had powers until the end) which made the film feel a little more grounded, less supehero, more martial arts heroes, if you get my meaning.

To be clear, though. While I didn't like the movie as much as I would have hoped, I am liking the direction the DCEU has been going since Aquaman. Shazam is great, Wonder Woman 1984 looks incredible, and while this film is definitely flawed, Birds of Prey shows a a bit more self awareness and style that was sorely needed from the Zach Snyder films and Suicide Squad. I definitely want to encourage more female led supehero movies, and more female directors making these movies. Some of them will be duds, and I won't pretend to like a movie for wokeness points if I dont, but the DCEU is definitely leading the charge in this department over the MCU, and I do genuinely apprecitate that.

It's an aright time waster, but I didn't care much for the characters.

Not as bad as you think,"So reading lots of the reviews, makes you wonder how many actually went to watch it, and not just the trailer.

So, that aside, yes it has issue, the pacing is off in places, which leads to an uncomfortable first third of the movie. That aside, that's where it picks up and becomes more stable in pace and action all the way to the third act crescendo.

The casting over all is pretty good, personally aside from Margot Robbie reprising Harley Quinn,, Jurnee Smollett-Bell was for me was brilliant, especially when I saw she had done her own vocals on the soundtrack.

The film was never set out to be a riotess comedy, it has laughs, it has great action and yes, the plot is not up there with Knives Out.

"Some things I like, but a lot I hated.","It's an entirely mixed bag...

I liked some things about this movie BUT I also HATED a lot. It's more a Harley Quinn film as opposed to truly being a Birds of Prey team film, but it's a serviceable film, kinda...

Firstly, the story-telling and editing is all over the place. Very very choppy and it tries hard to be in the style of Tarantino but it just doesn't work, because not everyone can edit and stylize a film like Tarantino himself.

That being said Margot Robbie is quite good as is her supporting team who are barely in the film. Like I said, this is more a Harley Quinn film, and the film does a good job developing her and showcasing her quirks, quips and unpredictable personality.

Shoutout to Mary Elizabeth Winstead who kills it as Huntress. I liked her the best out of the supporting cast. Jurnee Smollett-Bell is also pretty good in the role of Black Canary. It's unfortunate though her Canary Cry was only used once out of the whole film. It was such a cool moment, more of that would have provided kinetic flare that some of the scenes were severely lacking in.

I disliked Cassandra Cain however. I wasn't sold with Ella Jay Basco's performance. I found her to be a nuisance to be honest. Didn't like Rosie Perez's Detective Montoya either. They did take some liberties with her comic-book counterpart and I wasn't quite happy with what they did, and to be honest I didn't feel like Perez gave a good performance. There is a joke in the film that speaks true to how I feel about her acting, as Huntress or Canary states how she carries herself like a standard 80's cop in film/tv and it's quite true, she does act that way.

I don't think the film needed Cain in particular, and it could have therefore had more time to develop Huntress and Black Canary. Not sure what the creative team has in mind for Cain in the future but similar to how I felt about Montoya, I wasn't pleased here as I would have preferred a Cassandra Cain closer to her comic counterpart.

Wasn't too happy with what they did to Black Mask, a villain I'm quite fond of in the Batman comics but Ewan McGregor is clearly having fun in the role, along with Chris Messina who plays serial killer Victor Zsasz. They are charming yet extremely unnerving. At first it was disappointing to see Black Mask be extremely flamboyant, but strangely I found myself to be entertained by him. I must admit it kinda grew on me and every time I saw McGregor popup I instantly got pulled back into the film.

Action is over the top and violent, but it felt kinda empty and that probably has to due with the fact that it felt really really choreographed. I understand the stunt/action coordinator of JOHN WICK was involved, but I believe Keanu Reeves and the entire cast of JOHN WICK had months of training and preparing to the point where Reeves, Halle Berry, etc. can actually be stuntman/woman. To me at least, it looked pretty clear that the cast didn't have enough time to train. Despite that it was still fun seeing Harley break knees of henchmen with her bat, Canary kicking everyone she comes across, and Huntress killing fools with a crossbow.

To sum it up, I wouldn't rank this below SUICIDE SQUAD or JUSTICE LEAGUE, but SHAZAM, MAN OF STEEL, and WONDER WOMAN are still the three best DC films so far. I would also rank AQUAMAN above this as well.

Also just a fanboy nitpick, but I would have liked to see more connections to the larger DCEU, and I would have liked some connections to Batman, Joker and other stuff happening within the universe. At some point Walter Hamada the new president at WB (who is doing a good job), needs to address the absence of Jared Leto's Joker, Ben Affleck's Batman and Henry Cavill's Superman. Fingers crossed that they work things out with Cavill as Affleck is a lost cause, which is a shame cause with the exception of JUSTICE LEAGUE he is the best Batman on screen. Only time will tell I suppose.

2020 is the year of female superheroes and while I didn't exactly hate this movie, I didn't like it either. I'm pretty sure though WONDER WOMAN 1984 and BLACK WIDOW will not disappoint.

Okay,"Harley Quinn and Joker have awaits been a favorite of mine. When Suicide Squad came out I was ecstatic. I loved that Jared Leto's Joker was like previous jokers but, I loved that he actually care for Harley. He risked his life to save her. I loved the concept and everything. I know love can turn bad but, this movie seems a little strange. I liked it but, the Joker of this movies isn't Jared Leto. Which is sad how can the Joker who risked his life turn on Harley like this? I had always hoped they'd make a sequel to Suicide Squad but, I guess this is where the story is going. Over all the movie was funny and great. Margot once again did an excellent job playing Harley. Hope Margot's Harley and Jared's Joker are reunited soon!",1.0,16 February 2020

Has everything I wanted... Except a good plot,"Finally Warner/DC gave the opportunity to their directors be full creative, as they're not worried about the the R rating. That's good and seems to be one of the ingredients to create new awesome (and different) movies. Birds of Prey is really creative, the clothes, scenarios and cinematography are incredible; Margot Robbie gives her best as Harley Quinn; the action sequences are simple and very well choreographed (showing how sometimes a blockbuster doesn't need to have big explosions, cities in danger, or colossal spaceships to be awesome). It's everything good, except the script and the editing. The first is more of the same and give us a story that doesn't have anything new, neither has a plot twist, is really predictable and sometimes can be just a little boring. The second tries to be original, looking fresh and but unfortunately sometimes the way that Birds of Prey is edited doesn't fix well in the main story.

It's not bad, to be honest Warner Bros gave us a nice movie with some fresh concepts. However the plot isn't interesting at all and that's the biggest enemy of Birds of Prey. But, being optimistic, I think the DC Universe is going in a good way.

Harley's character develops.,"Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn): Another DC film, very much in the adult mode of Joker but not quite meeting those standards. Still a good, watchable film though. BoP opens with an animated backstory for Harley Quinn, detailing even how shre smashed nuns with a bat. Harley (Margot Robbie) brings us up to date on how life has been without the Joker, a split which leaves her with conflicted feelings. It has also complicated her life as now many crooks are out to take revenge on her as she is no longer under the Joker's protection. She realises that she must become a force in her own right and along the way she narrates a tale which cuts backwards and forwards in time, relating how Birds of Prey came together and the story of a diamond and a teenage pickpocket (Ella Jay Basco).

The origin story of Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is intriguing, from her childhood days to her emergence as an assassin who will shoot or stab you but prefers to use a crossbow. Black Canary (Jumee Smollett) finds her voice after saving Harley from being kidnapped and working as a driver for Black Mask (Ewan McGregor) a crazed villain even by DC standards, he likes to have his enemies kinned alive by his evil henchman Zsasz (Chris Messina). At this point I should insert a warning that there are some extremely disturbing scenes in this film, certainly not one for the squeamish.

Some great individual fight scenes and mass brawls along the way to a finale at an amusement park which looks positively post-apocalyptic. Harley develops as an character in this film (I loved her pet hyena, Bruce) which (imho)l has been under-rated by some film critics who have little understanding of comic book narratives or how they are translated on to the big screen. Directed by Cathy Yan with the screenplay by Christina Hodson. 7/10.",7.0,18 February 2020
Feminism Overload,"Margot Robbie is as always fabulous as Harley Quinn and there were some funny moments but that's where the compliments end. Every male figure in this movie has been highlighted in a bad way, even down to the poor egg sandwich maker who only ever purchases out of date cheese! Seems like the use of a movie to ostracise men. It would have been nice to have had at least one good male hero / icon in this movie to give the message that the whole population of men are not all terrible. In this day and age equality is paramount. I am a women and I did not once feel empowered by this movie - no high fives, no cheering were to be had. The 'fight' scenes are reminiscent of 1990s version Power Rangers, you could actually see where the actors were moving out of the way and not being hit. Even though this movie is clearly on a feminist tangent, it's quite strange that the female director contradicts this message by repeatedly explaining the back story of Harley Quinn, therefore patronising every women by automatically presuming that they would not know or have even read the comics! Watchable but entirely forgettable - next!",1.0,7 March 2020

Anyway, after hearing mixed things I had to see the movie for myself, and it really isn't that great. Robbie is having fun in the role, and there is some decent action, but the plot is nonexistant, and it feels like yet another comicbook movie thats only interested in setting up characters for the next one.

There are a bunch of cringey moments, and Ewan McGregor is almost as bad as Black mask, as Jared Leto was as the Joker, with his campy approach.

It simply felt like a fun action movie with a few kickass leads. I had a great time. I'm giving it a 7 because it's definitely only meant to be a fun comic book movie. There's not a lot of depth and a few plot holes that are expected going in. I felt it was worth the money and time. I'm not sure why people hated it so much. I'm convinced they went in the theater already in a bad mood about it. Harley is as quick, powerful, unstable, and cute as ever.",7.0,22 February 2020

"A Solid Harley Quinn Movie that DC's Fans Deserves, and R-rated superheroes movie is still Awesome.","I'm happy to report that Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of Harley Quinn is an effing Awesome DC movie ! It's more as the movie over than Suicide Squad (way better), and Margot Robbie was totally born to play Harley Quinn this makes her becoming a Powerhouse actress.

Without Robbie, Harley and the movie wouldn't work at all. Not just it's a solid Harley Quinn movie, this also blended into the origin story of Birds of Prey's women that so perfectly well done. All I can says is that I want 10 more of Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn movies and the BOP's women stand-alone movie for sure. The most genius point of the movie is this had Rashomon's storytelling style and the action-sequences are in the same style with John Wick and Atomic Blonde that will pleasing the audiences a lot ! This movie will gives a lot of opportunities to Cathy Yan to do a lot of great female-action movies in the future, and it's satisfying breakthrough for her as well. Great cast with Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rosie Perez, Jurnee Smollett-Bell are fantastic and Ewan McGregor's best role since Obiwan Kenobi. Great soundtrack too, and it's a much better female empowerment movie than 2019's Charlie's Angels that also a big middle finger to Elizabeth Banks too, basically, it's the best #MeToo movie we got so far.

The best film about women kicking men in years (JK),"This movie is 30% confusion and 70% women kicking evil men.

It's like a bad 90ties early attempt on a superhero film, but with well-shot (yet slowly becoming tedious) action plus some nice production quality.

It's also overwhelmingly violent and vulgar, and I'm not sure why.

Robbie's great in this and she's having fun, everyone else is just chewing the scenery. I mean, I'm not sure how I would've acted when asked to deliver lines this stupid. Ewan McGregor's talents are wasted in this one, but it looks like he didn't care in the first place.

The script is both needlessly convoluted and incredibly shallow. They also try artistic editing to give the film the Deadpool look but it didn't feel necessary at all.

The film lost me around the third act, while the action was good and was shot well, I just had no reason to care for the characters. Action is pointless when you're not invested in the story.

This film is great for women who just left their abusive relationship and want to see some men get beaten to relieve some stress (hammer to the groin included!)

Loved Robbie, the action and some good original tracks.

I didn't like anything else. Not a horrible film, but very flawed. I still appreciate the good things in this, even with all the man-hating stuff.

What was that ?,"This looked like it was going to be fun... it wasn't

Some of the gags and quips were fun but it got boring very quick and I am not sure if it was just me (although my wife agreed) but there seemed to be some kind of Anti-Men sentiment running through the movie. I know it was directed by a women (Cathy Yan) and I know the main Character is a women but I don't think it was needed for the story.

Not sure how well a movie with a strong a Anti-Female message would go down. But then again it would never be made and that says something. Its very offensive to men in general

But putting that aside I just could not get into this at all and it just felt stupid, immature and truthfully insulting to my intelligence and gender.

"Fun but not Fantabulous spin-off involving diamonds, hyenas, and an egg sandwich.","Margot Robbie shines as the maniacal DC villainess Harley Quinn in her spinoff.

Make no mistake, this is a Harley Quinn movie through and through. The characters associated with the title team are present but as supporting players. Margot Robbie remains pitch perfect casting for Harley Quinn. She's unhinged, manic, and as zany as expected. Her charisma carries the movie through the more conventional sections of the film. As a whole it feels very much like Deadpool if Deadpool was crossed over with Snatch. There is also a major story involving a runaway pickpocket whom Harley Quinn of all characters does form a heartwarming friendship with.

Rosie Perez is a solid fit for Batman comics mainstay Renée Montoya. She has a tough streetwise moxie that expresses itself through eighties cop movie cliches. Huntress is more of a figure than an actual character in the story but Mary Elizabeth Winstead conveys a presence that switches from steely to socially awkward that's amusing.And lord does she kill so many people in this. She's easily the coolest of the three Birds of Prey. Jurnee Smollet-Bell is only adequate for Black Canary, despite having a lot of screen-time. She's good looking while fighting in skintight pants at least.

Ewan McGregor is clearly having a blast as Black Mask, the Gotham gangster whose vile machinations unintentionally bring all the major characters together. He plays the camp and crazy scenes with relish, enjoying fine art and cutting people's faces off in equal measure.

The story is again mostly about Harley Quinn. Otherwise without going into huge detail it's about this missing diamond plot which admittedly is pretty basic. But Cathy Yan directs the action scenes surprisingly well for her first big budget movie. The final battle in an abandoned carnival is especially good. Much of the fights are stylized and over the top. The sets and costumes are pretty colorful and stand out from other recent comic book movies. The setup and characters are fun but the story could have pushed the envelope further into wackier territory. The violence is brutal when it is called for. Broken bones, gunshots to the head, and even someone's face being peeled off.

Did the world really require a Birds of Prey movie that's really about Harley Quinn? Perhaps not but it's an enjoyable girl-power action film for the Deadpool crowd",7.0,16 February 2020
Birds of Prey Attacks the Big Screen,"Welcome back to Stream to Big Screen! Now, it's time for the DC Universe to expand on the big screen. Meet the Birds of Prey as introduced by the fantabulous Harley Quinn. Yes, that irrepressible, wild card and former paramour of the Joker is emancipated from the Suicide Squad and shepherding us through the origin story of that lady gang, featuring Renee Montoya, Black Canary and The Huntress. Margot Robbie reprises effervescent and sly portrayal of Harley. Here, she dominates. I don't know what Birds of Prey would be without her.

Like most origin stories, Birds of Prey starts each character off in their own contained silo until they all come together in order to service the plot. As comic book movies go, this plot is not important. A bad guy wants a thing that will give him money to dominate the city. The ""good"" guys, or in this case the better girls, want to stop him because he's a jerk trying to harm an innocent kid. Yada yada yada! Crash, bang, boom! The movie ends. Let's be honest, you're not going to see this movie because you want to be surprised by what happens.

Cathy Yan's direction of the film can barely contain all of the energy Robbie brings to Harley Quinn, which makes the titular, Birds of Prey, take a bit of a backseat, and the screenplay by Christina Hodson is a little all over the place. I actually wish it had been funnier. There are funny quips here and there, but overall I wasn't LOLing as much as I had hoped. There's so much going on throughout the film. There are cartoon vignettes, explosions, and a lot of kicking butt. Also, Ewan McGregor, playing Roman Sionis, this movie's mustache-twisting villain, and Chris Messina, the sinister henchman, are so outsized in their performances that they make more of an impact that the Birds of Prey as well - although McGregor, in particular, should have been reined in a bit. In fact, I wish there had been more to The Huntress. She just recedes in the background while both Renee Montoya, played by Rosie Perez, and Black Canary, played by Jurnee Smollett-Bell, get good moments and hold their own against the otherwise dominating Harley Quinn.

Nevertheless, there is a lot to like aside from just Margot Robbie. The film's runtime is manageable and not bloated like some other comic book movies - I'm looking at you, Marvel Universe. In general, the movie moves at a good clip, not really wasting time. The fight scenes have a lot of pizzazz to them, which is interesting considering how dark films set in Gotham can be. Also, there are some really good and interesting music choices sprinkled throughout.

Birds of Prey is worth the price of a ticket in the theater. It was a fun night at the cinema. Sure, the plot isn't important but you're really just there to see Harley Quinn wreak havoc. And, havoc she wreaks!

I think we completely agree on this one. DC Comics has provided one of their more entertaining films with Birds of Prey. When the dust clears, DC has provided the theaters their female Deadpool-like protagonist. I do wish the movie were a bit funnier and the villain a bit more essential to the story but I'll suffice with great fight scenes instead. This movie definitely is a good watch on the big screen but save yourself a few bucks with a matinee showing.",7.0,8 February 2020

Takes flight and stays on course,"The Joker(Leto, not Phoenix) kicks out Harley(Robbie, showing more sides and dimension), in just the most recent of many cases of her trying to please guys who clearly aren't good for her. As such she no longer has his protection, and as it turns out a lot of people have grievances with her. They are frequently introduced in freeze-frame gags that are one of the numerous ways in which this is Suicide Squad if that movie was actually great, and not a mess, editing and tone wise. Other examples include the extensive use of music, which here is allowed to land and be effective, instead of almost immediately ending. As well as the story structure not being quite chronological in showing the events, now properly setting up who the different people are, and giving them depth. Black Canary(Smollett-Bell, an incredible performer, you seriously have to hear her cover of ""This Is A Man's World"" for yourself) sings in the club of Roman Sionis(McGregor, deliciously unpredictable as a cruel narcissist), but if pressed, she might be willing to admit that he does awful things. Renee Montoya(Perez) is an excellent cop who struggles to because of rotten coworkers. She believes that Huntress(Elizabeth Winstead, cool while also a hilarious Batman parody) is working for him, just like Victor Zsasz(Messina, sadistic, understands his master and knows how to deal with his outbursts) his right-hand man. Teenager Cassandra Cain just robbed him, not realising it would put a bullseye on her back. So the four women(who feel like they're each in their own film... and it's so good. Just. The very best) have to try to protect her, as every criminal in Gotham City tries to score by catching her.

This movie deeply resonates with a lot of people. The feeling of being rejected and not giving up. Of standing up for what's right, even if you feel like you don't have a personal stake in the matter. It is easy to relate to the young pickpocket, and want to see her safe. Second unit director Chad Stahelski, known for helming the three John Wick chapters, lends the action scenes the same fluidity here, again highlighting the significant fighting prowess of the combatants, and, here, also the teamwork on display. Despite similarities, this doesn't feel like it's just Deadpool starring Quinn. It has its own distinct identity. In some ways it's equal or superior to those two pictures. This choice makes a ton of sense for this.

There is a lot(not an excessive amount) of gore, violence and strong language in this. I wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone that the promotional material appeals to. 8/10",8.0,7 February 2020
"While the Joker is schmoozing people at the Oscars, Harley and the girls are off to the MTV VMAs.","Birds of Prey (And The Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) brings back the villain we all love to hate, and love (not you Joker), Harley Quinn. After single-handedly carrying The Suicide Squad in 2016 (which saw a major demand for Harley Quinn costume during that year's Halloween) Margot Robbie took matters into her own hands and kept on working to get this movie off the paper and onto our screens. We follow Harley on her quest to move on from the Joker and finds herself in the company of four other badass women who are doing it for themselves in the poorest side of Gotham, where Bruce Wayne's parents were murdered and where the Joker is less likely to be seen. We are introduced to the villain Black Mask played by the ever-reliable Ewan McGregor (Sam Rockwell passed on the role), who's the bisexual spoiled brat version of Bruce Wayne looking to take control as the newest bad boy in town.

Initially, the movie seemed doomed both due to internal and external forces seemingly working against its favor. While BOP has been tracking favorably before it's release, external forces such as the recent virus outbreak may be keeping people away from the cinema especially in Asia (there were less than 20 people where I watched but to be clear this was on a Saturday afternoon after Valentine's Day.) Of course, I'll only need to mention that so far, female themed movies with too many clothes on haven't been as successful as their less-clothed counterparts (Charlie's Angels 2019 & Ocean's 8 vs. Charlie's Angels 2000 & 20003.) As for the internal factors, these include confusion whether this is a group movie or a standalone for Harley with guests. It would make sense that it's a standalone movie seeing how larger than life Margot Robbie's portrayal of the quintessential sidekick has been but she was adamant about making it an R18 girl group film, so as not to be confused as a chick flick. From a viewer's point of view though it got confusing and it was an error to at the very least not make her the selling point of the film (there's a WB directive to rename the movie Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey at least via search engines.) Also lacking is showing how complex Harley is that you can not just box her as a heroine or a villain even in her own movie. The movie could've been way crazier (deserving of its R18 rating) but they failed to capitalize on this and made her look like another character in the long line of superhero movies waiting to be made.

Final verdict? It's a good enough movie, worthy of being the 8th in the DCEU and enough to pass on the mantle from Shazam! to Wonder Woman 1984 four months from now. There are not enough words to praise Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, the comedy is dark but spot-on, the action scenes are fresh and impressive, the supporting characters played their part with Fil-Am Ella Jay Basco and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as standouts, the screenplay and directing needs a little more polishing but all in all, it's a fun movie and we should see more of the fantabulous emancipated Harley Quinn soon.",7.0,22 March 2020
Another movie hijacked,"We get it, it's a girls movie and they're the boss here. But like every single man in this movie is a bad guy? And not even kidding, a super bad guy who wants to harm/belittle women. Nobody is even neutral, so to speak. Come on now, how 'bout being a little realistic?

With this, we come to how unrealistic this movie actually is. It's so colourful that it's distracting. The first 20 or so minutes are as dull as dust. Editing is a mess and on top of it you have a narration by Miss Quinn herself, who likes to start off with bits and pieces of her story from wherever the heck she wants and whenever, while she's at that.

Since Deadpool came out, there has been an increasing trend of adding cheeky humour while you kill a bunch of bad guys. It doesn't work all the time, not in this movie at least. The whole thing is pretentious, dialogues are just meh. What is good here, I cannot seem to see. It was a chore sitting through the whole thing.

Conclusion: Below Average. You're not missing out on anything",4.0,30 July 2020
Harley Quinn by Miss Margot Robbie,,6.0,23 October 2020
Fantabulous Indeed!,"I did not expect this movie to fit my personal taste, but it hit just the right amount for me.

Soundtrack was awesome, especially paired with the badass and creative fight scenes. The fighting isnt realistic so if you prefer making sense, this isn't for you. They're really creative though, with fantastic settings and some good comedic beats. (Though not all hit but find me a movie that does)

The characters were great, Ewan McGregor is awesome but you already know that. Harley Quinn was a very interesting character to me and a lot of fun, once you put her in a world of her own. Please do this again DC. Black Canary was awesome. Huntress was good. The one character I did not like at all for some reason was officer Montoya. Might just be me, but I found her character awkward and almost mood-killing. They all need more depth, especially Huntress, Cassandra, and Black Mask. But DC is providing better characters in my opinion and I like where they're heading.

I also though there were times where the pacing felt like a hectic game of red-light green-light, however I didn't feel it hampered the experience too much.

All in all. Worth giving it a shot. Like most movies it might not be for everyone, but I think if you're curious about seeing it. You might as well, I think you could be pleasantly surprised.

Gen Z Pretend Feminism,"Bad direction, writing, fight choreography, soundtrack all add up to a film committing suicide in front your eyes.

The great cast do what they can with an awful train crash of a film. Any film that makes me wonder if I'd rather sit through last jedi or this again is in a seriously bad company. It may even be worse than the original Suicide Squad film. Or even Predator 2... The direction/editing is exceptional cutting every 2 seconds. The fight choreography is either really contrived plot armored or... Done by someone who has no idea about fights. Again let's cut every 1 second to avoid any.

My partner said I'd rather you fart in my face for the same duration than sit through that again.

There is a brilliant scene half way through, largely thanks to Mcgregor and whomever the actor who played Erika (even the bit parts are great). But it's then thrown away by a lack of understanding of pace and holding a shot by either director or editor... One of them really needs a few more lessons.

The main culprit tho, as in all these recent films, is the appalling Dr Who level writing. It's bad. Like sub comic book bad. Yes, the whole concept of Harly is dumb, and the whole DC is all a bit inconsistent and dumb... But...",3.0,16 July 2022

Why the bad reviews? Here is why I liked it:,"The female led production is packed with fun, an entertaining storytelling, a great score consisting mostly of uptempo songs, adorable characters and most of all: Margot Robbie. She lives this role like no other. Margot made Harley come to life with a sweet voice, hilarious grimaces and just the right amount of drama. The cast features lovely performances of Jurnee Smollett as a versatile artist and newcomer Ella Jay Basco as the notorious Cassandra Cain.

Now I didn't read the comics and watched this film for entertainment purposes. I think the producers did a lot right concerning the action choreography, which was always intense and the camera work. There are many cuts but they are done smooth and less confusing than similar productions. The story is refreshing and mad, just a good contrast to the ever boring Marvel superhero movies.

The settings are superb, like the funpark or Roman Sionis' different rooms in his mansion. The decoration is done with love and care about details. Many ideas like the rollerblades scenes or the female gang fights are executed in stunning ways. The characters have their unique ways of body language and thus appear interesting. Watch it for yourself and enjoy with friends on a Saturday night!",10.0,9 August 2021
I don't understand the 1 reviews,"Not sure why somepeople watch movies. Surely the point is to be entertained, which makes the raft of 1 star reviews ridiculous.

Absolute garbage,"The fact that this movie is rated higher than The Suicide Squad is testimonial to the horrific female empowerment bias by the critics. Margot Robbie was brilliant in her portrayal of Harley Quinn in The Suicide Squad but this movie didn't do the character any favors. It especially took a very amazing badass character like Cassandra Caine and made her into a bumbling joke.

Harley Quinn,"The movie itself wasn't that spectacular and the plot quite bland but that's OK, we have Harley Quinn.

I just watched Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey back to back.

While the former was a so-so action flick with almost no character development and forgettable production values (also not as bad as many people seem to think), the latter is a unique and fun piece of entertainment that relies on timing, comedic value and a good plot.

Its cinematography and editing are much better than that of Suicide Squad.

I feared the worst but it was OK,"Watched out of boredom and lack of options due to COVID-19, from the trailer and early reviews I expected to really dislike this film (we watched it because my partner wanted to).

It was actually quite close to being a decent film. Without going into spoilers, some of the isses that went against it:

1) Varying level of quality when it came to the action sequences. Some of the stunt and fight choreography was actually surprisingly good, and certainly I was surprised by Margaret Robbie's capabilities. However, for every ""wow"" moment there is multiple poor ones, with stunt men passively waiting on being attacked or being knocked out and defeating by moves that clearly were not hurtful (being thrown to the floor seemed to be a fatal blow in this film). The fact that some of the fight sequences were actually very good means this came down to just laziness on the director's part in terms of pushing his crew to get it right.

2) A lot of the script didn't work outside of Harlequinn. In particular, Huntress was awkward and her dialog hard to sit through.

3) There were just some rather dense moments that were puzzling. At one point whilst confronted by an overwhelming force, the female team take a break from fighting to just casually walk out of a building and get shot at. Or another moment when Harlequinn is ambushed at home, and then the people attacking her just seem to disappear for the convenience of the rather thin plot.

It is a fun, wild ride with some laughs and some surprisingly good action. It just came dangerously close to being a good film with a bit more love and attention to detail.",6.0,26 March 2020

The soundtrack features a lot of pop/classic rock songs, and they're incorporated a lot more subtly than most movies in recent years.

I was a little concerned that the character of Harley Quinn would get on my nerves, but while she is fairly obnoxious, she never becomes annoying or unsympathetic. Margot Robbie's performance (along with Cathy Yan's directing and Christina Hodson's writing) really sell the character. I'd happily watch a dozen movies with her in this role.

The rest of the cast including the actual ""Birds of Prey"" and and Ella Jay Basco's Cassandra Cain are great and become ever better when the team is finally formed and everyone is interacting with each other.

One aspect of the movie that stands out is how well it portrays Harley Quinn's point of view. The audience is taken on a wild ride through her perspective, and it's a thrilling experience. The all-female team-up at the end of the movie was actually quite good and actually has a legitimate reason behind it, unlike some other movies that have shoehorned in similar scenes without much justification.",7.0,29 April 2023

The Margot Robbie show,"Birds of pray offers a very different type of comic book film and I would say it is more female driven, very much aimed at female empowerment! It has good and not so great elements as a whole. Lets start with the positives, one being of course once again Margot Robbie. Robbie displays a psychopathic nutjob once more. A film that could be described as the Margot Robbie show. This time I'd say even more caricatured and wacky and much more comfortable in the role. Not that she was useless in suicide squad, but she definitely embraces and explores the character with what appears much more freedom in this one. Another warming performance was Ewan McGregor as the black mask. He pulled off an insane mob boss nicely and although he seemed to want control of everything he seemed to have trouble keeping himself in check at times. Director Cathy Yan shows some nice contrast not only with the visuals in this movie but also the wacky chaotic music. This pallet is very artistic in some shots and suited to comic style. I particularly like the scene in the amusement park with lots of shades of blue and the scene of the destruction of Ace chemicals. Occasionally I felt like I was going to be watching a comedy superhero movie like the mask in the early stages of the film. On a negative side the story is weak and sometimes various parts don't feel like they are part of the same movie. It's kinda dark in places but then comedic in others. The entire police force seem undermined and used inefficiently. Renee Montoya played by Rosie Perez is the main detective on the case but appears to assist our anti heroes by the end. Black Canary and Huntress are there but again this really is the Harley Quinn/Margot Robbie show. Just like in the 90s when you'd watch a Jim Carrey film with little plot and happily go to see Jim. By no means is this film terrible but neither is it great. If you like watching Margot do her thing as Harley then it is passable.",6.0,15 February 2020

Fantabulous Fun,"Birds Of Prey in its 105min runtime gives us a truly enjoyable time.

The acting performances of Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor were excellent. And the soundtrack was surprisingly awesome to the point where I can honestly say I could listen to most of these songs in my own free time. However the main complaint I would say is that the plot is somewhat basic, taking a deadpool-esque story which while okay didnt really do much except for the ending which was quite unexpected (in a good way). Also a little sidenote for anyone who reads comic books, the film aside from Harley Quinn isnt that faithful to its source material so if you do care about that, just be warned that you will be watching a different take on these characters. In the end, if you're looking to have a fun time (which this film definitely gives!) and you dont take the film too seriously, then you should definitely watch this.",7.0,27 February 2020

Birds of Prey is more Harley Quinn then a team. It's design and action still makes it entertaining,"When you consider movies like The Avengers, Justice League, and Guardians of the Galaxy, it shows that audiences love their group hero movies. They love watching their favorite characters interacting and trying to work with each other to take down whatever their facing. It's something that we've seen in comics for a while, but only now is it being embraced. Some of it was copyrights, but the real reason is because these movie are more popular now then ever. It doesn't even have to be superheroes; villains can have as much popularity. Especially when you consider how much controversy Joker got, but it still was a hit with audiences and critics.

Another villain who's had a lot of success is Harley Quinn. She's a fairly recent character, who made her first appearance in Batman: The Animated Series and not the comics first. But she's been so well liked that she's become a vital part of the DC comics. She also happened to be a highlight of 2016's Suicide Squad. While the reception was mixed (and I agree), most people agreed that Margot Robbie captured the psychotic nature of the clown woman whose love-struck with the Joker (and we're talking about Jarred Leto's Joker). Let's see if she can carry things on her own with Birds of Prey.

Sometime after Suicide Squad, the Joker has officially dumped Harley Quinn (played by Margot Robbie) and cast her out. She makes it official for Gotham (and it's underbelly crime families) by blowing up Ace Chemicals. Without her ""Puddin"", she tries to move forward including taking up roller derby and spending her nights partying at clubs. But she also finds herself a constant target of people she wronged. Some are simple injuries, and others are crime lords who take advantage of that Joker is no longer protecting her.

At the same time, a young girl Cassandra (played by Ella Jay Basco) ends up pickpocketing a diamond that has a large bank account number imprinted. She too becomes a target from a lot of people, not no one more then local crime lord Roman Sionis/Black Mas (played by Ewan McGregor). He succeeds in capturing Harley Quinn, but she makes a deal for him to spar her if she can find Cassandra. When she does locate Cassandra, she has already swallowed the diamond. Harley not only takes the position to protect her, but she also gets help from other women, Huntress (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Black Canary (played by Jurnee Smollett-Bell), and detective. Renee Montoya (played by Rosie Perez).

For a movie called Birds of Prey, it sure does focus a lot on Harley Quinn. To be fair, Margot Robbie is still pulling in all the right punches to play this character. The movie does go into her background as a former psychologist and uses it to her advantage when dealing with Cassandra or Black Mask. That might explain why most of the marketing has been on her and not on the other women.

Because of this, the movie takes a while to get going as some of the other Birds of Prey don't come in for at least twenty-five minutes. They don't even get together as a team until towards the final act. But because the movie puts most of the focus on Harley Quinn, you don't much of a chance to know a lot of the other heroes. I would have loved to know more about Huntress or Black Canary. They're played by phenomenal actresses and could have potential. One of the bigger highlights is Ewan McGregor who is having a blast as this gangster who seems more like an evil fashion critic.

I have to give Birds of Prey credit for at least having a nice looking production. Director Cathy Yan knows how to set up a world that's just as colorful as Harley Quinn's attitude. The sets from Black Mask's lair to the funhouse where a major fight happens, does leave a bigger impression then I expected. I'd say the film is still entertaining if your willing to except it's more of a Harley Quinn movie then a Birds of Prey movie. I think most audiences will be more forgiving of that then anything.

I'll give this six Harley Quinns out of ten. If the movie did make a mistake, was that it went for the R rating, despite Suicide Squad being a PG-13. I can't say there's a lot to justify the R rating other then more language, the movie is worth a rental or stream. I just can't go crazy enough to recommend it for a theatrical release.",6.0,15 February 2020

Quite better than Suicide Squad,"It's an OK movie. It certainly is coherent in maintaining narrative pressure over Harley Quinn and exploring colors and aesthetics of what they guessed as main interests to her. Some bad aspects of it are poor fighting scenes, which seem hard to believe due to sound attributions and choreography. The pitoresque tone of the movie also can be a bit annoying at times. In comparison with Suicide Squad, this is way better and makes more sense. This may be overlooked to one who is sufficiently impressed by the ""empowering"" tone of the movie. This, I believe, shouldn't be an aspect to be criticised. Also, the fact that critiques that rely on external aspects such as fidelity to sources compromise many of the reviews. If such a critique were valid, we shouldn't have films like Joker (2019). These movies aren't targeted to this niche anyway. So the movie is ok. Not bad nor good, just ok.",6.0,2 April 2020
Boring,This was a disappointing film. It was a series of comic book action sequences shoe horned into a predictable plot. I would give this a wide berth.,1.0,16 February 2020
"It's very messy, but a good deal of it works","I'm not sure it ever quite nails its tone, the humour was about 50/50 hit and miss for me, and Harley herself doesn't feel 100% like a good choice for a lead... at least at first.

The film takes a while to pick up but once it does there's a large chunk of it that's great. I really liked the fractured, non-linear storytelling paired with Harley Quinn's narration. It was genuinely really clever and unique.

Things sag a bit at the start of the third act, when the nonlinear storytelling is replaced with a more traditional style, but things pick up again in the climax, which was pretty great.

Overall, the action is consistently excellent, with great use of slow motion, and fantastic stunt work and fight choreography. There were a few hand to hand fight scenes here that reminded me of The Raid 1 and 2, and that's one of the highest praises you can give an action movie, in all honesty.

There's also a lot of action, which kept things fast paced, and it's never really boring to watch. Most of the cast do solid work, and the characters themselves are simple but largely effective, with enough character development to care about them to some extent.

Also appreciated the bold colours and the eclectic soundtrack.

There's a lot to appreciate- this movie is unapologetically its own thing, and I can't help but compare it to the solid but derivative Black Widow, which is the most recent comic book film I watched before this. Birds of Prey is definitely better.

Even though this didn't always work for me, I liked that it wasn't afraid to have its own voice and do its own thing, and when things click and this movie really works, it's really, really good.

The inconsistent humour, mood whiplashes that aren't pulled off perfectly, and some occasionally exhausting and relentless manic energy keeps me from loving this as a whole, but there's more than enough good here to recommend it anyone else burnt out by comic book movies that lack flair and personality of their own.",7.0,29 September 2021

WHY THIS FAILED,"Harlequin I wanted to enjoy this yet fell short, this movie failed due to, 1. Why was this film rated MA or R, was a cheesy mess of a movie with no dark scenes.If they cut out some parts or changed them would of been a M rated movie.Who let this be released not M rated is stupid.As this is a young girl teen movie. 2. Should of been called Harlequin!!! 3. No Joker or Batman 4. Before this movie came out they where saying it will be another feminist ideology. 5. There was no serious scenes in this movie 6. They tried to make the movie fun,funny,enjoyable!!! ( This is Gotham) 7. Acting fell short (Harlequin over did it) Really could of made a great film, instead they made a kids movie, that kids couldn't see.(Overall had some good action sequences)",6.0,8 May 2020

"Worst big blockbuster since ""Venom""","""Birds of Prey"" was directed by Cathy Yan, starring Margot Robbie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ewan McGregor. After Harley Quinn and the Joker have split up, she joins forces with The Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya in order to save a young pickpocket who stole a diamond from Black Mask.

This is Yan's first big feature film and some of the action is actually well choreographed. Unfortunately that's pretty much all the praise I can give the movie. The action is not horribly edited, however it gets very repetitive very quickly and is simply unnecessary violent.

After Todd Phillips' ""Joker"" grossed over one billion dollars at the box office and was nominated for eleven academy awards (most likely winning 2 or more on Sunday) it was obvious for DC to create an R-Rated Universe that is more suited for adults as an equivalent to Marvel's MCU. The problem about Birds of Prey is that it doesn't understand why the gruesome depiction of violence and the controversy about the movie worked for Joker.

Whether you liked Joker or not it was safe to say that Birds of Prey was highly unlikely to be able to hold up to Joker's hype and its themes about a descent into madness. As a result I went in with quite low expectations, because this movie was being dumped in February most likely with the intention to have its opening weekend overlap with Oscar night and therefore generating as much hype as possible for DC after Joaquin Phoenix's performance in Joker is going to win Best Actor.

Even though I kept my expectations low I was left disappointed with almost every decision of the movie. There is a scene in the first ten minutes of the movie where Harley Quinn jumps on someone else's legs, breaking them. That was the moment I was done and the first of many moments to come that left me shaking my head. The direction, the cinematography and the editing definitely had their moments during some action scenes. The score is decent and the performances are alright, but could have been better if it weren't for very poor writing. The screenplay is neither funny nor is it refreshing or entertaining.

I could go on and on about how much I despise this movie and how much it blatantly failed to match Scorsese's influence on the Joker movie and at one point even calling the villain ""The Godfather"", absolutely disgusting. I would not recommend this movie to anybody.",3.0,6 February 2020
Freckin Fun Flick F**F**F,"DC Comics after their great success on Wonder Woman, a Female Superhero comes with a bunch in Harley Quinn : Birds of Prey. This movie has a Narrow Plot on Protagonist which gets wider when Co-characters introduced on screen as Fellow Partners of Protagonist. Harley Quinn is actually an Antagonist both as in comics and as similar in movie but we can't feel her as like it rather than filled with heroics and fun is my complete assurance. This movie may fail you in Story but not in entertainment. Alongside Harley, Black Canary played by Jurnee Smolett done her best job will share more screen time next to Harley Quinn. Huntress played by Winstead is a deadly assassin with sad past and seek revenge same as like Deadshot, a DC Villain but Cute while in Crew(Birds of Prey). Atlast but not least Harley Quinn is full of Fun and will never miss you to entertain. These are all Positives about the movie along with excellent Stunts and Visuals especially **Best Scene** in rescue of Cassandra is Favourites. While analysing about the movie I mostly felt that major of credits goes to Morgot Robbie played as Harley Quinn is great success for DC universe (fittest in playing Harley Quinn and any no one can replace her) I think they will also felt it as like audience. Watch out for Morgot Robbie's cute expressions and comedy along with other crew Winstead as Huntress and Jurnee as Black Canary performances. Final Verdict : Good and Watchable when you note on my positives",7.0,12 April 2020
"""WOOO! Who's having a good time?""",This movie has a few fun and memorable moments. I think they could've marketed it better because trailers really didn't get me too hyped but the movie ended up being entertaining. Also the soundtrack is not bad.,6.0,30 May 2021
An unexpected violent thrilling roller coaster ride from DCEU,"Birds Of Prey is a versatile experience from DC which deals with the aftermath of Suicide Squad 2016. The movie gets the wildest opening ever with an unexpected silly thing which surprised me a lot. The flick is praiseworthy when it comes to its wild artistic sets,non linear narrative,lighting,cinematography and of course its action sequences which form the core of the movie. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn excels above all with her performance as it felt she was straight out of HQ comic book. Ewan McGregor succeeds in portraying the complexities of the sadistic art lover don and felt terrorizing at times. Jurnette and Mary Winstead although sidelined got moments of their own where they too excel. The third act was not everyone's cup of tea but definitely mine which features a weird action sequence which is something i have never seen before. Last but not the least like a cherry on top of a cake surprises that happened in the end was enough too make my eyes pop out.

When it comes to cons, Birds Of Prey has a simple plot which is narrow compared to previous DCEU outings. Cassandra-Harley chemistry that was supposed to work out did not excel as expected. Rose manages as Renee still she felt as a miscast at times.

In the end, Birds Of Prey is a highly entertaining yet weird action movie which is one of its own kind.

"Fun, entertaining flick","So much better than Suicide Squad. I actually enjoyed this one. If it seems odd to describe a movie with so much graphic violence as a fun joyride, maybe don't watch it because that's what this movie provides.

Decent attempt. DC on the right track here.,"This movie isn't perfect. I didn't like how they portrayed Black Mask or Zaas. However, their comical approach DOES fit the tone quite well. Also, some characters (Huntress especially) deserved a little more screen time.

That being said, this movie is great fun to watch. The mixture of the R rating and cartoonish tone do it wonders and Margot Robbie continues to be fantastic as Harley.

This is the sort of movie Suicide Squad should have been the first time around, if they were wanting to go down the comedy route, and it gives me confidence that the reboot will be significantly better.

So, whilst not perfect and not quite as good as Wonder Woman when it comes to the DCEU, it's still one of their better movies. I'd rate it up there with Shazam, quality wise.",7.0,23 February 2020

As a last note, soundtracks were also powerful.",8.0,3 January 2021
At least it's better than Suicide Squad,"Birds of Prey is an entertaining film that is bogged down by a disjointed, uninteresting and simplistic story. The basic premise is that Harley Quinn is tasked with finding an important diamond for Black Mask within a certain amount of time. Along her adventure audiences are introduced to new characters like Black Canary, Huntress, Victor Zaszz, etc. Margot Robbie excellently portrays Harley Quinn once again and absolutely steals the show. Her comedic wit and performance embodies the fan favorite character perfectly. Ewan Mcgreggor does a great job with the material he was given for Black Mask but ultimately the character didn't feel like his comic book counter part. The same can be said for the rest of The Birds of Prey. Although all the actors do a decent job, their characters are not too memorable or likeable especially compared to the comic book versions. There brief origin stories are to blame due to random flashbacks, brief conversations, and lack of screen time since we follow Harley Quinn for most of the film. The action doesn't disappoint thanks to the John Wick's stunt choreographer's contribution but there were some scenes that are hard for some to suspend disbelief... Black Canary, Huntress, and Harley Quinn beating thugs is one thing but Renee Montoya bearing a 6 ft 200lb thug one on one is too unrealistic even for a superhero film. If you enjoy superhero action movies you won't be disappointed with Birds of Prey. However, if you were hoping for a more team based superhero movie with amazing depictions of other characters besides Harley Quinn, then you will be hard pressed to get that here.",6.0,11 February 2020
A complete failure top to bottom,"This movie is an obvious cash grab. Nothing was spent on backstory and the script. It was a compilation of slow and sloppy fight scenes with the hope that some of the movements and slo-mo would make it cool. It´s clear that the director isn´t good with action (or tone) or drama.

forgettable cash-grab with a tiny bow of wokeness,"A nice-looking forgettable cash-grab tied with a tiny bow of wokeness, didn't win me over. Harley-Quinn is just not a compelling character. I understand some people will like it. Because it is mindless fun. But that's not enough nowadays to make a good movie.

Let's briefly compare this with Deadpool......Deadpool is compelling because it's mostly FUNNY. Lets compare that with John Wick. John Wick is compelling because we can empathize with John after losing his dog. Is this movie very funny like Deadpool, or had some emotional depth where we can empathize with the main character.

It has neither. This movie was made by people who didn't really know how to make it funny or compelling, without tossing in misogyny to blow up some controversy for marketing. I don't care that all the men are bad in the story, and they are! At least make something deeply likeable and endeering about Harley.....which they didn't do. Because Harley is a meme and a trope. She is a sidekick.

It's easy to make a 30 min short story with Harley. If it's silly funny and action packed. But 90 minutes of tropes just doesn't have enough meat to fill the burger. I would have liked to love this movie but it's just another forgettable Comic book movie.",6.0,13 February 2020

Better than my low expectations!,"I went in with extremely low expectations, imagined it would be one of those fast-paced movies you watch just because you have the time. But it's not! I absolutely loved the animated start and the Harley Quinn voiceover, she keeps it amusing and witty at all times. It's almost like watching a female Deadpool, with lower levels of sass. She's a lovable psycho who cares about others, surprise, surprise! I haven't read the comic books, so I didn't really have sky-high expectations, but that's my case with most movies, there's a reason they made the movie, it's supposed to be a treat for everyone. Most scenes in the movie are a pop of colour, and I haven't seen such colourful fight sequences before. It definitely brings in a touch of fun and makes them quirky. Though some characters could do with a better arc.

It's entertaining, vibrant, and witty, fits seemingly well into the Gotham Universe.",8.0,2 July 2021
A Fun Film,"I don't expect much from comic book movies these days, I just hope to at least not be bored, and pleasantly surprised if it's a genuinely good movie. This was entertaining and fun, with a lot of good moments, but the script being a little too all over the place and needing some doctoring stopped it from being a solid win. Yes, I had a great time and got my money's worth...I just saw its potential and could see that the studio dropped the ball where they invest multitudes of time, money, and marketing into their male-led counter parts...yet, many of those still end up being steaming piles of hot garbage.

Of the new DC universe, this is one of the better ones. The action sequences were solid and had some really good moments in a genre that has become very been-there-done-that, with little fresh to add. I really enjoyed Harley's action scene with the bat. That was solid. Margot Robbie was excellent. I really liked her character in Suicide Squad and her acting, performance, and fight scenes were great. Frankly, after seeing this, women are better at action scenes. Their bodies can handle the acrobatics better and make it look more effortless and cool. Kind of like Ben Affleck in the bat suit looking ridiculous and all I can think is this is impossible for him to move under all that massive weight. There's a reason Asian men dominate in action and as action doubles, because their lean frames are perfect for action, just like the female frame is, which is why Gal Gadot and now Margot Robbie look great in those scenes. Marvel and DC should use this to their advantage rather than always sidelining the women. Sure, big dudes punching things has their place but trying to constantly push that these guys who don't have the frames for it are gymnastic or kung fu experts is ridiculous. And for all the men screaming at the computer that women can't fight and it's unrealistic, just remember that MMA cage matches always used to be won by the tiny dudes using jiu-jitsu, bringing down, giant, more impressive looking men. Or the true stories of elderly Filipino men in San Fransisco beating the crap out of multiple gang members with a walking cane as their kali stick.

I also loved the Cassandra Cain character. She was a great sidekick to Harley. She was very endearing and did a good job as far as acting. I wish they could have brought the women together sooner as I wanted to know more about Huntress, and Canary wasn't given enough meat to her character in the time she's on screen. I thought they were a great team and I wish the script could have been more focused on them and less about Black Mask, which, frankly, Ewan was a bit overplayed for me. He was trying too hard to be Joker. He wasn't terrible, but he was a bit distracting and not a good enough villain to match Harley. And I hated Zsasz. I just could not picture that actor as a villain. He wanted to be that guy so much, all I can see is Mindy Project. He overcompensated and his character just didn't fit the film.

The directing was decent and the script was okay. Not bad, it just could have used some help to tighten it up. I feel Cathy Yan has a good future, as the film was pretty good for a newbie. I've seen other female directors advanced to fill the gap who are not quite there yet like Susanna Fogel and Greta Gerwig. Please, I'm not buying all the Gerwig hype, and I enjoyed Birds of Prey far more than Little Women. The style Cathy Yan presented was great. I loved the animated intro and the motion graphics throughout the film. It made it a lot of fun and her style of using animation, slo-mo bits, was overall fresh and fun, and complimented Harley's erratic personality. It had elements of Baz Luhrmann, but not quite as consistent as Baz, but I'm comparing to Romeo and Juliet, where, Baz had a lot more time to craft his skills at that point, and Cathy is a newer director.

While Birds of Prey will not go down in history it was a lot of fun and I would watch a sequel. And despite all the men crying about the injustice on IMDB of this film daring to exist, it is on par with the multitudes of comic book films they are under the delusion are works of art. With some polishing and tightening up the script, Birds of Prey could be DC's answer to Deadpool",7.0,9 February 2020

Loud and Chaotic,"Margot Robbie is brilliant but this character is off the wall (everything is in hyperbole in a screechy, high pitched, New York accent). Much of the storytelling is done inside out (flashbacks to establish the backstories of the ladies). The supporting performances by the Birds of Prey are good and the casting is perfect. Lots of violence and gore, although, I thought the fight choreography is spectacular, especially in the final sequences (I realize this is a minority opinion). All in all the movie was loud and chaotic, the writing and dialogue left a lot to be desired, but the characters were interesting.

Definitely HARLEY FRICKIN QUINN,"Come on now! These reviews I feel are kot really looking at the perspective. Margo I believe completely captures the movement's of Harley Quinn of the cartoon batman, her dialog along with facial expressions. I believe she hit the nail right on the head. The movie itself, with environments, storyline, and narration nail it, with the cartoon to life Story telling. I believe this was a creative way and the best way to approach Harley Quinn, she is by the way THE CLOWNS GIRL! OR WAS. Harley don't come from the psychological twist and turns of the jokers mind, she is just his best asset, and sidekick and we get to see her kick butt on her own, GOTTA SAY HARLEY I COULD WATCH YA DO IT AGAIN!",8.0,13 October 2021
Ignore the HATERS!,"Okay, so as a die hard Harley Quinn fan (and one of her toughest critics) I don't think that Margot Robbie is the best casting choice for her even though I love her as an actress! That being said she definitely did a MUCH better job on her character work in this film than the previous Suicide Squad where she was much more objectified. She seemed to have more freedom to be the silly and fun HQ we all know and love.

My only qualms with the film were that they seemed to just throw in material from the comics with no explanation, which I guess might make them easter eggs? I really would have loved it if Harley would have had a conversation with her taxidermy beaver ""Bernie"" like in the books! I also would have loved to see more of a roller derby scene since that's such a large part of Harley's life in the comics. I also felt that Huntress' character was a bit awkward and flat but she still managed to land some punches! I also wouldn't have minded more blood.

Now I'm not saying this movie is the work of art we've found ""Dark Knight"" or ""Joker"" to be, but it definitely serves it's purpose in being extremely entertaining. When I wasn't busy laughing off, I was completely captivated by the colorful and almost psychedelic like visuals and feel, and completely in awe of the fighting sequences. The film felt like it was almost like viewing the world through Harley's eyes.

I'm really not sure why people are saying this film has a strong feminist agenda or that it's racially biased because I didn't sense that at all! The people saying that must be extremely repelled by women and multiracial people.

The reason for going to the movies is to be entertained and this movie does exactly that! Don't believe it or give into the haters that want to bash this film just so they can feel like their voices are being heard. This was worth every penny and I'd go see it again! 10 stars for reminding me why I love going to the movies and feeling like a kid again (and to help counter all those pointless 1 star ratings)!",7.0,8 February 2020

Exceeded my expectations by a mile,"This movie is an absolute blast from beginning to end. It's very similar to Deadpool. Both have non-linear storytelling, they're irreverent, hyperactive, the lead character narrating the film and they both have meta-humor. The comparisons are fair, but this is not a ripoff of Deadpool. It has that same energy, but it does something different with it. Deadpool is a straight-forward revenge story told in non-linear fashion. This a lot more in common with Guy Ritchie's Lock Stock, Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. It has intersecting narratives dealing with a criminal underground with a MacGuffin the characters are trying to get all told comletley out of order. It's all very interesting and it keeps your mind engaged. It just feels like a fresh and interesting way to tell a story.

Another great thing is the cast. The entire cast is a ton of fun. Two obvious standouts are Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor. Robbie gets to go full Harley Quinn. Of course you get the zany antics, her weird mind and how weridly she interprets the world around her. She gets in on the action and it makes for a ton of great action sequences. She also gets to amoat a lot more. You see the character there and not just the cartoon character. That was a really nice touch that they really made acharacter out of her. McGregor is just so flamboyantly fun yet terrifying at the same time. His character has quirks about how he wants the world to be around him which is so fun to watch while st the same time adds tension into all the scenes.

This might have the best action of the entire DCEU. All of the actions sequences are both beautifully coreographed and shot. It can also be quite brutal. There's a lot of broken legs inside of the film. Harley Quinn is just destroying these guys by going for there knees and it's all very fun to watch. It can also be graphiccally violent. I'm so glad they went for an R rating.

It's also really funny from beginning to end. It's being narrated by Harley Quinn so we're seeing all of this interpreted from her weird perspective. It just finds every single opportunity for a joke.

The bad thing about the movie is that at times it can be a little confusing. With all of the time-jumping and non-linear storytelling I was way more confused than I should have been. This isn't really a big deal, but there are elements of that in the film.

Second bad thing is that Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ella Jay Basco felt like the weak links in the cast. Almost everyone else is really good and for different reasons each of their performances felt a bit off. Basco felt like a younger actress. She's next to some people that are in the Oscar category and she just felt not quite in their league so her delivery wasn't as sharp. Winstead 's character is written to be a bit awkward inside of the story which is a bit of an excuse for this, but her acting for me just felt flat. There was a clever idea that they were doing with her that I just didn't find as convincing as I found everyone else.

But those are very minor issues, but overall, this is a movie that I found incredibly enjoyable and absolutely blew my expectations out of the water.

9/10 you should definetley go see this film.",6.0,8 February 2020

What's up with the hate?,"After reading so many negative reviews of this movie here I finally decided to write my own. So from all the reviews I can say that most of the people haven't even seen the movie. Some are calling it boring but trust me, boring is the only thing the movie isn't. It's a fast paced entertaining package!

The acting is mind blowing by everyone especially Margot Robbie and Ewan Mcgregor (as expected). Huntress is a show stealer and was the biggest surprise for me.

The soundtrack is just amazing and badass. It even surpasses Suicide Squad's soundtrack for me. Every song matches with the storyline and mood.

Now talking about the feminism, trust me there's isn't any. The movie just has 5 female leads and that's all. There's no unnecessary hating on men which others are telling.

This movie is amazing for single viewing for entertainment. If you are looking for something more than entertainment and expect real art, stay away from this.

So at last I'd say

Acting- 10/10 Story- 6/10 Cinematography- 8/10 Action- 10/10 Soundtrack - 9/10 Entertainment- 100/10

"A movie with Margot Robbie, but a pretty colourful one","I'll admit I didn't care about the movie, I only went to the cinema to watch Margot Robbie doing stuff. And Margot Robbie is too beautiful to exist as usual, but she is also a very good actress and in this film she proves it once again. In fact she is the focal point of the plot and she is able to carry a lot of the weight of the movie very convincingly and her Harley Quinn is a fun character that manages to entertain. Other than that the film is very simple, the plot is pretty standard and the only particularity is that it is told with different time jumps. The side characters are barely ok, no one apart from Harley is interesting enough to care for him/her or to root against. Finally the action is good for the entire movie but I found the first part of the last fight a bit confusing and hyperkinetic. To describe badly ""Birds of Pray: and a title that is too long"" is a mixture of a bit of Deadpool and a bit of Kill Bill without the personality of both of them, super colourful and messier. And no I'm not saying that Tarantino and this film are in some way comparable, or even Deadpool, but I think these two movies were a strong inspiration to this one. I spent my money with the intent of reminding myself how incredibly gorgeous Margot Robbie is and that aspect was present so this movie has reached his goal for me. But furthermore, I found myself a bit entertained and due to its simplicity and humor it's probable that it will entertain you as well.",6.0,9 February 2020

Birds of Prey (2020),"Lets face it, the DC Extended Universe has been a mess for the most part. Apart from Wonder Woman, most of the rest has been a misfire. None a big offender than Suicide Squad. That film was awful all around and was just a disaster that no one wants to talk about. I wasn't a fan of Robbie's Harley Quinn in that film so much but she's grown on me over the years as a performer ever since I, Tonya. Birds of Prey is certainly an improvement over Suicide Squad and a better entry for DCEU although its not as good as can be.

The film follows the life of one Harley Quinn. She has broken up with the Joker and seeks a new thrill. She somehow gets involved in trying to recover an expensive diamond for an erratic night club owner Roman Sionis. Along the win Harley butts heads with other woman who all are out to seek justice and break chains that keep them restrained. The film stars Margot Robbie, Ewan McGregor, Rosie Perez, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead.

The film is visually an improvement over Suicide Squad. Its brighter and fun, not as dark and gloomy as Suicide Squad. The action sequences are actually quite good, primarily the last fight in the funhouse. Robbie embodies the character better in this film and doesn't have many cringe induced dialogue like in the previous film. I liked Winstead's character Huntress and the humor attached with her name. The film has narative flaws with it being narrated by Quinn and going back and forth I found this to be a weak and overdone way to do things.

There are passages in the film which are pretty boring, basically as it sets up for the final get together. McGregor chews scenery the whole time he is on screen. Overall, DCEU is still a disappointment for the most part but there are moments here and there worth talking about. This film is very on the nose about its women characters and how they are badass working together. While Birds of Prey isn't anything amazing or remarkable its easily one of the better entries in this universe. If this film makes banks, I'm sure the studio will plan a sequel.

6.5/10",7.0,9 February 2020
This was a waste of characters,"I tried to give this movie a chance. I wanted so bad to be proven wrong that it was just a cash grab political message. I wasn't.

I wanted to like this movie for Margot Robbie's Harley so bad because in my eyes, she's the perfect Harely Quinn, much like Ryan Reynolds is the perfect Deadpool. But... The only good thing in this movie is Robbie's Harley, but it wasn't enough to carry the movie. The rest of the characters were awful. Not a single one was even an attempt at a respectful representation of the comic book character. Might as well have been new made up characters. Awful is putting it lightly. Black Canary, Huntress, Black Mask, Zazz, and Cassandra Cain were not seen in this movie. At all.

To put the cherry on top of this horrible Sunday, the whole movie was filled with man hate, white people hate, and terrible man stereotyping. I would understand some of it to an extent due to Harley being upset at Joker, but the propaganda of the hatred of men was in every aspect of the movie...from all main characters. Too much misandry advertisement and display of disgusting people who happen to be men of course...displaying cliche stereotypical dialogue and actions.

I hope I get to see all these characters again in a different movie and universe, especially Robbie's Harley Quinn. The rest of them need to be forgotten about.",3.0,23 March 2020

"So close to being a really great movie, but...",I'm a DC and Harley fan. The cinematography and the way the story is told by Harley is excellent. The story and action was good. The continuity with the previous DC movies is also good. Lots of references to the comics. The violence and language is excessive. This is a comic book movie. Kids and teens are going to want to see this movie. Most conversations use the f-word alot. How can a movie with good writing not have better dialogue? The violence agaisnt innocent families makes you wish the scenes would just end. Cassandra's character was a complete disappointment. She becomes Orphan in the comics and is an amazing fighter- with a better backstory than you get in BOP.,7.0,9 February 2020
Fun Action Comedy Shows Promise For Batman Universe,"I can't get over how good Birds of Prey was.

You just do not expect the Harley Quinn solo vehicle to be the one to show an original take on the Batman universe. It's more than just Margot Robbie's Deadpool (although it is mostly that). It's an effortlessly girl powered action movie with a solid bulk of stunts and martial arts action.

Margot Robbie has created a larger than life character who seems to have mild super powers. Harley is complex and kind of scummy but has an admirable love of a good breakfast sandwich (the movie's funniest bit) and exudes a raw athleticism as she shoots cops with a riot gun and whacks goons with a hammer.

The first act is a little rocky and watching obsessed Harley go through a breakup starts the movie on a downbeat. But once the other characters the movie becomes a charmingly fast-paced action sit-com. The rest of the cast are great particularly Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary and a surprisingly agile Rose Perez.

This is the direction I'd like to see the DC universe go in. Instead of trying to be over serious, the Batman universe could be fun martial arts flicks (with roller skating and bullet proof corsets).",,9 February 2020
IGNORE THE HATE,"I went into this expecting garbage, based on the reviews on here. I ALMOST didn't bother because multiple people said it was worse than Suicide Squad (which I hated). It's not.

This is not a superhero movie. This is John Wick with ladies. It's not quite as good as John Wick, but still totally worth a watch.

The story is fine, it's nothing mind blowing, but decent. A bunch of criminals and a cop become intertwined because they're all after the same thing. Then team up against the villain. The action is decent, it's not as violent as Wick, but it's that style (great choreography, no crazy fast edits, you can see what's going on). The cinematography and editing were good, and fit the bubblegum punk style.

And Ewen McGregor goes ALL IN. He's so weird it's funny, but not funny bad, funny with how he pulls off such a weird but evil character. There's a bit of mediocre acting, but for the most part it's not bad.

And as far as the criticism that it's just ""man-hating"" garbage, that's so wrong. Yeah, all the men they encounter are scumbags. But also, everyone they're around are criminal scumbags, so what would you expect? In fact, the way men treat women in this movie is probably the most realistic part of it. But the movie is about women. And if you have a problem with the fact that they're kicking the crap out of men... I don't know what to tell you.

I'm not a fan of ""woke"" social justice bullhonkey being inserted into movies, tv, or comedy. This is certainly not that. It's a decent movie that's getting a bad rep. I'm not saying you'll watch it over and over, but it's a million times better than Suicide Squad.",7.0,20 February 2020

Ignore the 'reviewers' who rate 1-5 because the women aren't there to serve their boners,"Dudes who are threatened by this movie are giving themselves away (oooo, self burn - that's rare).

Besides addressing the misogynist reviewers (when majority haven't even seen it!), I have to tell you to go see this movie.

Robbie is am excellent actress. The emotional depth she brought to Suicide Squad finally comes to fruition as she becomes a fully realised character.

Each Bird of Prey team member is given an adequate and satisfying background without feeling like an origin story.

The direction is inspired. It's fun. It's a metaphor for Harley's decay and madness. It's touching.

Lastly, it's funny and gorgeously violent.

I MISS JOKER (JARED LETO),"I enjoyed Suicide Squad, not that I think it was a good movie as far as the plot goes but it was entertaining. That was my first introduction to Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and I wanted more of the character. First let me say that I am a big time fan of Joker (Jared Leto) and I love him and Harley together. That being said Joker was sorely missed and I probably would've enjoyed the movie better had he made an appearance. I know Harley is crazy and over the top but in this she was too OTT and it got to be annoying real quick. The Black Mask/Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor) is supposed to be this scary villain yet he came off completely laughable and I don't mean laugh with I mean laugh at. The Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) might as well have been played by a robot and don't even get me started on Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco). The only character I didn't wanna punch in the face with a brick was Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Ball).",6.0,16 February 2020

Another DC flop.,"Went in on this film with an open mind hoping it would be good. The film spends the entire showing flipping back in time, 'here's a new character to the story oh here's there story', 10 minutes later 'here's another character this is their story'. Fight scenes looked very predictable and you could tell it was this danced out choreography. It's unfortunate that all these dc films can't get any traction and sadly this one is just another one on the list I regret paying to see and won't ever watch again.

"Bad Script, But Good Actress - Birds of Prey","Margo Robbie is quite talented; but not talented enough to raise a film with a garbage script and a mindless plot to an acceptable level of film quality. The four stars for this film are strictly from Robbie's efforts, which were Herculean. Unfortunately, she was stuck in a dreary, boringly violent, and mundane film. The production values were excellent, as were some of the action sequences (a bit reminiscent of The Road Warrior), but it was not enough to save the movie. Robbie has a great future as the living granddaughter of Cyndi Laupner (which is who she reminds me of), and I am sure she will go on to many successes. Hopefully, she will develop romantic screen skills (as there were none in this film), rather than just repetitious violence, which becomes cartoonish when done to excess. (as in WHAM!, SOCK! Holy Batman!). She can do much better with a grown-up script. Unfortunately, the film appears to have been successful enough to encourage the inevitable sequel, which will lock Robbie into the Harley Quinn persona (like Sean Connery as Bond, and was never able to break out of that role until The Untouchables). She will probably make a lot of money if she continues in this role, but my advice would be to break out of this role as quickly as possible if she wants to be considered a serious actress (and she has the talent to be one).",4.0,13 February 2020
Fun movie,"Birds of Prey has a good cast and solid acting. While it isn't perfect, with a weak story and some noticeably big clichés, the film still entertains with fun action, a good amount of charm, and a somewhat likable characters. The performances are amazing, Margot Robbie is Harley Quinn, she's totally having fun with her character but I find the her voice-over narration to be annoying. Ewan McGregor owns the role of Black Mask, he's very menacing as the villian. Mary Elizabeth is absolutely memorable in her performance as Huntress. Jurnee Smollett performance's as Black Canary is also noteworthy. The set designs are a bit more digestible to the eyes and the VFX are good. There are hardcore action scenes as well as many comic and light hearted scenes. The movie shifts well from the violent action scenes to the light hearted scenes which is a good thing. The set pieces are spectacular and dynamic but the one in the funhouse is too silly to be good. The soundtrack is amazing as it intensifies and adds energy to the scenes.

On the whole, Birds of Prey is a lot of fun and action-packed. Great costumes, amazingly shot with beautiful production design and good performances.",7.0,31 December 2020
The 7 is for Margot Robbie,"Bird of Prey (2020) : Margot Robbie will always be the best playing Harley Quinn, the accent, the attitude , the craziness and her fights is what made me want to see the movie. And she didn't fail to entertain. However, the story was a little all over the place going back and forth in the telling of it. I'm not a fan of going back to a scene for at least half an hour to explain why the other scene is happening and it happened twice. It was annoying. I'm used to seeing Ewan Mcgregor As the good Obi-wan-Kanobe and in a romantic role. See I g him as a villain didn't sell it for me unfortunately- the mask looked like a dark version of Jim Carey's the mask - that's what I kept thinking staring at it. And I absolutely love Jurnee-Smollet-Bell (She was on full house as a kid) but because of not so great directing I felt she came in short as the Black Canary and her power wasn't given much attention in the movie . And No No No to the Huntress casting. She was awful, I don't know if it was her bad acting or was it bad writing or directing. Unfortunately the birds of Prey weren't as strong as I thought they would be. The fight scene choreography could've have been more interesting but it got boring at times - exception is Harley Quinn she had a real good couple of fight scenes that got me like whoa .. but the birds of prey were Meh.

Leveling Suicide Squad up - and owning it,"Despite major criticisms towards Suicide Squad, it seems that DC wouldn't just let it be a mistake to leave behind and be embarrased by. They chose to keep a lot of the same elements (most of which were the ones highly enjoyed in SS) and elevate them and turn them into this crazy carnival ride, where Harley Quinn will find herself and gather a team next to her. And despite many people's worries, I think the movie does a great job of seperating the Birds of Prey from Harley. Make no mistake, this is obviously a Harley Quinn movie. But by the end, you'll see just how she managed to make something that will be able to stand on its own which is just amazing. Let's face it, that just wouldn't have happened on the big screeen in the next ten years without the help from the iconic Harley Quinn (movie) character. They could totally do a spin-off alone with the Birds now - or maybe still keep Harley in a smaller role (Gotham City Sirens leading up to?).

In the end, I think the movie succeeded in exactly what it wanted to be. It wanted to be a trip. It wanted to be a Harley Quinn origin story. It wanted to be a Birds of Prey origin story. It wanted to be a story about finding yourself after losing your identity (relationship, job, safety, vengeance road). Incorporating all of that means chaos...but that is the point of this Harley Quinn's character exactly. The movie is through her mind. And you just have to stick along and enjoy the chaos unfold in a delightful and sharp manner and explosion of colors... and other stuff.

Note: I've heard several complaints about this Harley Quinn character being so different or not as good as the comic book ones or the one(s) in the animated show(s), sidecharacters not being treated with respect etc.... Honestly, people, just because this is a movie and it's given a big budget, it's still just a singular version of the character(s). Like in any other platform. Why should it try to copy (which, it still does borrow a lot and pay homage several places)? You wouldn't say that if this was a new comic book series with Harley and the Birds of Prey, would you now. Anywhere you start new, you start new. You don't just copy. (*cough cough* Lion King remake *cough* I mean live action version.) Enjoy every version for themselves please, I'm sure they all have good sides and bad sides you can take something from, and the approach here is clearly working for what DC has been wanting to do with their cinematic universe. Which IMO we all are being way too hard on. You don't see the same kinda pressure with the often formularic Marvel movies (with all the respect to them and what they are trying to do), so it should only be fair to show some respect and mercy where more creativity and risks are the things being prioritized. Right? This is just one version, not more and not less credit to it than any other version - just more people will probably see it because it's the mainstream one. And this cinemac universe will keep expanding in all layers. Remember to have fun. The movie is very inviting of that.",10.0,7 February 2020

It's a cute watch!,"Didn't know what to anticipate when watching this film but had read one bad review about it not having much of a plot which I agree. The plot line is weak and somewhat boring the only thing that holds the movie together is the fight scenes other than that it seems messy. The film feels like they wrote a soundtrack then produced the film it's almost like a musical and even though the album is great as I had listened to it before the movie release it was just TOO present in the film throughout. I feel like they should of included the joker even if it was for 30 seconds at some point in the film; his absence as a ""they broke up"" excuse just wasn't enough to make the movie seem like that was now the cause of everything that unfolded that suddenly everyone wants revenge because Harley isn't protected anymore. Harley is bad as anything and I feel she doesn't need the Joker as she should have her own reputation by now. Birds of Prey film title makes no sense either until they decided last minute to make it relevant. I almost feel like we need a second film but scrap whatever happened in this film and maybe go thoroughly in depth in a unique way like the independent joker film how Harley became who she is present day and why there is no chance she can go back to life before. They show a cartoon brief breakdown at the beginning but it has so much more potential.

I mean any other film made now featuring Margot as Harley would probably still be better than this. I only like it because the costumes are fun, Harley looks expensive than she did in suicide squad plus it's her feature film so we see her 100% the soundtrack slaps and as a woman I feel like it would be cute to watch every once in awhile with snacks. And these are everything that's wrong with the film, I shouldn't like it for those basic reasons.",7.0,11 February 2020

It's supposed to be some kind of empowering film for women yet it downplays all the women in it.,1.0,16 May 2020

Oh DC......why do you keep missing the mark?,"This is the story of Ms. Harley Quinn that takes place after the event of Suicide Squad (which was a far better movie). She and the Joker have split and she is trying to find her place in the world. Many people hope to kill her or arrest her for her action while under the protection of Joker. She cuts a deal with one of the most dangerous gangsters in Gotham to retrieve a young pickpocket that stole a large diamond with some very important account numbers etched onto it. She is joined by a rouge cop (shocker) and The Huntress and Black Canary. The opening sequence and first ten minutes was great with a lot of laughs. The final twenty minutes was also great with a lot of action. Everything else in between was a disjointed, boring mess. Margot Robbie was definitely born for this role as she embraces it fully and brings Ms. Quinn to vivid life. I find it utterly frustrating that the writers for the DC movies cannot get their collective heads out of their butts. The shows on the CW are far superior to almost every offering to the DC universe in the form of movies. I was so excited when they announced this film.

Entertaining but falls flat in most important areas.,"""Birds Of Prey"" offers sheer popcorn entertainment for nearly two hours, but falls flat in the most important areas such as screenplay and storyline. . In this superhero action film, Harley Quinn joins forces with a troupe of crime fighting women to save a young girl from Gotham crime lord Black Mask. . There is no one more fit for the lead role than Margot Robbie; she portrays Harley Quinn so well that she becomes the character. I think the performances in ""Birds Of Prey"" are great, especially from Robbie but Ewan McGregor as Black Mask really stood out for me. A vicious and over the top role that only McGregor could play. Aside from its flaws, the film is action packed and solid but it needed a rewrite. Filled with loose dialogue and not enough backstory, it feels like ""Birds Of Prey"" was relying solely on explosons and blood for entertainment's sake. .

Fantabulous.,"Introduced in the much-maligned Suicide Squad back in 2016, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn was easily one of the most likeable aspects of the film, so it makes sense that she gets her own film in the DCEU, Robbie herself serving as producer for the project. Ever since the hot-mess that was Justice League, Warner Bros. have learnt their lesson and have given us some light and fun superhero films but can they keep that trend going with Birds of Prey?

Free from her relationship with the Joker, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) sets about living her best life for herself. With knowledge that she is no longer with the Clown Prince of Crime, it's not long before she finds herself a target for those she has wronged, including crime lord Roman Sionis/Black Mask (Ewan McGregor).

Make no mistake, despite the title being Birds of Prey, this is very much a Harley Quinn film, with the titular team not coming together until the final act. It's a film based around the idea of Quinn being free from the hold of the Joker and finding herself in a city full of deadbeats and whackjobs, yet it never feels as if they're trying to shove any messages down your throat. Christina Hodson's writing may not be the greatest but it does serve up a lot of fun dialogue and sequences that Cathy Yan directs quite wonderfully.

Yan reached out to Chad Stahelski, the director of the John Wick franchise, to help choreograph the action sequences and the results are simply stunning. They let loose with the craziness for sure in all of the sequences, violence and wide shots aplenty as we get to comprehend what is happening, a trend I'd love to see continue in action films these days.

Serving as a producer for the film means Margot Robbie works hard both in front of and behind the camera, her performance in Birds of Prey completely embodying the chaotic nature of Harley Quinn. It's one of those performances where you can just tell the actor loves playing the role and that feeling is infectious to the audience watching her. Being a female-centric superhero film means Robbie is joined by the likes of Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Rosie Perez, all serving as fierce independent characters that can mix-it with the scum of Gotham. Winstead and Smollett-Bell are definitely two I'd like to see more of in future films. Ewan McGregor plays the main villain of the piece and he's clearly having a ball too, bringing out both the flamboyant and psychotic nature of the character very well.

Birds of Prey manages to keep the momentum going for the DCEU, joining both Aquaman and Shazam! in being an absolute blast that focuses on having fun rather than moping around in doom and gloom. I'd certainly love to see more of Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and with her wanting to bring the Gotham City Sirens to the big screen, I think it'd be a mistake by Warner Bros. to not make that come true.",8.0,8 February 2020
The Birds deserved better.,"This movie had all the right ingredients but the story was all over the place, the music was forgettable and the stellar cast couldn't shine through the crummy stunts.

If you can't make magic with her and the rest of the cast, you didn't try.",6.0,11 March 2020
All in all a bit meh.,"Well, where start?

It's all a bit less than average. I was hoping for more as Margot Robbie in Suicide Squad was definitely the best part of that film.

As for Birds of Prey, it was a bit of a mess really. The plot was dull and rather boring. Ewan McGregor as a bit all over the place either really nasty or comic book villain, but it just felt like they couldn't decide on what best to do with any of the characters. One moment it was comic, next moment really dark.

Overall not really sure what I sat down and watched. As most of the characters were shallow and predictable, action shots were so, so. But I guess I've been spoilt by the likes of John Wick, Don't waste your money at the cinema on this one.",3.0,16 February 2020

Robbie is also awful trying to give a comedic performance - her performance is so bland and lifeless that it is embarrassing. The supporting cast is beyond idiotic. The writer destroyed Huntress and Black Canary and instead of making them nice strong characters she made them a mockery with terrible performances and dialogue.

Could have been a masterpiece,"Okay, so, first things first. As a fan of huntress, I really wish there was more of her in the movie. She is an interesting character, the actress was good and she even had some pretty fun moments, but too little screen time. The rest of the movie is a fun ride, but fails to be anything other than that. The feminist theme is very clear in the entire run, which was something I liked. All of the villains are men and they are all mad, no exceptions, and the men are mad, but you get where they were going with that. The problem is that they all become one dimensional. Black Mask, the big bad, is just a violent misogynistic creep, and that's it. Aside from that, the old trope of one foe attacking at a time instead of banding together and attacking at once makes some of the fight scenes kind of boring, predictable and silly.

"Colourful and generally fun, but also slightly all over the place","Party a follow up to ""Suicide Squad""; Harley Quinn has ended her relationship with The Joker and is attempting to build a life of her own - but it seems that everyone is after her for one thing or another. She has a 'sort-of' plan to make a name for herself, but that plan isn't the most thought out plan - but this is Harley Quinn; she'll just deal with what's in front of her and do the best she can.

Margot Robbie once again dons on the neon attire and pale face of Harley Quinn. She's joined in the film by characters from the DC Universe that comic fans will certainly be aware of, some make up the 'Birds of Prey', others are more criminally minded such as Roman Sionis and Victor Zsasz.

How do I start this review then? Well... err... the film is a bit of a mess. It actually feels like an intentional mess to align with the Harley Quinn character and mindset. It is difficult to follow a linear plot as there are so many potential plots floating around that it's difficult to know which one will unfurl - normally that challenge would be a good thing, not here I'm afraid. I do not think the script was that strong, it felt very throwaway without much development or depth for the characters. The cast seem to do a decent enough job with what they are given, but not to the point where the audience feels that engaged. While Robbie was the central character, I found more interested in the Huntress character brought to scree by Mary Elizabeth Winstead - until she teamed up with Harley Quinn that is.

I enjoyed it, but it felt like it was trying to be something it wasn't. The most successful R rated anti-hero film thusfar (IMO) is ""Deadpool"" and this film felt like it was trying to follow a style like that. Colourful and chaotic, randomly breaking the 4th wall, lots of violence and tongue in cheek humour. The DC Universe has learned and improved on ""Suicide Squad"", but this felt like it wouldn't be out of place next to pre-Nolan Batman films - I could easily have believed it if George Clooney turned up as a nippled Batman, chasing Arnold Schwarzenegger while avoiding freeze-ray blasts. It was nice to see a generally female centred film, but I think this was an opportunity missed rather than a mark made to change the way superhero/anti-hero films are handled.

not as bad as people make it out to be,"So I'm a somewhat avid youtube user and the youtube male drama scene made the movie out to be way worse than it actually is, probably because of how the movie or ewan mcgregor promoted it. What I believe went wrong with how he promoted it is he tried to compensate for what a psycho and slight misogynist he's playing in birds of prey, and wanted to make sure that people don't perceive him that way off the screen xD.

The movie is lacking that special something to be an 8 but it's definitely not a 6. Cinematography, acting, visuals are top-notch. The only thing lacking is Gotham's grittiness (in certain scenes, they seem to be jumping back and forth, I'm not sure how I feel about it). Visually the movie is great, especially the scene where she enters the police station.

Story-wise it isn't any worse either. I'm rating this as someone who hasn't read the comics and we always have to be realistic: it's very hard to translate comics into film.

She splits up with Joker (and funny enough the Joker that I'm seeing is Jared Leto most probably because of Suicide Squad (can't stand that guy)) and the whole town is out for revenge mainly because she was Joker's girlfriend and now a bunch of psychos want to exact revenge on her personally, and for still being somewhat of a proxy to the Joker. All in all I thought this movie would be way worse. I've seen worse SJW in the MCU. I haven't actually planned to watch the movie given all the drama it came with, but I thought I would give it a try.

The only other thing I would complain about is the lack of stunt-doubles they used. It's very admirable that the actors did most of the stunts and fighting choreography themselves but it's really hard to remove the human physical slowness and show fast and fluid hero-like movement in fighting scenes. In that regard it looks a bit dated.

The title is fitting, Joker splits from her and she's tries to redefine her life. I'm not the biggest fan of ewan either, but he played the psycho really well.",7.0,6 May 2020

This movie is fine. You guys are just mean.,"Now, I haven't done this since Batman v Superman, but I've been such a big fan of the recent DC movies that I actually went out of my way to see Birds of Prey in the first-run theatre, even though it's a sequel to Suicide Squad, which I hated. How was it? It was good! However, I didn't enjoy it as much as the other recent DC movies. It's not as campy or creative as Aquaman, it's not as funny or heartfelt as Shazam! and it's not as mature or gritty as Joker. It has all of those elements, but I didn't think they were as strong. I enjoyed it about as much as Wonder Woman. It's quite good, but I think it could've been better. I wasn't really into the story structure of the film. It was really weird, the first half of the movie or so is told in a nonlinear way with Harley Quinn narrating over everything. It jumped around a little too much for my liking. I also think the narration is overused, it got a little old after a while. There were also some weird editing choices, but it wasn't NEARLY as bad as Suicide Squad! There were also too many characters, it's both a Harley Quinn solo movie and a Birds of Prey origin story. I'm not really sure why they did that. Just Harley would've been enough to carry the film, the other characters weren't as interesting and the movie kinda drags whenever it focuses on them. If it were up to me, I would've retooled the story a bit to include Catwoman and Poison Ivy instead of the Birds of Prey and make it a Gotham City Sirens movie. Though, again, the ensemble cast of the movie is handled way better than Suicide Squad. Finally, this movie did not need to be an R. There's just some violence that could easily be toned down and some swearing that could easily be cut. It feels like a movie that would appeal most to teenagers, but (in the States at least) they can't see it. It's not like Joker, which really earned the R-rating with its subject matter. I don't feel like Birds of Prey really did. This movie would reach a wider audience if it were rated PG-13. Also, I don't like the title. It's too long and doesn't sound good or interesting to a casual audience member. However, with all that said, this movie is a lot of fun. It's very colourful and good-looking and it takes place in a very cool version of Gotham City. You actually get to see people being nice to each other on a beautiful sunny day, as well as the darkness and violence that you would expect from a Batman movie. This movie has some laughs, is well-acted and the action is well-done. When the real story actually gets going, it's engaging and entertaining. Harley Quinn is a great lead character and the movie has a good soundtrack. The villains are also very enjoyable! Oh yeah, and I LOVED the opening with the hand-drawn animation! Also, even though this is a sequel to Suicide Squad, it does stand on its own and no Jared Leto Joker is to be found! The Joker is in this movie, but they use the comic/animated series design. That was funny. I also think it's funny to imagine this movie as a sequel to Joker. Just a fun thought experiment. Overall, I do think the movie is holding itself back. I was expecting something more along the lines of Scott Pilgrim or Baby Driver, something with really creative and over-the-top action with great characters and comedy. However, I can't fault the movie for what it isn't and, for what it is, this is a good movie. I recommend giving it a watch, especially if you're a Harley Quinn fan.",7.0,29 February 2020

Forget the seriousness and enjoy two hours of fun,"Comic lovers are usually fanatics. They try their imagination to be in the movie and it is not always possible for many reasons. I read lots of comic. Some of them become complete different movies. Both were acceptable aside for the differences. Margo Robbie comes back as Harley Quinn, Jokers girlfriend; but spite the familiarity and relation of these characters do not expect social / psychological drama like JOKER. This is a dark comedy!!!. Yes there are some embedded messages about ""machismo"" and all men are betrayers (in fact every men in the movie betrays somebody and the main bad guy is gay. Women on the other side, help each other unconditionally. The story is a back and forth mess mixed with cartoons, inserted graphics and Harley talking to the audience; everything looking for a comic effect that mostly succeed. At the end is basically a satire about comic and superheroes (or supervillains) loaded with almost non stop burst of absurd and/or strong violence, mostly bloodless and absolutely sexless (violence good sex bad, Hollywood culture). The movie is kinetic enough to keep your attention. Robbie and Ewan McGregor (as the apparently gay villain) deliver performances switching from scary to comedy or drama with incredible ease. Perhaps are no Oscar worthy but are quite solid. Jurnee Smollett-Bell does a very good physical character. I believe is somebody to follow. Rosie Perez looks lost and no happy. I do not understand why. Mary Elizabeth Winstead has a few comic moments but her character is very underwritten. Rest of the characters are mostly stunt doubles.

It is important to mention that there is a substantial stunt work making even the most absurd scenes believable. It is fresh air over Disney mostly digitally animated Marvel sagas.

In brief; not Oscar worthy but plenty of fun",9.0,7 February 2020
Birds of Prey,"Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), abandoned by the Joker, joins up with others to defeat the very nasty gangster Black Mask (Ewan McGregor).

One Of The Better DC Movies & Loads of Fun,"It's a shame that this is underperforming & seems to have a hate campaign against it. I am a man and I thought this movie was just a lot of fun. It's true that the story is all over the place but unlike the unintentionally disjointed mess which was Suicide Squad I believe this one was intended to be a disjointed mess in that it is being told through Harley's narrative. The fight scenes are well done and showcase Harley's skills more than what has been shown before. It is true what some have said about the opponents kind of being mindless lunks, including the police but how many of these movies are there where this isn't the case? Aside from Gordon were any of the other cops in TDK geniuses? It is also true to all of the men in the film are bad but from my memory that is only 3 men. This just wasn't the place for any heroic men and to include them would have changed the story. The bottom line is don't let the negative reviews keep you away. At least see it for yourself and you might just enjoy it as I did and as I know several other people who saw it did as well. It's a good time at the theater so at the very least it is the second best thing in the DCEU next to WW.

Complete waste of time and money! 3/10,"Review: I really didn't enjoy this film. The ridiculous action scenes and silly jokes really got on my nerves and Margot Robbie went a bit overboard as the crazy Harley Quinn. Ewan McGregor (Roman Sionis) was also a terrible baddie, and the soundtrack made the whole film seem like a bit of a joke. On the plus side, the Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) was brilliant and the chemistry between the girls, when they joined forces, was half decent but it's hard to find anything else positive about the film. As the DC franchise is in a right mess at the moment, this film really doesn't help matters, which is a shame because it sounded promising on paper. If they do agree to make another movie, they really need to tone down Harley Quinn, who seemed more mentally disturbed than anything. The whole back and forth in time thing was also annoying and the way that the girls took out big grown men with ease, made me cringe. As I haven't read the comics, I don't know how close this Harley Quinn is to the written one, but from an entertainment point of view, I really found it hard to watch. As far as I am concerned, if your going to have an action-packed movie with wit, the least that they could do is make it funny. Anyway, I won't be watching this movie again in a hurry, and it has to go down as one of the biggest let-downs of this year. Disappointing!

Round-Up: This movie was directed by Cathy Yan, who also brought you a movie called Dead Pigs, which I haven't seen or heard of. Now I know that these big studios are supporting these new up and coming directors, by giving them big-budget movies to work on as there first projects, but with DC in so many problems at the moment, they really needed someone in Christopher Nolan's league to save the franchise. I know that they wanted to make this an ""all-women"" affair, in terms of starring and working on this film, but I personally think that the final product was awful. The whole thing just seemed silly and unfunny, but it still made a decent profit at the box office, even though we are in the middle of a pandemic. With the critics and a majority of audiences around the world, completing slating the movie, I wonder if the big wigs behind the DC universe will finally listen to us because it's obvious that they are wasting time and money on these movies, which are definitely not working.

And the hero of this film is a narcissistic, violent, psychopath who loves egg sandwiches, isn't that cute, funny quirky and irreverent, laugh! You non-progressive oppressor. Btw, in what way was she emancipated? She had no restrictions on her behavior at any point, she makes no growth as a character, the one thing she does get over is her breakup with the Joker, but we never see him or the dynamic of their relationship, no codependency, abuse, nothing hinted at that she suffered from and then later overcame through the course of the movie. Leaving all of the subtext and messaging aside, the movie on its own merit isn't good. The villain couldn't be any weaker and more forgettable, the characters are paper thin because there are too many of them to flesh out and the whole poop out the diamond storyline, what is this a 1980s TV show? It's uninspired, unimaginative and dated. I can't think of one memorable scene in this movie I liked and no I can't get into fight scenes in which 200lb stuntmen fly around trying not to accidently hurt 120lb women in heels, makeup and wigs. How are they able to break bones or knock them out with one blow? There's no context in terms of rigorous training or super strength or agility. No, they're kicking their butts with feminism and if you don't like it you must hate women. Good luck with that marketing and trying shame people into liking your movie WBs, because it worked so well with Ghostbusters. It may sound like I didn't enjoy this film, but if it had a little bit more narration it might have swayed me, there were 2mins or so of screen time in which there wasn't any narration either telling me what I was about to see with my own eyes or trying to fill in holes in the swiss cheese storyline in postproduction. At least Suicide Squad was just a bad movie, this is a bad movie that makes you feel like Alex in a Clockwork Orange. You'd better watch and see what a terrible person you are for having a penis and if you don't I'll tell the world it's because you're scared of empowered vaginas. I wonder how all of the people that made, support or just enjoyed this film would feel about it if all of the gender roles were switched and if the answer is, they've already seen Hollywood make those films, then I hope they have enough self-awareness to then understand how I felt watching this.",1.0,26 March 2020
Terrible,There were a hundred ways they could have made a good Harley movie and they chose this feminazi garbage.,,28 March 2020
BIRDS OF PREY is a messy enterprise that cannot extricate itself from its stock tropes and the jejune comic book contents,"""Self-parodying references are legion, McGregor's historic villain mannerism is utterly derivative and cringeworthy (culminating in the scene where Roman bullies a female patron in his clip joint, a cameo by Bojana Novakovic, the nearest thing we can obtain from visceral acting in the whole shebang), the psionic power of Dinah Lance aka. Black Canary (Smollett-Bell) is roundly inconsistent with whatever has happened thus far, Rosie Perez's Renee Montoya is the carbon copy of a wronged detective from any '80s bad cop movie, and she duly plays as a one, only here she is a middle-aged lesbian, but queer sexuality still remains a taboo in the mainstream superhero universe, only faint homoerotic implications are hinted between Roman and his BFF Victor Zsasz (Messina), however, in the face of the waving flag of the coalition of a ""united girl power"", any sexuality (queer or otherwise) is left cowardly untapped.""

It's smaller and more compact than some other DC films have been, but the wonderful performances from these amazing actresses, great direction from Cathy Yan, and Ewan McGregor clearly having the time of his life all make Birds of Prey stand out, and deliver from a script that may have been less entertaining if the right people didn't have their hands on it.",7.0,10 March 2020
So incredibly entertaining,"This movie was fabulous. Margot Robbie and her birds of prey are amazing in their strong, kickass, humorous, and sexy way. The movie is so colorful and looks really fantastic. Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis/Black Mask is very menacing and also a joy to watch.

The third act drags a bit but it makes up for it with almost 40 minutes of straight hysterical action, and I really mean that. The action is awesome, easily the best of any DC-movie, and there's a lot of it. The characters are so fun and a lot of their moments are also quite touching.

"""Deadpool Dumped the Joker""","Average watch at best, might watch again, and can't recommend.

There are several ways to look at this movie: 1) From a sequel stand point. 2) From a comics stand point. 3) From a stand alone movie stand point.

1) Sequel stand point THERE IS AN ENTIRE MOVIE MISSING! This is the 3rd part of the ""Harley Quinn Trilogy"". We're missing an entire transformation of a character from one thing to another for this movie to even be able to happen. And if you're picking at that thread, then there is probably 2 or 3 movies before ""Suicide Squad"".

2) From a comics standpoint OMG, they pooed all over almost every concept they borrowed from the comics. -Harley leaving the Joker- This was a huge Gotham event, not from a Gotham standpoint, but in the revolution and rebirth of a character that literally is left out of the story here. -Birds of Prey- Never mentioned in the movie, they come together our of necessity, like the Avengers, when the original concept was orchestrated by Oracle who hand picked women in the vigilante field to help her, but at least they included the originals, Huntress and Black Canary -Huntress- I've never loved Mary Elizabeth Winstead more, but they turned the ""Crossbow Killer"" vs Huntress thing into a really poor joke, making her seem sad instead of powerful, when should be saying, ""I am the Huntress"" to install the fear of the name into criminals as she was a killing vigilante, the only reason Batman wouldn't work with her, and a main contention with Oracle. -Black Canary- I understand that there are WAY too many white characters, but the solution is not to ""wash"" characters, just create new characters that help balance out the whole pool. Jurnee Smollett is awesome, and she does a great job, but she's not the same Black Canary that I know, that was an international spy / mercenary (basically an American Black Widow). The gritty reboot is good, I'd just rather it be her own character and have it stand on her own awesome footing. -Cassandra Cain- What a creative way to ruin a future Batgirl movie. And that has to be what it is. They some contention with someone else wanting the rights (or they're elapsing) and we're seeing what happened to Spiderman and Venom, they're using the name so someone else can't. She was supposed to be the assassin turned vigilante, the daughter of Deathstroke, raised in the League of Shadows, but sure 2 bit pickpocket works. -Harley Quinn- They are all over the place with her, from helpless girl to badass to bad fighter to lucky only to clueless to amazing intellect, to violent psychopath to emotional friend. Pick a lane. And the ""word on face"" thing didn't go over well with Joker, not sure why the kept such a distraction when her face is already the symbol with which she garners the desired attention.

3) Stand alone movie I hate the stupid way they jump around with the story: I didn't like in in ""Pulp Fiction"" where it had purpose, I doubt I'll ever like it anywhere else.

That aside, this is actually pretty great, they spent a lot of money to get the production value where it needs to be, the cast is awesome, the story (when understandable) is pretty good, and the characters are entertaining as hell, even if Harley Quinn now seems to be a lot more Deadpool than I want.

Most of its problems are just that it is trying to be a Gotham Knights, DC movie when it absolutely doesn't have to be. Using names that people don't recognize and giving them a different experience only turns your great movie into a good movie.

I miss the days when people just made a thing they thought was good and saw if they were right. All this spreadsheet analysis of world wide information is definitely skewing movies, and we haven't even been doing it long enough to see if it's really effective measurement.

Long-short: it's a good enough movie to be potentially great if you just pretend you know nothing about anything else.",6.0,1 September 2020

The movie is manic, more like a cartoon come to life, with bright colors and characters doing some impossible things. All in all it is very entertaining. With one BIG exception, it is filled with dirty language, not just incidentally but ongoing, and in all too much of it. That takes away from the enjoyment and lowers my own rating of the movie. Too much salt and pepper can ruin any good steak.

Harley and the rest,Movie with really good action and good story. Little slow start but it gets good. final act was kinda dumb and average but rest was really good and funny. Ewan did excellent job as the main antagonist. Rest of the characters were kinda thrown aside yo focus more on Harley even tho some of them had interesting backgrounds. If those characters get own movies (at least some of them) i'd say this movie could be 8/10 maybe even 9/10 depending how they do them,7.0,8 February 2020
"I didn't love it,, but it's plenty enjoyable enough,,,","First off,, Margot Robbie is and always will be the perfect Harley Quinn. That's it. She was obviously born to play the role (not that it's the only one she can,, she's good in everything she does). She outshines in every scene (and that's saying a lot, cause it's a great cast).

The rest of the cast is also really good in this one. Perez, Smoulett, Winstead, McGregor, (actor who played Zzasz), and then some. They're all really good at their parts.

Some of the bad,,, this movie is very much about how men are bad and such. Now don't get me wrong,, I luv women (well,, most). Men and Women are completely equal,,,, just different. So, yes, the feminist movement is strong with this one,,, ugh.

Also, McGregor as Black Mask was, not bad at all, but not overly memorable either. Granted, this is a villan I don't know much about,, but still, I expected more villany and less night club owner. He comes across as a loon, for sure, but also a bit spoiled and bratty as well.

Now,, back to the good. Like I said before,, Robbie as Harley Quinn. Smollett-Bell shines as Black Canary in this one. Winstead is good as huntress (would've liked to have seen a lot more of her,,, although we saw more of her than we did of Leto as the Joker in SuicideSquad). Perez rounds out the female cast as the smart cop who has to go outside the law to save the innocent kid (well,, maybe not innocent,,, but she doesn't deserve what's coming her way).

The soundtrack is perfect,, like with Suicide Squad (which I really liked,,, don't know what everyone's problem was with that).

So,, all in all it's an enjoyable movie to watch.

*** coming back after my 2nd (or 3rd) viewing a couple yrs later.

Everything I said above is still what I think now. Not bad at all / enjoyable enough / worth a watch. I'd give it a 6.5 rating overall. Despite the great cast, it just didn't work as well as it should've. Direction, writing, pace, etc were the problems. Also, the narrating by HQ, while funny, also added to the problems imo (maybe they did that in the animated shows, idk, but it was a detriment in live action imo). Whatever happened, it just didn't work as well as anticipated. Still fun, though (just don't think too hard, and enjoy).",6.0,28 March 2020

"""A wacky feminist comic book film with a tepid climax!""","This film which is based around the DC Comics Universe, narrates the quirky story of Harley Quinn, the psychomaniac girlfriend of the Joker, after her breakup with him. A young girl named Cass is on the hitlist of Roman Sionis A.K.A. Black Mask, the supervillain of Gotham city and Harley gets entangled in it. Three other characters - Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya enter the picture and what follows is an adventure packed ride, paired with crazy action turning the whole city upside down!

Opening up with a cartoon graphic animation which gives a brief background of Harley's past, the screenplay unfurls in a fast paced manner as Harley herself does the narration of events. The nonlinear fashion with which it unfurls along with a good dose of fun, action and craziness, captures the viewer's attention.

The film explores the emancipation of Harley as she tries to cope up with her breakup. It particularly unravels her liberation from the deep psychological stress that she undergoes, eventually getting unchained to unleash her true colours of fury & madness! Her standout attitude along with some of her demented interpersonal views is shown quite splendidly.

It's really exciting to watch the characters display some wacky non-stop swift action, building up the curiosity of the viewer for the final showdown with the villain. However it kind of fails to live up to the expectations, with a rather tepid climax scene along with having quite a predictable outcome.

Margot Robbie as Harley, gives out an eye catching performance with her tremendous rushes of energy and intense emotions. Jurnee Smollett Bell also stands out as Black Canary with her hot looks and impressive acting. Chris Messina as Black Mask's sidekick has performed really well and he carries out his cruel & rabid looks fabulously.

Overall, this movie really stands out with several bouts of psychotic craziness and a good dose of action, however it's got some disappointment as it ends up with the expectations not living up! A one time watch can be recommended if you're a fan of the DC movie franchise.",6.0,11 February 2020

Another DC movie that shows they're improving,"Most movies have that one thing that all critics mention in their review of the movie and for this one, I have a good feeling that it's going to be the action sequences because they were on par with John Wick. I honestly can't say I've seen action sequences this well-done since John Wick in recent years. Every single action scene is well thought out on how it's all going to go down and how to keep everything in frame and use as little edits as possible. There are so many great action sequences that just show off how badass all of these women are. The women wouldn't be badass if they had weak actresses playing them and this movie does not have them. Everybody in this movie was outstanding in the acting department with some being obvious and others not so. The main stand out to me was Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. In Suicide Squad she was one of the good elements in that movie and she just further proves it in this movie. She helps bring a majority of the comedy and nails it so well. At this point, I think everybody who reads my reviews knows that Ewan McGregor is one of my favourite actors and he still kills it as Roman in this movie. I will admit at certain times he does go a little bit over the top but for a majority of the time, he's a great villain. I will say that the beginning of the movie is slow because they have to introduce everybody but once it picks up the pace it picks it up fast. I have to applaud the set design people because the sets in this movie were outstanding. The last thing I want to mention is the score, composed by Daniel Pemberton, that I could see myself listening to and jamming out to. In the end, I got sucked into the story of Birds of Prey and this movie is definitely worth checking out. I give Birds of Prey a 8.5/10.",9.0,6 February 2020

How Harley Got Her Groove Back,"What started off poorly with Suicide Squad and evolved over the course of Aquaman and Shazam seems to have finally blossomed into the DCEU's new style of acid trip levels of color, fun action but a still lacking experience that somehow still feels like they're actively chasing Marvel.

Birds of Prey is basically the female DC version of Deadpool. Lots of narration, comedy violence and murder and a healthy dash of fourth wall breaking. It's slick, stylized and has some really cool action scenes here and there along with some legit laughs.

Robbie, Winstead and McGregor all seem to be having a blast too and I think that really shows at points. That's not to say the rest of the cast is bad, they're not, they just don't shine like those three.

Unfortunately, it doesn't feel like there was much attention paid to... Things making sense. It jumps around in time, personalities switch on a dime, we go from slapstick to brutality in an instant and there's a number of just random things that pop up, not even all McGuffins, that feel like someone just hitting a randomizer. Now, Harley narrates the whole thing and maybe this erratic style is meant to reflect her own personal brand of crazy but it does feel off at times.

There's also a supper not subtle message in here about female empowerment, which is great, that's an important topic, but could there be a single male in this world that isn't a terrible person? Not asking for a saint or savior here, just one dude that's not awful. I mean even Black Panther has Martin Freeman!

All in all, it's a fun watch. I wasn't checking the time in my seat, it wasn't as salacious as I thought it could be (that's a pro and further proof that women shoot women different than men). It's fun. It's trying to be more than that though and I don't think it gets there. Deadpool worked because it knew what it was and stuck with that, Birds of Prey wants to be more and I think it overreaches and that leaves it feeling a little hollow.",6.0,8 February 2020
A bad girl makes a great protagonist,"Shortly after Harley Quinn lets it be known, in explosive fashion, that she is no longer with The Joker everybody who has a grievance with her sets their sights on her. When she is captured by crime lord Roman Sionis she overhears a conversation about a missing diamond; she offers to get it back in exchange for her life. The diamond has been stolen by a young pick picket who swallowed it when arrested. In her search Harley will cross paths with both police and villains; some will prove to be allies and others a threat.

The main problem of films set in the world of superheroes is that the protagonists and almost always have near flawless personalities; this can make them a little boring. Harley Quinn is no heroine though; she will do what it takes to make sure she comes out on top; make deals with sadistic killers, betray trusts and change sides at the drop of a hat. This makes her interesting. The films basic plot isn't the most original but it serves to deliver plenty of entertaining action. Margot Robbie is great in the lead role; she brings a vibrant madness to the character without going too far. The supporting cast is solid and their characters are interesting even if not in the same league as Harley. The effects are pretty good. The film never takes itself too seriously and there are plenty of laughs to be had. Strong language and some violence mean this won't be suitable for younger fans of the genre. Overall I thought this was a lot of fun; I'd certainly recommend it to those jaded by more mainstream superhero fare.",7.0,11 July 2022

Spectacular and amazing as the characters are.,"I liked the movie because it was creative, the story was told in different ways. We start we comics. Harley acts as the narrator and tells us the story, sometimes going back. There are a few funny dialogs and scenes. We see a development of character as Harley is single now and must learn to be on her own. The Birds of Prey, Harley and Cass are a strong, diverse group of women. There is a lot of diversity in the whole movie. The fact that it was written and directed by women also made me curious. Margot Robbie as Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn is especially incredible if you consider that she's Australian playing a crazy psychiatrist with a thick American accent. Ewan McGregor was convincing as a bad guy, especially in one scene. Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress, Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary, Rosie Perez as Montoya, Chris Messina as Zsasz, Ella Jay Basco as Cass were also good. The music helped frame the shots as well. Go check out the movie yourself.",10.0,7 February 2020

Also it's nice how Male and Female characters get along nicely but in ultra feminist movies they have to have a butch, femboy males, and brain dead males. Not sure if I will rewatch. I took my son and his friends to this (would not have watched otherwise)...and this was the hardest pill for all 3 of us to swallow. Too caustic. Too many themes in your face.

Black Mask & Victor Zsasz (played by Ewan McGregor & Chris Messina as gay tinged psychopaths) take the lead in this front but a complication arises when a precious gem Messina was in the middle of transporting is lifted by a pickpocket, played by Ella Jay Basco, which prompts McGregor to assign Robie to get back (made even more complicated since Basco is now in police custody). What follows is a falling together of a ragtag outfit, which includes Rosie Perez's Detective Montoya, Jurnee Smollet-Bell's Black Canary & Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress to protect the wayward waif & survive the onslaught the Black Mask has in store for them. To parrot the duo from the Double Toasted youtube series, this film got right what the Suicide Squad got wrong. Anarchic, over the top, bloody & not a politically correct bone in its body, this film (which reminded me a lot of 1995's Tank Girl) wins the day w/its 'oh yeah, watch this!' ethos w/the singular Robie (for good or ill in a role which may be linked to for the rest of her days) commanding attention whenever she's on camera (which is a lot) w/the supporting players inking their spots to perfection.

occasionally fun when you get through the ridiculousness of it all,"Latest DCEU project is a snarky, self-deprecating showing with Harley Quinn as a neglected, anti-establishment child who grows up to be the brains and badass broad behind the Joker's crime spree, but after a devastating breakup with Puddin' she struggles to find herself. The little bit of plot there is jumps all over the place, and isn't especially engaging as Quinn gets caught up in a deadly cat-and-mouse game with an insidious kingpin, attempts to track down a MacGuffin, matches wits with a vocal vigilante, and crosses paths with a lethal huntress, all while eluding an ace detective. A colorful visual style, hip soundtrack, with unique fight scenes to grab your attention (there's even an amusing callback to The Terminator), and manic Robbie is all kinds of fun, but it becomes pretty bland once you get past all the initial shock value. Loud, slapdash, and gleefully uninhibited this is directed like a live-action cartoon that seems to be trying to take the Deadpool approach to the genre, but the finished product fails to fully translate. **",,1 April 2020
Nice build up to Harley Quinn & her gang,"This is a nice comic book movie with great action and humor. The story line and script was good and the fight sequences were enjoyable. Although some of the story line seem rushed and convenient, it is forgivable due to the time constraints.

Margot Robbie was top notch in this movie with great humor, narration, controlled madness and great action choreography delivery. It would have been easy to go over-the-top and over-act, but she did a really good job making the character likeable.

Although the movie is ultra-feminist and male-bashing, it fits the movie theme as it is like how Harley Quinn would see the world after being abused, abandoned and gone-mad by the chauvinistic and selfish Joker.

In terms of the action, it was really good, fluid and sleek. But I wished it more to John Wick's level of action cinematography, editing and sound effects, which would have made it perfect. Margot Robbie and Mary Elizabeth Winstead seems to express the action scenes well, but Jurnee Smollett-Bell actions fighting shots seem poorly framed, edited and choreographed which made it look amateurish. Not too sure whether she was not as prepared or not, but this should have been able to be compensated with camera and editing master craft.

In terms of the acting, all was well done, but when the ladies get together, there seem to a lack of chemistry or bonding, which made it feel a bit awkward. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was serious and less expressive while Rosie Perez, at times, looked out of place, probably due to lack of character development or poor transition from cop to vigilante. Ewan Mcgregor did not seem the most fitting for his role in this movie to me, but I might be biased (type-casting) by his previous movie/series roles I have watched.

Overall, I would recommended for you to watch it in the cinema now.",7.0,7 February 2020

I've read a couple of reviews prior and I thought this is going to be a trainwreck. Yes, the movie had plot points, and yes the movie had some corny moments, and of course the hot topic ""feminism"" - but hey, wake up - this is a comic book female super villain movie. It's not supposed to make you contemplate existence or think about the secrets of the universe. It's supposed to be fun. And that's just what it is. Suicide Squad was as well. People hating on these movies, but loving Wonder Woman - a movie that is basically a huge plot hole, a pathetic try of a ""feminist"" labeled superhero blockbuster.

Birds of Prey is what it is - nothing more, nothing less than a very fun movie to watch!

Margot absolutely killed it as Harley Quinn - with her mood swings, sexiness, craziness, deadliness and everything in between. Winstead also did her role justice, as she introduced the socially awkward assassin into the franchise. I'd like to put some focus on Smollet-Bell who was on fire the entire time she was on screen.

Taking crap from no one, Harley moves through Gotham trying to get over her break up from the Joker and the protection he offered. Now it's open season on Quinn and every lowlife is gonna try to take her down.

Margot Robbie is great as Harley Quinn and that is undeniable. The charisma and energy help drive the movie forward, but only so far. The plot is fairly low key, the bad guy doesn't like Quinn so orders her to be killed. He's also after a diamond that a girl has, who Quinn happens to get to first.

The film is very vibrant and kinetic, but with the lack of a strong plot feels an exercise in ""look how much fun Quinn is?"" Now if you are just a fan of the character then you are probably gonna love this. I enjoyed the film but I ultimately found it rather hollow.",7.0,17 February 2020
A huge disappointment,"After watching suicide squad one redeeming factor was harley Quinn. I had big Hope's for this film but it failed miserably, here's why.

Acting: I liked Margot robbie as harley Quinn. She did decent with what little she was given. Rosie Perez (the cop) did crap. I hate her in almost any role, she's such a bad actor. Her character was also terrible and under developed much the same with the other female cast members. I really like ewan mcgregor and he did have some funny/decent scenes in this. But again like the girls he was given little to work with and was severely under developed. It's hard to critic these actors performances when they were given such crap characterization.

Cinematography: Pretty decent shots and cgi. The fight scenes/coordination was random. Some fight scenes were really cool and brutal with bones being broken and environment destruction. But others were pathetic. The typical one vs one fight scenes whilst the 10 other goons just stand back and wait their turn is a joke. I know this is based from a comic book but that doesnt mean they have to have such a lame attempt at fight co ordination. They should take a page from sam hargrave.

Story: This plot seems like it was written in 10 mins whilst on the toilet. It was severely under developed, lacked any plot direction and characterization. However there was still some nice creative scenes. Like some fight scenes, explosions, and funny moments here and there. But most of the movie was so random and seemed to go from fight scene, music b roll scene, dialog scene, in random order. There was no real major meaning, villain or purpose to harley Quinn's journey and as a result of lacking characters and plot you get really damn bored by the end of this. The script seriously seems like it was given to a high schooler. The director, and writers should feel ashamed.

Summary: This isnt horrible because there is some decent and creative scenes. But the plot and characters were done terribly. So this is a 4/10 for me. I wouldnt recommend this, Watch deadpool instead.",4.0,30 May 2020
"Hate is the new trend it seems, I am a Batman fan and a huge Nolan Batman fan so take it from me, this movie is good","DC has been in the sewer since Nolan left and I don't care what anybody says, Aquaman is a DISGRACE in the name of a super hero movie - the DC casting is amazing but their movies are horrible. Having said that, I always thought that Suicide Squad was a fun movie and although I wouldn't compare it to any of the Marvel movies even though I'm not a fan of all of Marvel movies either... Suicide Squad was a pleasant surprise compared to the vomit they had been spitting out for years and as pleasant a surprise is the Birds Of Prey.

The movie has been accused of Extreme Feminism???? That the movie suggests men are bad, women are good propaganda?? You might be confusing this movie with the new Charlie's Angels movie. Just like the Joker can not be a woman, what did you want, the Birds of Prey gang to be men?? This movie had no feminist propaganda, I assure you of that.

I didn't like her costumes at all until the last few scenes. I really love the idea that in recent years production houses have been prepared to screen all the wild imaginations of the superhero universes, what a pure delight, but, alas, Birds of Prey is not quite as good as Gotham the tv series.

That's a generous 6/10,"Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn (2020) 6/10

That's a generous 6/10

The Blu-ray dropped today. I have total mixed views about the movie. It moves at a pace, which is good. The constant Harley narration grates after a while. Towards the end , which features less narration, the film is better for it. I liked the fine line between serious and cartoony the makers achieved. Blame it on the director, but there was something special about Margot Robbie in Suicide Squad, and that special is absent from Birds of Prey. As cartoony as the humour is, it fails to come close to the might of Deadpool. As you are probably aware, the recent Joker movie was deep. Birds of Prey is the complete opposite, and lacks any form of substance. There appears to be a big hole that runs through Birds of Prey. Deliberate or not, the fighting felt not too dissimilar to the 1960's Batman TV series, but without all the Kapow!

The Hyena was excellent. The CGI for the Hyena is 10/10

Ewan McGregor is ok. Admittedly i have never been a fan of his. The part he plays in BoP i felt would have suited a Leon era Gary Oldman so much better. I guess Gary is too old now, or is he?

I am sure I recall seeing the Joker during an early preview. That moment appears to be missing from the movie. Maybe I blinked and missed it? Admittedly I did fall asleep for about 5 minutes, which is never a good sign.

The theme song that plays a few times throughout the movie kept reminding me of the classic Supertramp track The Logical Song (the sort of music my dad listens to).",6.0,17 June 2020

"An Enjoyable, Albeit Messy, Waltz Through Gotham","If watching Marvel movies is the equivalent of going to an amusement park, then watching the first entries into the DC universe (""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice"", ""Suicide Squad"") is the equivalent of watching an incredibly drunk person try to do gymnastics. It's still somewhat amusing, but it's certainly nothing special.

""Birds of Prey"" started off rambling incoherently, just like the majority of DCU movies. The first forty-five minutes are essentially the film boasting about how crazy it is without ever really showing us that craziness. Continuing my metaphor: it's like a drunken cheerleader telling us she's going to do a triple backflip, but she never lines up to do it. Then, finally, after forty-five minutes of boasting about its (her) skills, the film (our drunken cheerleader) actually takes a few steps forward, lining up to do its (her) trick, and though it (she) stumbles in the first few steps and looks awkward when it (she) finally leaps into the air, the film (she) does that triple backflip, and lands, just barely, standing.

While what you would have witnessed wouldn't have been pretty, I'd bet you'd still be surprised that inebriated person was left standing at the end of the trick, and that's exactly how I felt at the end of this movie. There were so many bad moments, so many mediocre moments, so many downright annoying moments, that even I am surprised I gave this film a passing grade. Still, I guess it's not that bad. It's just not that great either.",6.0,7 February 2020

Im glad they decided to.lean into Harley Quinn a bit more and Margot robbies performance of her brings most of the value much like Ryan reynolds performance of deadpool brings value to those films. Even though it has an all female main cast, it doesnt hamfist the ""girl power"" angle while still being able to be interpreted as feminist which is something many films have difficulty doing (captain marvel to name one that failed at this.) The majority of the story until the final act is far more show than tell than many previous dc films. There are set pieces and ideas in this movie that work fairly well. The club scene early in the movie, the two car chase scenes, the jailbreak scene, Harley blissfully or chaotically evading capture from multiple characters to name a few. These concepts play to the strengths of these characters for the most part. The characters: mostly fine. Harley and black canary work really well together and the detectives interactions with Harley for the majority of the movie work.and are entertaining. Hundreds however was very underutilized, she didnt even make contact with the core group of characters until the final act and they used half of her short time interacting with the core characters spouting exposition and backstory. They didnt do a good job setting up her role in the story. Thematically, this film feels like it doesnt really know what its trying to be and at times feels like it was directed by 3 different people. It feels like one person wrote a handful of very well crafted scenes and someone else was left to write what was in between. There are other problems that i havent explained but these were the main issues i have with the story. That being said it isnt a bad movie.

"We have a while to go, but this is an extremely entertaining step in the right direction","After watching the movie and reviewing the reviews, I would argue that the average is a bit too low in my eyes. I think to properly review the movie, you must take into consideration your own personal biases as well as make yourself knowledgeable on the facts of the film. It's pretty obvious: this is a movie created by women for women, and I fall into that target category. I am also a lover of Harley Quinn. To me, this movie lived up to what I though it would. I think it's a pretty good Harley Quinn movie, and definitely surpasses some of her past iterations. Something that stuck out to me especially was the approach to costumes in the movie. Harley Quinn is eccentric, and they really ran with it. Some of the reviewers complained about them looking like a crazed fashion designer was let loose, but I think that's the point? Especially compared to Margot Robbie's costumes in Suicide Squad, these are absolutely miles better. Also, pertaining to Suicide Squad, the depiction of how women actually look and act in relation to their clothes and makeup in this movie I thought was spectacular. Ponytails aren't in perfectly coiled tresses automatically. It just seems so Hollywood when it's like that. Harley Quinn seems more like a real person who behaves like a person in this. (Of course she's still absolutely unhinged; she wouldn't be Harley without it!) Another thing I noticed was people complaining about hyper-feminism and the theme being ""men are bad."" I think that the latter is completely false. To me, the them was more along the lines of, ""You are your own person. You don't need to rely on someone to hold you up, and you shouldn't."" In this movie, yes, it was referring to the male presences in Harley Quinn's life (and all the characters' lives), but that's because so many women can relate to that. We've been told it should be like that for thousands of years, ever since we acquired goods to defend c. 12,000 years ago. This is where I think personal bias comes in. Being raised male or female has a serious impact on both how you're treated and how you perceive the world. This is not to say the movie had faults. While it was still enjoyable, it did seem to be a slightly worse homage to Deadpool's style of narrating. Personally, though, I still enjoyed it, but I understand where people are coming from. Also, the middle was a little lacking, and some of the dialogue was a bit.... eh. it didn't distract me too much, and I'm a playwright, but, again, that's just my experience. Lastly, I would like to commend the ending. I think it was very Harley Quinn, and I was rather overjoyed to both see a funhouse set (props to the actors and stunt-people for working there; as an amateur fight choreographer, I can tell how much work went into that scene) and Harley on rollerskates. Rollerskating and roller derby especially are a big thing for women, so it's really cool to see it on the ""big screen."" (Also, it's very Harley and I'm glad they incorporated it!) To conclude, if you are a woman, I think you'll likely enjoy this movie. It's funny and entertaining. It's a fun watch. I can't say ""if you're a man, the opposite will be true,"" because I am not a man, so how would I know? But I think it offers a good glimpse into women in Hollywood, and I think this is a step in the right direction in terms of female empowerment and feminism in film.",8.0,20 September 2020
Highly entertaining yet messy,"This film works for several reasons, mainly due to the performance of Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. She was the right choice and we saw it from the original Suicide Squad film (2016). The colors and overall visuals make the film stand out.

The plot of the film is quite messy but there is a certain entertainment factor. A lot of different and unique characters of the Birds of Prey. Wean McGregor as the villain wasn't great, the character felt rather forced and it seemed more so as he was doing a Joker impression. He was severely miscast.

The narration by Quinn is also a good touch. Although the film starts off relatively slow, it gets a lot more engaging about halfway through.",7.0,18 August 2022
Lucky that all the preposterous coincidences happened,"The first half is boring and the second half is almost as boring. It's staggering a film can have to little happen to further the story with is finish in the extreme anyway.

Yes, it tells a story through Harley's eyes but if that's the only positive then clearly it's not a good film.

I ignored the reviews and gave it a chance but an average of 6/10 is generous.

The film has no imaginative storyline whatsoever and can be summed up by one thing that happens in the second half - you'll know it when it happens - because nothing is mentioned about it but it completely changes everything.",2.0,7 August 2022

A Margot Robbie One Woman Show,,8.0,15 May 2023
"Harley Quinn shines, Black MaskGregor does not","Birds of Prey is a nice superhero film, and could be better if it kept the same level throughout it. Margot Robbie does once more (and now with more time) a great job giving life to cartoon character Harley Quinn. Her partners are not so shining but are OK. Art direction and colorful palette work most of the time (not very well in the middle of the motion picture, asI will mention below). The opening animated scene is very good. The jokes are mostly funny and above average in recent superhero movies (DC or Marvel, no difference at all). The end and the gore scenes were also good. A major problem are the too long, repetitive and visually amateur fight against the False Face Society in the amusement park (there was a glimpse of 60's Batman onomatopoeian fights, but much less charming) and most of action scenes in the third and fourth quintiles of the film. Villains Roman Sionis and Victor Zsasz were also uncharismatic, generic and undevelopped. Off course it is partially a drawback caused in the script, but I cannot avoid but say that Ewan McGregor's performance here was uninspired and disappointing. Anyway, although irregular and not fanatstic, Birds of Prey is still one of the good ones aming the numerous supehero flicks that have been made.",7.0,5 February 2021
Worse than many B movies,"I assume producer/star Margot Robbie paid herself her usual A-list salary then went ahead and hired the cheapest director, writer, stunt team and co-stars (except Ewan McGregor) she could find. The result is this undeniable mess.

Stop seeing Politics where there aren't Any,"People seem to think the theme of this movie is that men are bad and women are awesome. I understand there are many movies that do political crap messages but this is definitely not one of them. Are there bad guys who are men? Yes. So? Is this movie anywhere near as good as Joker? Of course not. Is this your standard so so DC movie? YES. Sorry if you're DC fan but DC films are by definition inferior to Marvel. Having said that I'll sum it up: The action's awesome, it's filmed well, and I always liked the idea of protecting a child being the goal of protagonists which was the case here. Yes it is a bit corny and very Deadpoolish and yes the antagonist is for crap. You can have a cheesy protagonist and have a serious and scary antagonist (I.E Shredder from the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). Not sure why they decided to make Ewan McGregor's character so ridiculous. The mask he wore was pretty daunting. Deciding to make his character so flamboyant and cowardly was a dumb decision. That being said it was better than suicide Squad. Even tho it basically was Suicide squad minus their lame Jared Leto cardboard cutout version of the Joker.",7.0,15 February 2020
"A super fun, albeit flawed, ride","The villain, though I usually love Ewan McGregor, was really weak and the storytelling was choppy. But Birds of Prey is so fun and camp with lots of funny quips, fun costumes, and gorgeous action sequences that I see it having definite midnight movie potential. Cathy Yan took a big swing with her ultra-stylized direction style and, though it falters in places, it is a real breath of fresh air in a genre that can sometimes seem a little too color-by-numbers and focus-grouped. Plenty of memorable scenes and set pieces that show you a lot of love and care was put into making this movie, and the performances by the main cast-particularly Robbie-were excellent.",6.0,27 February 2020
"Harley Quinn was okay, the rest of it was not up to par","The girl who played Harley Quinn put her heart into the movie and you can tell she did. But from that point, it went downhill. The Huntress is one of the sexiest characters in the DC universe and they flopped badly on this character. Black Canary is supposed to be a classic blond white chick and they caved in to PC non-sense on that character and wasted so many opportunities just for the sake of clueless PC mentality. The guy who played the Black Mask was good in his role. But what is going on that white men are now the bad guys at every opportunity in superhero and science fiction movies?? There is some bigotry and shortsightedness there. Overall, if you have not seen the movie it is a good watch. Fun to watch and fast paced, you won't get bored.

More annoying that entertaining.,"I'll keep this short because this film has dappled all my energy.

This is a frantic mess of a film. The story is ludicrous and small and just involving. Most of the many characters are thoroughly annoying - and I include Robbie as Quinn whose face pulling just irritates - and the result of that is that you don't really care what happens to any of them.

The fight sequences are silly and poorly stages. I think they are supposed to amuse but the stupidity of having one crazy unarmed woman fight off several large men with guns is just stupid. The slow-mo sections don't help.

I had been told that this was much better than Suicide Squad and as that is THE worst film ever made I presumed it would be.

Preachy Movie,"Not to be to political but this is what happens when hen you put politics ahead of talent and entertainment. I really liked Margot Robbie in Suicide Squad as the mentally unwell harlequin, the writer was really good and the effects too. But they just loaded this with politics and feminism. Not to say I don't believe women are strong but stop making dumb movies like this I watched Barbie before watching this and I thought Barbie was too political, then I watched this and honestly they're tied. I love the women DC characters but they can't keep digging this hole I love DC and it makes me sad to see this being done to all the franchises nowadays.

"Terrible title, movie is a fun watch.","Not knowing what to expect, I was more or less a blank canvas going into this movie. By the end, I had enjoyed myself and while it was a little too much on the 'women good - men bad' train that seems to be going around these days, it was tolerable. My biggest gripe with the film was even bothering to include Birds of Prey in the title, the movie should simply have been called the Emancipation of Harley Quinn. The phrase 'Birds of Prey' only comes into it at the very end of the movie and even then it is nothing more than a throw away line, not even enough to set up a stand-alone Birds of Prey movie, not that I could see much of a demand for one.

But the movie is fun, a great afternoon filler at matinée or cheapie Tuesday prices. It's difficult to shake the feeling that so much more could have been done here with the concept and this was a wasted opportunity.",7.0,7 March 2020
Action is boring without the right elements to enhance the setting,"What worked: It's a light hearted, fun entertaining movie with some light humor and action sequences.

The movie got some action sequences, funny scenes and decent climax. So, for that regard, the movie is engaging and enjoyable. What did not work: Of course, the movie lacks a good screenplay, direction and character development. The narrative is all over the place, even when accepting the fact that the movie follows non linear narrative. The story is predictable, a very simple concept.

not for men,"It's REALLY not surprising to me that everyone giving this a poor rating is a man. it makes sense because this movie wasn't made for men. it's a classic DC antihero thriller, but the twist is that the target audience is young women. everything from the details like how she paints her guns or the graffiti on the street, the costumes and makeup and jewelry, the jokes, the different fighting styles of each character, the colors used to light the scenes, even the soundtrack: it's all by women, for women. think of a romcom of a woman post breakup, add in a little gore and choreographed fighting scenes, have her ""find herself"" by killing a TON OF MEN, and you have this movie. it's definitely not for everyone, and i can see why it's getting a couple of the negative reviews (like how she is suddenly not very crazy anymore but instead very coherent and driven), but imagine if Iron Man had a target audience of 24 year old women. y'all probably wouldn't have liked that as much either.",10.0,14 September 2020
Mixed bag!,"I honestly lean more towards the positive side, at many moments I had fun and I was completely surprised. I don't know why, but from the trailers it looked awful, much worse than it really is. But, despite everything, it is a rather mediocre film with a bad agenda, which makes it at times fake and unreal. The other thing is that this is absolutely a Harley Quinn movie, as many people feared. In general, the other characters are there, just enough to mix up a mess and not be empty. I've never been interested in Birds of Brey comics, but even I know Harley Quinn was never present. Anyway, the problem with the film is that it starts out quite fascinating, no matter how simple the story is and to be honest until the last third, I was surprisingly satisfied. But the closer we got to the end, the more ridiculous and unconvincing things became. For example the terrible contrast between some action scenes plays a role, because they invited the director of John Wick to re-shoot some of them, because they were obviously quite bad. Therefore, there is a great contrast to how some fight scenes are great and original, and others are downright pittyful, especially when little women beat men at 2 meters, 120 kg.

The film goes downhill exactly where it shouldn't - when their team gathers. Somehow, when I watched the stories of the chicks intertwine, it was much more interesting, but when they got together, something really didn't work. And the nonsense they started talking and doing, at times approached dangerously Cartoonish levels. Also I didn't like that men are portrayed as misogynists, scoundrels, idiots and some primitive beasts. This was very annoying.

However, I managed to have fun in the first half, it was not bad. I also recognize the good roles of much of the cast, most impressed by Margo Robbie, who is as fantastic as Harley and Ewan McGregor, who definitely had fun in the role of the Black Mask and at times was a very pleasantly exaggerated character.",6.0,8 June 2021

Flawed But Better Than Expected,"It's an R-rated superhero comedy that seems like it's trying to be a female version of Deadpool. As the cutesy overlong title suggests, it's trying a bit too hard. Thankfully a vaguely self-depricating tone and kinetic direction in the action scenes make up for a lot of the script's goofier excesses.

This movie was divisively marketed, and although there's some pandering it's less egregious than the pre-release controversy indicated. In fact any pretensions to profundity - whether related to gender politics, childhood trauma or anything else - are about as deep as a puddle and so don't come across nearly as preachy as the marketing suggested.

This is actually a Harley Quinn solo feature - the Birds of Prey are an underdeveloped afterthought. Roman Sionous and Victor Zsasz are two of the lamest and most inept villains ever filmed.

Just watch for the action scenes,"So what once was a Bird of Prey centered title for the film, after a certain rebranding by WB today, the title suggests that this is a Harley Quinn centered film rather than a team up which is indeed rightfully so. This movie completely centers around Harley Quinn and the team up is left until the final huge fight scene in the movie. So, basically the movie is about Black Mask trying to obtain a diamond from a child whom stole it from him and Harley Quinn becoming a lone wolf rather than having to rely on the Joker and that's about it.

First off, I must praise the main actress, Margot Robbie I think she is amazing as Harley Quinn which indeed is true as the best part of Suicide Squad was her performance. I'm here to say that she brings the psycho to the table and delivers a really good performance here. Other than that, Ewan Mcgregor's performance was fun for the most part of the film but I feel that his performance was let down by the writing department whom failed to really bring his character to life as his character is so one-dimensional and in the end he's just a douchebag without any real reason.

And of course, the best part of the movie, the fight scenes whereby they had the John Wick team to assist them with the fight choreography and it does absolutely show in the movie. The police heist vent that takes place within the movie is absolutely spectacular and just all around gorgeous to look at. It is literally bursting with colour which brings about quite a spectacle when you think about bringing a gymnastic sort of character to a fight scene with vibrant colours.

The problem I have with this movie is that the plot is nothing too amazing, but, the movie is plot driven and that's a problem right there. The side characters, well, I've never read the comics or what not but basically the others excluding Harley herself don't really have enough character building for you to really feel or like them. The pacing of the movie is also another issue I had with it whereby the movie tried to formulate the Deadpool-isc time jump that they had going on in the first movie and it didn't really go out that well as the time jumps are at often used to introduce a side character's backstory or well it takes you from a cool scene in which the case would be the bank heist scene whereby they just stopped the momentum of the scene and cut back to a time before, which is yet another issue I had because the best part of the movie is indeed the fight scenes.

All in all, this is an enjoyable film and well, I went into this movie with no expectations whatsoever so, I didn't experience the joyful disappointment of Justice League. But yes, this movie has a few issues with it but hey, props to those intending to do something wacky, but just seriously, at the same time do think of the movie's pacing, that's really important.",6.0,11 February 2020

Robbie gets her sandwich.,"How can you not get some enjoyment from Birds Of Prey? Some reviews are pretty poor so I decided to offset at least one. One reviewer wrote that there is no depth. For goodness sake, it's a comic book movie. So, in essence, it's a non-sensicle, loud, brash, colourful, action packed explosion of entertainment. It's very feminist, all the girls are super heroes who easily despatch huge muscular guys. Just like in real life, eh, girls? Oh, well, let them have their fantasies I guess. Nevertheless, I found it very entertaining although slightly long. Like most movies today it could have been tighter, less fighting and a bit more subtle in places would have got it higher marks from me. All the same, it's very funny in places and in contrast, rather violent, but always entertaining, mainly thanks to the charismatic Margot Robbie who really revels in this role. It may even be the role that ultimately defines her, even though she has given superior acting performances such as I Tonya. Ewan McGregor is the villain who likes to cut off the faces of his victims, which is rather gross for a comic book movie so be warned. Rosie Perez is the cop in charge determined to stop Harley in her naughty tracks. Great fun.",7.0,11 July 2022

"I liked it but didn't love it or hate it, but I thought it was one of those films it's fun to watch but it's time waster.","When I saw trailer when it first come out, I saw it I said eh nothing special it didn't excite me just like with suicide squad, but with suicide squad I liked it better then this for some reason. Fun fact I loved how it's R RATED, so because Joker (2019) film got success with R RATED film that's why DC said eh screw this let's make this into R RATED I am totally fine with that I love things when it's R RATED I remember saying to myself why could of Suicide Squad (2016) could have been R RATED just like

with this film. This all film does continue story from ending of Suicide Squad, it doesn't show joker Jared Leto in film as well it's some else dressed like him but it's not Jared, so story follows Harley broke out prison like ending of suicide squad the joker got here out of there, in the another hand joker kicked her out because joker didn't want her anymore so now on she is alone she ends up getting drunk smashed, eating tons of junk food so she does nothing in film until she went to club met Black Mask/ Roman (Ewan McGregor) until she met few characters in film Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) She is cop, Helena Bertinelli / The Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) I thought I loved her character out of Harley Quinn all among others I thought she was more of interesting character her family got gunned down by gangsters she survived it then she become the Huntress with crossbow killing everyone like a vigilante I loved her character much more to be honest. Dinah Lance / Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) another girl who works for Black Mask she has superpowers as well I wished she could used it earlier ago, but she doesn't she uses it until at very end of film. I got feeling that this film is a wannabe this movie is trying to be a female Deadpool movie. Because in Deadpool 2 when Wade makes a team out of himself and has to save kid the boy just like in this film with little Chinese girl Cassandra (Ella Jay Basco) who lives in her foster parents she has a broken arm she prick pockets from people she gets in danger because she steals a Diamond from Roman Henchmen and Roman made a contract worth a lot of money to catch Cassandra because she has diamond that is totally worth about millions of dollars, Harley has to product her, just like in Deadpool 2 when Wade Wilson makes a new team and save and product kid. Also, their thing in movie like here's my story but then keeps going back and forth until we get back to scene like in first Deadpool which was annoying. In the comic's Black mask is a hardcore mobster who kills with a black mask I thought Black Mask looked a lot scarier in comic books and in cartoons but in this movie in the movie Black Mask was turned gay an cartoony to fit the tone I thought it worked for what the film was a dumb silly cartoon, witch made him not enjoyable or like villain you will like but I think they should made him scarier, series, dark character he keeps having mask on the mask didn't even looked scarier he didn't wear mask until at very end of movie what the heck is this? That's my issue with film if he wears mask entire film it would been sick but no made him like a cartoon when it's a movie made him like gay cartoon tone villain that's what it is he is a wimp in this movie that's one thing it put me out of movie. Didn't make Black mask scarier, a lot evil, badass type but wear mask in entire film as mystery as in we don't know what he looks like just like with Dredd (2012) where it's Karl Urban but he doesn't take off helmet off entire film witch that should have happened, Black Mask doesn't take out mask entire him make mask more scarier make villain more scarier, evil, badass type of guy not wimp gay cartoonish. I thought this film was Entertaining at times, fun to watch wasn't boring at all the film doesn't slow down at all, Ewan

McGregor's performances weren't as great as what they were with the nice compliments he looks like he is having fun with his role but in same time I reckon I seen him in better movies as in better performance, but in this his wimpy villain that's what I don't like. And another thing it's trying to be a gender female version of bent version of Deadpool 2 that's not a issue with me but the story is trying to be Deadpool 2, I hate people arguing about For being R-rated, the violence feels neutered well look at Deadpool films, Marvel Netflix shows, Joker (2019) film that got R RATED but got a very successfully Ratings well great but doesn't mean this movie flopped and people arguing R RATED doesn't mean that's biggest issue about movie. She restrains from letting anyone steals her spotlight. If her and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker are caught together in a love story, it will be the best romance movie of the decade. The complexity and different types of deranged personalities they uphold. Wow!

Final battle, the best thing is the lack of unrealistic weaponry that they occupy which makes it all feels so real. It is entertaining and fun too as there are certain scenes that feature a low amount of quick cuts, I liked final Battle but I thought it could done a lot better I seen better in Zombieland (2009) at circus, but in this it's fun but it's too much quick cuts in action scenes, funny enough the Adds 'John Wick' Stunt and Fight Coordinators in this movie as well. I remember one tiny cameo Sionis' Chauffeur (Daniel Bernhardt) known for Bloodsport 2-4, Matrix Reloaded, John Wick, Atomic Blonde, Kill'em All, Logan, Escape Plan: The Extractors I remember him in a lot of cameo's I seen in movies with him in it he has a tiny cameo role in this movie. I thought this was good fun to watch but not brilliant oh me saying I loved it I thought it's one of those type of movies I would watch it again but not dozens of times oh me saying I loved me to death but it's pretty good enjoyable but give it around 6.10 I am trying to love it hardest as I can I am trying to but theirs few issues with film like with quickly cuts action scenes, I thought villain was meant to be in comic

books Black Mask to be evil, dark, series, scary type of looking villain but it turns out to be wimpy, dope gay cartoon villain the script writers made huge mess on that one, I thought Asian girl Cassandra was boring as character nothing in here just block of wood even the Asian girl in film Safe (2012) was a lot better in this movie, it's a wannabe Deadpool 2 with females no issues with that but I wish this film could been itself make it like Deadpool 2 but itself don't make it same but writers did it is because they have nothing else better to write in their scripts look if you like Most people thought this was Suicide Squad 2, but it's not because Suicide Squad 2 is out next year is called The Suicide Squad title of film that's next chapter, I liked this birds of prey but not greatest, not brilliant but I thought it's fun to watch as time waster that's all it is in my opinion.",7.0,18 February 2020

Through Harley's perspective a birds of prey origin movie🌟,"Why so much hate? It's Harley Quinn for God's sake.. What were you all thinking guys? Another joker movie where Harley Quinn is just going to be his side kick? Harley Quinn character has got so much potential than just being someone's sidekick.Also if there was Batman, we wouldn't have got to see Gotham City like this, we wouldn't have had this much fun cause again Batman is a super hero whom we all have seen and known for so many years. This is a group independent strong female gang. I really never had this much fun watching a film although I am a film addict and I go to the theaters often.This film basically tells us to quit a toxic relationship with a toxic person. It also has a very catchy sandtrack. I would definitely recommend this film to everyone. Just leave it to Harley, relax and get crazy with her.",10.0,9 February 2020

"I never read the comics, so I review this as a stand-alone movie.","I think the main issue with this movie is the script. It's all over the place, it kind of makes sense when you realize it's being told from Harley's perspective but that doesn't make it good.

The action sequences felt a bit too clean and choreographed for my taste, it's like watching a ballet performance.

I never felt any connection with the characters. And I never had the feeling they were in any real danger.

Although I'm no expert on editing, there was one scene that I think goofed up a little. I'm not sure if that was the editor's fault, the director's or simply because of budgetary reasons but it screwed up the flow of the scene to the extent that I feel like including it in my review.

Then there was a scene where Black Canary showed some true super power level stuff but it felt extremely out of place with the rest of the film. In the cut that I saw it was never explained either, it just came out of nowhere.

I personally didn't like the art style, but other reviewers claimed they liked it so that must just be me then.

Other reviewers have also stated that this R rated movie seems more targeted at young teenage girls, and I completely agree. The rating seems out of place with the target audience. Comparing this to a female version of Deadpool kind of makes sense, however it's not nearly as funny. This movie might get a single chuckle out of you, maybe.

This Is Not The Harley Quinn I Was Looking For.,"Greetings And Salutations, and welcome to my review of Birds Of Prey; here's the breakdown of my ratings:

Story: 1.00 Direction: 1.50 Pace: 1.25 Acting: 1.00 Enjoyment: 1.00

TOTAL: 5.75 out of 10.00

So, how great should Birds Of Prey have been? It should have been EPIC. But, once again, DC fail amazingly. What is worse, however, is the female-heavy cast and crew. You would have thought that due to the recent revealing of the Hollywoodland Boys Club perversions and perverts, the ladies would have something to prove. I was understandably excited - an all-female cast of DC's strong female characters, written and directed by women. This story is going to be good. At the very least, they'll add that female element that most men miss. How wrong I was, and how disappointed.

Basically, the story that Christina Hodson gives the audience is that of a Joker-dumped Harley Quinn trying to find herself and make her own way in the seedy underworld of Gotham. While doing that, she interweaves some lesser tales of the Birds fluttering around the ganglands. Dinah Lance, the daughter of Black Canary, warbles at the nightclub of Roman Sionis (Black Mask). Helena Bertinelli, a mafia boss' daughter, now wears the mantle of The Huntress. And Renee Montoya, an ex-GCPD officer who's still tracking down the villains and seeking justice. This synopsis should have been enough, but sadly, Hodson fails to build any credible characters. In truth, she even harms Harley's fundamental persona. This Harley is drab and unfunny. There are one or two places where Dini and Timm's Harley breaks through, though it's in too few scenes to make a difference. This Harley isn't even the Harley of the Suicide Squad. The irreverence, insanity, insolence, and mirthfulness are toned down too much, which takes out most of the darker humour. And, in truth, Hodson has trouble writing comedy. And another drawback to the humourless Harley is that Hodson also attempts to make The Huntress a comedic figure. DC needed to hire another writer onto the crew. A female comedian who could get Harley's acerbic wit and comebacks down pat and think outside the sanity box when it comes to revenge and beat downs. The story needed stronger characterisations to keep the viewers entertained.

Cathy Yan does an admirable job with the direction. She opts for a Comic Book style which is refreshing in the DC Universe - which has decided on a more gritty and dramatic approach, which doesn't work. The explosion at the Ace Chemical Factory is glorious. It's bright, colourful, and fun... but not as much fun as it should have been. I found that Yan, though a good director, isn't too skilled when it comes to humour. Her timing is slightly off, and she misses many opportunities to use her filmmaking talents to add extra comedic elements to the screen, particularly around Harley Quinn. But that said, it's still a well-shot picture.

Sadly, the cast isn't great. The worst of the bunch is Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis. For some reason, he's dropped the ultra coolness of the character to add his own over-the-top insanity. It's as though he's trying out for the Joker role in the next flick - very strange. Even worse still is that McGregor is horrendous. If this had been the first performance in his acting career, we may have never heard from him again. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is poorly miscast as Helena Bertinelli. She doesn't possess the aura or attitude of a Huntress. And then we get to Margot Robbie. I couldn't help but get the feeling that she was weary of Harley Quinn - and that hurt the movie the worst of all. It's terrible when your leading lady looks bored with a character she had previously made her own. But it could simply be the actors and actresses doing as directed, and giving the audience the personalities as they were written. If that is the case, then shame on the writer and director.

Birds Of Prey is not the worst DC live-action movie, though it isn't the best either. If you've been keeping up with the DC universe, then feel free to watch this picture. It should entertain you, though not as much as it should have. Otherwise, I would suggest staying with the DC Animation films as they attempt to keep the true DC characters, though the stories may be bastardised a tad. Or you can switch over to the far superior Marvel universe, which is more entertaining and enjoyable - and this coming from a Die-Hard DC fan.

No thank you.,Not a fan of this movie.

The movie is over the top and not in the good way. Plays to alot of troupes. Ignores the characters truly remarkable past and the update to her looks makes her trashier then ever. I'd say its sad when the animated series is better then this movie but that's the way it seems to be d.c.

Watch this Film with your whole attention...,"...And you will see that the low rating of many people was not fair.

I will tell you why. Because sometimes it's like a lot of viewers are more focused on eating as much popcorn as possible while watching the movie. I can see this is happening so many times and some good scenes are ignored. And especially in this movie they where a lot of good scenes. The dialogue was also from the finest. I can't give an example i would spoil some brilliant scenes. And the varieties of emotions from Margot Robbie was worthy of Oscar. Before I saw this film I thought this would be a boring film, I was totally wrong. What i also liked was the Editing if you watch some punching or kicking scenes it was this slow motion editing in the Style of Wonder Women film.

So it is your decision to whatch it or not. Margot Robbie is an Actress with Extra Ordinary Skills and she is gifted with something you can't learn.

The fact that it's not really a Birds of Prey movie could be the first red flag.,"It's a particularly fitting side project for Robbie, who is working on the first big-screen adaptation of DC's all-female superhero team. Because Cathy Yan's film Birds Of Prey has elements of the irreverent and rockabilly spirit of QT's 1994 classic, in addition to having the DNA of a lady gang who can smash your sorry ass.

A brief animated synopsis of Suicide Squad's events reveals that Robbie's Harley Quinn and the Joker have broken up. She publicly updates her relationship status by driving a truck into Ace Chemicals, the plant where she publicly confessed her love to the clown prince of crime. The film then frenziesly depicts Robbie's attempts to deal with life on her own, including roller derbying, buying a hyena she names Bruce, and having her partying antics captured in a single, extended shot that looks like a coked-up 1917. The movie poses the query, ""Who is Harley without Mr. J."" A motley crew of various women hold the key to the solution.

Expect things to settle eventually, but for now it's a wonderful, fidgety, breathless start. Since Harley Quinn is the movie's narrator, everything makes sense given her damaged mental state. Following in the footsteps of her lead character, screenwriter Christina Hodson breaks up the story by revealing key plot points gradually and presenting us to the main characters: Renee Montoya, a detective belittled in her work and addicted to the language and clichés of '80s police dramas, is looking into a hit by the crossbow-wielding assassin Huntress; Dinah Lance, a singer known by the stage name Black Canary and gifted with a powerful voice, warbles in the nightclub of Gotham crime lord Roman Sionis; and lastly, there's Cassandra Cain.

Though it was made in the #MeToo and #TimesUp era, the movie doesn't overtly convey its messages. All these women are doing is helping each other out and getting things done. It feels like a mistake not to get the group together sooner and more frequently because it's so much fun when they do get together. Although none of the characters are very well-drawn, Harley is an exception: Smollett-Bell has a true toughness, Winstead plays a humorous assassin who becomes enraged when people mispronounce her superhero name, and Perez serves as a reminder that she does not appear in nearly enough films. The real star, though, is Robbie, who gives Harley a lovable eccentricity and credible threat while subtly revealing details about her personal life without resorting to long monologues.",6.0,19 February 2024

Drinking and swearing her way through a confusing and grotesque world, and worse meandering script, that did little to raise the character into the realm of interesting.

Is she super well-connected that she got this role that she did not deserve?

"I gave Birds of Prey a chance, and:","Margot Robbie carries ""Birds of Prey"" as the beloved, psychotic wonder that is Harley Quinn, showing a colorful and charismatic display of ultra-violence against the masses of scumbag men (A performance very reminiscent of Ryan Reynolds and his embodiment of Deadpool).

Aside from the theatrical menace of Ewan Macgregor's Black Mask, the side characters, especially the ""birdies"", lack identity and flourishment from source materials, and thus their impact suffers, which, in my opinion, is a bi-product of predictable, conventionally-unconvencial storytelling and a slow mid-point in order to create substance.

If watching a bizarre journey of the fan-favorite criminal clown-lady as she break the bones of fiendish men responsible for rape culture is up your alley, I'd say it's worth your admission. It's a big step-up from 2016's insufferable mess that is Suicide Squad.",7.0,11 February 2020

"Good acting and action, terrible screenplay","Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is the eighth film in the DCEU and probably contender for one of the longest titles ever for a film. Despite the film being called Birds of Prey, which was a team comprise of women superheroes,this film is really a Harley Quinn movie. The movie is even narrated and told in the perspective of Harley Quinn. They probably should've called the movie Harley Quinn and friends. I loved Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad despite how garbage that movie was so it is great to see her star in her own film.

One of the things I loved about this movie was the fact that it gave a relatively realistic portrayal of Harley Quinn dealing with the breakup with Joker. She didn't just move on straight away, she swallowed herself in sadness and anger before accepting her new self. I also have to praise the rest of the cast and characters as well. Jurnee Smollett-Bell shines as Black Canary by giving a bad women character and Mary Elizabeth Winstead for giving a ferocious performance as Huntress. It is a real shame however, that for a film called Birds of Prey, we don't actually to get see much of the ""Birds of Prey"". Ewan Mcgregor gives a great performance as Black Mask despite how poorly written the character is. There is honestly nothing about Black Mask, he is just a typical villain with no depth to himself whatever or even genuine motivation or backstory. He wants power and diamonds and that is all there is to him. On the other hand, despite the small screentime Chris Messina is able to give a fair amount of character towards the secondary villain Victor Zsasz. This is based on a source material so I have to give a nod to the fact that the character of Cassandra Cain played by Ella Jay Basco is butchered and kind of pathetic. Movies of course don't have to be the same as the source material and the change to the character was necessary for Harley Quinn and the story they were telling. However, there is no really stand out moments from Cassandra Cain with the only memorable thing was stealing and getting saved all the time. A shame really.

Despite the relatively lower budget of this film compared to typical superhero movies, the action scenes are phenomenal and well choreographed. Additionally, the soundtrack is unique and adds towards the movie. The movie also has a great visual style with colourful sets and storytelling with a chaotic order that adds to Harley's character. Still, the screenplay is not great honestly. Some of the dialogue are quite cheesy,generic or lacking in genuine banter between the characters. By the end of the film, I didn't really feel like the bond between these characters were earned or should even exist. I also think it should be noted that this is a feminist film and it really shows. For example, there is not even remotely one good male character in this entire film. It really pushes the women power message straight in your face which could have been done a little better.

Nevertheless, despite the flaws, this movie continues to be a step in the right direction for the DCEU and I hope Warner Bros continues to maintain and exceed this quality of superhero movies. To anyone reading this, I recommend giving this movie a watch because even if there are some issues with the movie, you will still come out feeling that you had a good time.",7.0,8 February 2020
Not bad but not good,"Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is excellent. She's got some wicked fight scenes and plays the role perfectly. Other than that, the movie is bad. It feels like it is trying to be deadpool. The story is weak, Black Mask is disappointing, Zaz is super lame, and Black Canary couldn't decide what she wanted to be. My wife and I could not stand the kid. Huntress, not bad. Would've liked more of her. This is about on par with the other DC movies. Wants to be a comic book movie but doesn't fully embrace the comic book characters (except Harley). Hope to see Harley in a better movie.

The diversity in on-screen characters felt natural, with casual references to characters being lgbtq+ which was lovely. Marvel take notes.

The human moments in this movie were especially touching. There were so many little moments between characters that brought so much more meaning in such a short time (being vague to avoid spoilers). The villain was creepy, with some excellent acting from Ewan Mcgreggor.

The costuming and set design was colourful and crazy and just precisely Gotham. The comic characters would be right at home in this version of Gotham in my mind. Women wore outfits that were revealing but felt fun and wearable, without the oggling slow-pans up their bodies that I've gotten so used to in movies. Female characters looked human, with visible facial blemishes and messed makeup after fights.

Ella Jay Basco's Cassandra Cain was a stand-out for me. Despite having a different backstory from Cass in the comics, I felt that this alternate version of her had a lot of spirit and sass and her Utter Bafflement at What Her Life Had Become was hilarious and expertly acted.

This movie made me laugh in the theatre more than any other I've seen in the past year. In the same humor genre as Deadpool 2 without being too similar. 12/10, a must see.",10.0,7 February 2020
"Don't get the hate for this one, it was ok","Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) spins off into her own adventure post-Suicide Squad as she deals with the fallout of her break-up with The Joker and faces a new enemy she might just have to take down by joining forces with an unlikely team.

Birds Of Prey (And The Fantabulous Emancipation Of One Harley Quinn) puts Harley Quinn front and centre right off the bat, no pun intended, as she narrates us through her long and bumpy journey from heartbroken mess to fearless anti-hero. The tone is appropriately cartoonish and violent here, one scene showing Harley break into a police station with a shotgun-style weapon, shooting police officers with non-fatal bean bags that explode into either confetti or colorful gas. She is every bit as talky, creative, impulsive and mad as you'd expect, Margot Robbie once again having tons of fun in a role she's taken onboard with gusto.

The big bad she faces is Ewan McGregor's Black Mask (aka Roman Sionis), a night club owner and crime lord who is just as entertaining as he is monstrous: one second showing off his collection of masks with glee, the next second ordering fellow criminal Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina) to slice people's faces off. When Harley destroys a chemicals factory with a bang, the GCPD and everyone she ever wronged under the Joker's protection is on alert, ready to track her down and either bring her to justice or kill her straight-up. Rosie Perez plays Renee Montoya, a detective working the Black Mask case who tries to convince singer Dinah Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), who works at Roman Sionis' club, to become an informant. She also investigates a series of mob killings by a mysterious ""crossbow killer"".

A diamond with a secret code embedded in it that would lead whoever has it to a massive fortune is acquired by Victor Zsasz and then promptly lost to Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), a young pick-pocket, much to Sionis' disappointment. The rest of the film sees Cain befriend Harley Quinn as they meet Dinah (aka Black Canary), Montoya and the crossbow killer Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) before they team up and fight it out with Black Mask and his army of mobsters at an abandoned amusement park. The main characters are a very likable bunch, I should point out, even if Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress is played for laughs when a more genuinely serious and deadpan approach would have actually contrasted well with Harley's over-excited nature and been, ultimately, a lot funnier.

What begins as a fun-packed Harley Quinn-centric solo adventure devolves, then, into a protect-the-macguffin type of plot and, even though a lot of that works and there's never a dull moment in Birds Of Prey, one can't help but feel that a more original story could have been told using all these promising elements. When it's just being silly and having a good time, this is a sharply written film, but when it comes to the storytelling, it's a bit of a mess. Harley Quinn's character arc is very well done as she doubts her ability to be a better person but goes on to grow out of Joker's, and her own, shadow.

The diamond plot, as well as Huntress' backstory and Harley's relationship with Cain all feel too familiar, however. It's nothing we haven't seen before and, considering how confidently anarchic and fresh the first half of the film was, seeing it settle into something cozy and predictable is a tad disappointing.

Still, Birds Of Prey is overall a fun ride: Robbie's Harley Quinn is handled much better than she was in the inferior Suicide Squad, the fights and other action sequences are a treat, the villains are excellent and the humor is hard to resist. It may run out of steam a little in its second half but it remains one of the DCEU's best films so far and it's just a very entertaining popcorn movie.

"Don't go in thinking this is an ""SJW"" movie","It's easy to be upset about what this movie isn't. No there's no Barbara yet, no it's not Gotham City Sirens, but for what it is it's actually a very enjoyable movie.

Margot robbie was amazing as Harley even more so than in Suicide Squad and after seeing her determination to get this movie made, I truly saw why this project means so much to her. There was no point where it seemed like she was trying to make this movie the Harley quinn show but rather a film that spotlights a multitude of DC women who if not for this movie probably wouldn't have seen the light of day this early in the DCEU.

The movie is very funny and has great action scenes, but what makes it most enjoyable is the cast.

Jurnee and Mary killed it at Huntress and Black Canary. This movie is meant to be a backdoor pilot for the Birds of Prey team and it does a really great job setting up their stories so they could operate as the team we've come to know from the comics. Rosie perez makes a great performance as Renee. Ewan was FANTASTIC as Black Mask and his dynamic with Victor Zsasz was great to watch.

Lastly, although Cassandra Cain isn't the same cassandra we know and love from the comics, Ella Jay Basco does an amazing job portraying the Cassandra we see in the film. I can definitely see her shaping into a more comics accurate version of the character in the future.

This isn't the WOKE SJW movie trolls are saying it is. The movie deal with daily misogyny that women have to go through yes but it doesn't come off as an ""agenda"", it's just things that women today deal with often. A female led movie can be empowering without being dismissed as trying to be woke.",10.0,7 February 2020

It's an okay action flick that's got some real energy to it.,"Birds of Prey is an enjoyable film even if it's somewhat lacking in its plot. Harley Quinn truly makes her own in this film more so than she did in Suicide Squad, but the script makes things seem too convenient for the lead characters and their fight against classic Batman-baddie Roman Sionis aka 'Black Mask'. These girls, Harley, Huntress, Black Canary, Renee Montoya and Cassandra Cain all have real chemistry that's more enjoyable than the film's screenplay itself, and I want to see more seamless chemistry like this in future DC movies, and have a plot that doesn't rely too heavily on fanboy-isms like having reverence to the Joker when we never see him: just focus on what IS in the movie and that's more than enough material to work with.

The problem DC has with its live-action shared universe is one that MARVEL's already solved: make the 'character-crossing' seamless and less forced for 'sequel's sake', and just treat it as two interesting characters interacting with, and changing, one another as opposed to becoming obligatory franchise insurance. It'a a form of respectable power play. The DC Animated Universe realised this problem and the DCEU (extended universe) can salvage its worth just yet and fix where it went wrong in that regard.",6.0,22 March 2020
Meehhh,"In regards to the comments saying this is a movie about hating men, and women empowerment, go actually read the comics. This movie is in relation to the comic series Harley Quinn: The Rebirth when she officially ends things with the Joker. The movie isn't about men being bad guys and women being stronger and smarter, its about Harley Quinn finding herself, her voice, her path. For the first time, she isn't making decisions based on if it makes Mistah J (Joker) happy. With all that said, this movie falls flat with the script. The actors are great, but the movie seems rushed and compressed. The characters are only introduced not established. It was like they just threw this together so that it will come out right after Suicide Squad, and it did. The movie has a lot of dead boring spots.

Ewan McGregor seems poorly cast at first, but he settles into it; the whole thing is fun, witty, feminist and kind of joyful - building up to a literal wink at the camera that's entirely in keeping with the tone of the film.

DC's best movie yet,"The title is not an exaggeration. I think most will agree that, even though not all the DC movies are bad, most of them are. Birds of Prey is over the top, fun, funny, and just such a fun watch.

The movie is very similar to the Deadpool movie. They are both told through a nonlinear narrative; both movies are over the top violent; both movies break the fourth wall in spots; and both movies will have you laughing at the crazy things you're seeing on screen.

Margot Robbie was born to play this character. The way she portrays Harley is exactly how you would expect a live action version of the character to be.

Fantabulous Emancipation of One Boring Movie,"This movie is really just about Harley Quinn. All of the scenes with her in it are great. Margot Robbie did a great job. But the rest of the characters are just boring. I really feel that Ewan McGregor was wasted in this movie since he's capable of doing more than he did in this movie. His character of Black Mask is largely wasted in this movie and acts like the typical villain. Also I think the swearing was overdone. Almost every line in this movie has someone saying the F word basically which I attribute to bad writing because it felt so misplaced it made me cringe throughout the movie.

Overall I'd give it a 5/10. It definitely could have been better though and did feel dissapointing.",5.0,12 February 2020

No bats were harmed in the making of the movie.,"I can't say Margot Robbie's jarring Brooklyn accent was any stronger than it was in Suicide Squad, even if I can say it was more jarring, but she is Australian. Add the accent to my dislike of the continuous narrative voice over film model (show don't tell) and it was not the easiest film to get into. But eventually the action began to take over. The humour was evident, and I did have a few loud snickers, even if there were not many belly laughs (possibly because of the voice over). Was Harley the crazed, antic filled, zane-master any true fan of her infamy has come to rely on? Y...e...s... but with a heavier dose of pathos than one could normally feel for the traditional DC villain

The story's divergence from the original DC'verse is not a bad thing when one remembers this is not a 'DC' film. Will it ever stand up next to DC canon, or is it more of what Sony's Fantastic Four is to the Marvel'verse? Probably the latter, but that does not make this a bad film, because it does diverge from the traditional DC with a more modern and workable ideal of female empowerment.",7.0,10 May 2020

Harley Quinn Dumps Joker for Deadpool's Fourth Wall,"Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn was easily the best thing, if not the only good thing, to come out of the atrocious ""Suicide Squad"" (2016), so ""Birds of Prey"" is bound to be better merely by subtraction of everything else from that movie, including her breakup with the unseen Joker. Although both pictures spend considerable time on establishing new characters, ""Birds of Prey"" does a better job of it than the ridiculous, video-game-like expository freeze frames of ""Suicide Squad."" Robbie is a blast in the role again, and the action scenes are fun. Nevertheless, it does rehash a familiar formula from another superhero series, that of ""Deadpool,"" and hardly diverges from the usual superhero fare despite the promise of ""emancipation,"" let alone the fine-to-pop-art inspired drawings for the poster and credits, and the novelty of an all-female team of warriors. Any feminist message seems flippant, given that the plot revolves around the women chasing after a diamond--and even that is reminiscent of another all-female team, with the jewelry heist of ""Ocean's Eight"" (2018). But, hey, they usually don't release supposedly-serious superhero flicks in February; as long as you're not expecting anything more than an amusement-park ride or junk food--both of which literally occupy conspicuous space within the movie, with Quinn's quest to eat a breakfast sandwich and the climactic battle in a funhouse--""Birds of Prey"" is readily consumed and amusing.

Albeit, It's tiresome how much the same these comic-book moving pictures are, but it's to be expected given the amounts of money poured into the genre and the great number of them being produced. Another female-led iteration, ""Captain Marvel"" (2019) cobbled together pieces from the origin stories of Iron Man and Captain America, for instance, along with the retro humor of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014). ""Wonder Woman"" (2017) was something different--until its generic third act. And, it's the same with the men, too. ""Shazam!"" (2019) remains DC's most mimetic movie to date of the MCU formula. Few films are truly original, though, so I appreciate when, at least, filmmakers copy from good movies. In ""Birds of Prey,"" we get the fourth-wall-breaking winking at the camera and direct address to the audience from ""Deadpool"" (2016), along with that narrator (in this case, Quinn) rearranging the plot while she's telling the story. Less original still, we get another character with a generic gangster revenge quest and a hardboiled detective that's so hackneyed that other characters point out how hackneyed it is within the movie. Ewan McGregor hangs around in a nightclub again with a performer who sings better than him, à la ""Moulin Rouge!"" (2001). Robbie even fights and skates to the same song, ""Barracuda,"" she also did both to in a montage from ""I, Tonya"" (2017). As well, there's a more direct reference made regarding the diamond plot to ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" (1953), as Quinn imagines herself in Marilyn Monroe's part after being knocked around at one point.

That Robbie's Quinn doesn't take things seriously and just enjoys herself helps--encouraging the spectator to do likewise. The fight choreography and editing isn't bad, either, although I believe I heard the sound-effects department getting too carried away with some noises merely for kicks and twirls regardless of whether they hit anything. An R rating allows for more carefree and violent fun, as well as a cocaine-enhanced fight sequence involving Quinn--although, it could've and arguably should've gone ever further. Plus, this is a gal who spends more screentime consuming alcohol than she does eating, and when she does have food, it tends to be junk such as sugary cereal and that elusive fatty sandwich. Placing the climax in an amusement park, too, besides being congruent with Quinn and Joker's clownish backstories, is an apt metaphor for the picture at large. ""Birds of Prey"" reflexively knows what it is and gives fans what they expect.",6.0,12 February 2020
5 /10 because its exactly what I thought it would be,"I took my teenage daughter to see this film. We didn't expect a deep meaningful plot or even solid characters. It was just what we thought it would be.. A girl - power fest of cheesy lines, unrealistic fight scenes and a few laughs. I do wish they had actually put some characters with super powers in (apart from one), after all it is a DC movie. The villain has no powers either and is just basically another gangster. This movie is ideal if you just want to pass couple of hours without taxing your brain, and you accept it as a franchise attempt to make a quick movie for the huge non-male audience out there.

Aggressively Ok👍,"Like some of my fellow reviewers have had to state I also have ACTUALLY seen the film. This movie is a solid watch. It won't blow your mind. It dosent remake the genre it's just standard superhero fair like Thor Ragnarok or Shazam. What the film does well is it's fight choreography and actors.Margo Robbie blows it out of the park as Harley Quinn and I can definitely see Jurnee Smollett-Bell in a stand alone Black Canary/Green Arrow film. Ewan McGregor plays a standout villain with a delightfully devilish persona.Another item worth mentioning is the biased right wing reviwers pushing the narative that this film is all ""girl power ra ra ra.""The poltical stance, if you could even call it that, is a small presence in the film. It's subtle like Black Canary needing a hair tie while shes fighting baddies. If you can't handle that then, your not really going to be able to handle any film with a woman in it. From a critical standpoint the film needed a tighter script to for it to go from enjoyable to memorable. All they really needed was Harley, Huntress and Black Canary. Ditch Renee Montoya or at least retool her to a rookie cop out to make it as a detective. Rosie Perez is a fine actor but shes feels very out of place next to a group of badasses like those mentioned above. Cassandra Cain is also a pointless addition to the film. Kids are hard work for me in films, especially the way Cain is written. She has a very interesting back story in the comics. One that is far superior to this adaptation. In closing I'd recomend the movie. It won't blow your mind but its also not a bad way to spend an afternoon.",6.0,14 February 2020

Maybe not that fantabulous,"I'm...surprised? Pleasantly surprised?

The thought of any kind of sequel or spin-off to Suicide Squad, of all films in the DCEU thus far, was enough to make my stomach turn and my eyes roll back far enough for me to be looking at my own brain, but having said that, I'd be downright impressed if this was somehow as bad as Suicide Squad.

There's still quite a gap between ""as bad as Suicide Squad"" and ""actually enjoyable"", however, and I was expecting this to fall somewhere into that gap, but I'll be damned, I actually kind of enjoyed this.

It's far from perfect though, there's quite a few jokes that fall completely flat, the ""lawl randuhm"" presentation is often kind of annoying, there's some serious structural issues, particularly around the middle, there's still the occasional Suicide Squad-esque cringey soundtrack choice, and the potential depth of all the other characters is completely thrown under the bus for Harley's, making them all pretty boring.

Having said that, given that Margot Robbie was just about the only part of Suicide Squad I could see some potential in, I did find myself not really minding all that much that she is the focus, and even though I think I would usually find this character really irritating, she's so damn good in this role that even her not so good one liners didn't really bother me.

The other stand out is Ewan McGregor, who wouldn't have been my first choice for playing Black Mask, but he really does pull off the role of a crime lord, and you can tell he was having a lot of fun with it too.

The story is fine overall, nothing you haven't seen before, but the thing I was possibly most impressed and surprised by were the action scenes. There's quite a lot of them for a film less than two hours long, and they're so much better than I expected. Then I found out that they brought on some of the fight choreographers from the John Wick films, and goddamn does it show.

And I could yammer on about how it's not amazingly directed or shot, but I had fun, and that's already more than I expected, so this is a significant improvement from you know what.",6.0,10 November 2021

Fun as hell but it didn't really earn the R rating.,"I'm not going to say that this movie was a masterpiece of cinema but it was fun as all hell to watch to watch. You could tell that everyone involved with it from script to production design had a great time. I would not recommend this movie to anyone searching for a hardcore action film or even super dirty comedy. This movie could have easily been PG-13 with only minor changes. Birds of Prey is primarily a charter study on Harley Quinn and so If you where annoyed by her in Suicide Squad I would recommend skipping this one. I would also not recommend seeing it if you don't like absurdity as a comedic tool because thats the crux of a lot of the jokes.

Overall a lot of the backlash from this movie comes from an alleged political agenda that I didn't really see much of. It was somewhat there but it was not really intrusive and was really just a natural part of the story. I went into this film ready to cringe but really it wasn't that bad. It's a story about a group of women told from a female perspective but it doesn't really linger on the ""Girl Power"" theme and message like some more poorly written movies. It's just kinda about them. There are a couple of scenes that depict guys being predatory but if you've existed .5 seconds on this earth as a women you know these scenes really aren't all that out there. Also, they both serve a purpose (one to progress the plot the other to establish a villain as being paranoid and unhinged).

I think this movie is more suited to 15-25 year old women than its promotional material made it out to be but I think its still worth seeing if you can stand to turn your brain off a bit and just go along for the bombastic ride. It's colorful and really unique in its presentation at times (although it's still a corporate film so it's not to to out there). Also, the dialogue was this interesting mix of completely wild and more realistic than i'm used to seeing. Women in super hero movies or even just tough coded women are almost always portrayed as snarky and abrasive this movie just doesn't do that and its really refreshing. A lot of the conversations sound like real things that real live women would say to each other just in the context of crazy situations.

"Ignore the Wannabe Fanboys, this is a good film","Just to offset some of the other reviews, most of the reviews on here are trash, either ""hating on a female story and cast"", or some reason people actually thought this was a Birds of Prey movie with harley quinn, not the other way round. Granted, the studio shortened the title that way, but that's your own fault for being too lazy to read the extra words.

The big give away is the narration by Harley Quinn, that would be a big old giveaway as to who's story and which comic books the film are based on.

Harley Quinn is the main character, that is pretty clear from the trailers and what I was expecting going into it. It is also clear this is the story after just breaking up with the Joker. Put simply, this is a Harley Quinn story with the Birds of prey, not the other way round. That's pretty much what you would expect from the full title. Which means this should be like a Harley Quinn comic, where heroes are present in the story, sort of like the Harley Quinn and Power Girl story. It also means that the story is centered largely around her current hatred of Joker and men in general.

It subsequently means (and if you like the Harley Comics, then you would know) that Character Development of Villains really isn't what it is about, and the Villains themselves are not supposed to be taken seriously, nor is any other character in it. Either that, or the characters take everything overly seriously compared to the rest of the content.

My only gripes were the Lack of Beaver jokes and Harley's self control when something happens in a certain part of the film, but other than that, its pretty much on the nose, and along with other recent DC films, Shazam, Wonder Woman and Aquaman, one of the better DC films.

It is definitely better than suicide squad, J league, dawn of justice.",8.0,9 March 2020
Horrible marketing and bad script,"This movie was missing Oracle, first and foremost. If it's going to be called Birds of Prey, then have the actual characters in it. Which leads to the main point as to why it fails. This movie was horribly marketed to the wrong crowd. This was a Harley Quinn movie, not a Birds of Prey movie. And then they changed the name the day it comes out! What? Lastly where it fails Is this female Mary Sue movement that isnt doing any one any favors. Females can be powerful but when its overly done is when it's a gag.

Keep Margot Robbie. She is perfect as Harley. Keep DC rated R. No restraints at this point because anything will help DC. Have Black Label take over because how is Joker overwhelmingly successful then this isnt? WB thanks for the middle finger as a diehard DC fan",6.0,17 February 2020

"""Birds of Prey"" turns out to be empty, tasteless and paradoxically devoid of personality.","So obsessed with appearing quirky and extravagant and completely dependent on its role as a feminist manifesto within the strongman DC world, that it leaves behind everything that could truly make it an interesting addition to the limping DC cinematic landscape. If you strip it of all the colors and all the jokes, in fact, it remains a rather banal plot made unnecessarily complicated by continuous flashbacks and the nerve-racking voiceover; flat and not at all captivating characters and action sequences that lack spectacularity and that rarely exalt as they could and should have.

Wonderfully Uneven,"Harley Quinn is a colorful, surprising, uneven but very loveable character to begin with, which right off the bat (pun intended) is a good summary of the film as well. In her core, Quinn is a selfish person but not always prone to pure evil, making her one of the more interesting personas from the DC Comics and as such, very easy to translate to the silver screen.

It certainly helps that Margot Robbie plays Harley with a relish that suggests the character was solely made for her to perform it one day. What also helps is Ewan McGregor as the bad guy, showing us just how versatile an actor he is, because honestly, the character itself is not particularly interesting, yet Ewan still makes him so.

Critique is also easy to give. The director has chosen to built up the story unevenly, in line with the main character. This both helps and hurts the movie. It helps because it's very creative because of it, but it hurts because you feel the film could have been directed tighter. The end result is that while the cast performs well, comedic timing and fighting is sometimes off. Let's just say the pacing could've been a lot better. It's just not so tight of a film overall.

My main comment however is that because we're so focused on Harley, one of the main stars of this universe is forgotten: The city of Gotham itself. Compared to the many other adventures we've seen in this universe, most notably the absurd but fascinating Gotham series, the city gives us no sense of space or anchorpoint in this film. Thus will really feel like we're missing something because Gotham is supposed to grand, looming over all its characters, almost as it compells them to do evil. It's a real missed chance and a bit baffling to be honest.

Still, it's a fun flick. Whatever the niggles, you gotta live Robbie. Erm... I mean Harley ;)",7.0,2 November 2021
The worst DC movie since Catwoman,"I like DC. I love Batman, and Harley Quinn. I didn't even mind Suicide Squad. But this is unforgivably bad.

No one is denying Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as Harley, but even her performance is borderline hammy. It lacks the originality and charm that made SS good. However, compared to Ewan McGregor's flat, forgettable performance as the underdeveloped antagonist she still shines.

The pace is all over the show. Jumping around with overextended back stories and still introducing characters an hour in it becomes tiresome. Maybe then it's fortunate the storyline is so cliché and predictable it's still easy enough to follow.

As Harley danced across the screen swinging a mallet I could only wish it was me being whacked around the head so I could forget this cheesy mess.",1.0,28 April 2020
Great film.,"After reading other reviews on here I am shocked by the amount of negativity, and felt compelled to create an account purely to leave a review.

This film breaks female stereotypes and smashed prejudice out of the window, breaking norms for these type of film. Current, relevant, funny and relatable. The female leading cast may be too much for the general viewer of these types of films, however for 2020, it's exact what this subculture needs and in my opinion is long awaited. Margot Robbie was outstanding and cast were great, a funny and great performance Colourful, comedic and cartoonic.

A heavily female dominated cast which proved that there is more than just a ""pretty face"" to films like this, and strongly represents that females can kick ass without barring all. Great and realistic choreography. Pays great homage to tank girl (I think Margot would be a great Tank Girl) 100x better than any stiff Marvel Film which seem to get out standing reviews for stiff acting and boring storylines.",10.0,6 September 2020
Needed more time,"It needed more time, this kind of story needs to be a part of a mini-series. For what it was worth, it was entertaining. It doesn't have the ""Men are bad"" thing to it that people are trying to portray it as.

But yeah, it needed more time to develop characters or it needed less characters and well... it is Birds of Prey, it needed the characters. So that means they needed to develop them.

It had potential to be good, to be better then all the other empowerment movies, mostly because it wasn't pushing an agenda that turns people away. It just fell flat though.",6.0,16 May 2020

An Overall Letdown,"Birds of Prey (And The Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) Review:

Birds of Prey follows Harley Quinn, after splitting with the Joker, joining superheroes Black Canary, Huntress and Renee Montoya to save a young girl from an evil crime lord, Roman Sionis. Going in I didn't know what to expect. When the first trailer dropped it looked like a movie that would either be really good or really bad. After the disaster of Suicide Squad it would be hard to recover with a sort of continuing story. I guess it's good that I didn't have much for expectations because this was a pretty average movie. The reviews for this are actually pretty high on Rotten Tomatoes. I think it's because you can either give a positive or negative score. Since it's not terrible and just fine, most are positive. First off I thought the acting was wonderful. Margot Robbie does an amazing job of becoming a whole new character in ever single film she's in. I think she's one of the best actresses of our time currently. She nails this role perfectly and nobody else could play Harley Quinn as good as her. Ella Jay Basco plays Cassandra Cain, a girl that Ewan McGregor's character is after. For only being 13 years old, she did a really fine job. Her character was funny and so free spirited that her scenes were just a joy to watch. I would love to see her in more roles. Now onto Roman, played by McGregor. It's a given that McGregor is a fantastic actor and seems to never do poorly. He delivers well in this, however I just thought he was such a weak villain. It's mainly due to the writing and poor character development to him, and basically ever character except for Robbie and Basco. The story centers around Basco stealing a diamond from Roman. Roman is a rich guy that essentially controls whoever and whatever he wants. Since his diamond is gone he wants to kill this girl. If that's not an overdone villain story, I don't know what is. The whole thing was just underwhelming and predictable. That was the most disappointing part of the movie. The second most disappointing aspect was the whole Birds of Prey part of it. This essentially a Harley Quinn movie, some theaters even renamed it to Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey due to underperformance at the box office. The Birds is Prey stuff doesn't even start till the last 20 minutes. We meet some of the characters throughout, mainly Renee Montoya, but they don't even team up till the end. Huntress, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, shows up two times before the team up and we don't even know who she is. I will admit the Birds of Prey part was really fun to watch and all of the other fighting scenes. It's just if you're going to name it Birds of Prey, have the story focus of the Birds of Prey. This is an entertaining movie to watch. It's colorful, crazy, and there's always something happening. The set design is really good in my opinion, especially the end in a clown house kind of place. One other thing I would maybe have changed was the editing which also goes back to storytelling. This is all told from Harley Quinn so everything is scrambled up mainly at the beginning and could sometimes be too random. Usually a movie had three acts but it was so hard to figure out when they started and ended where I only saw two while watching it. Birds of Prey isn't by all means a bad movie, it's just a disappointment because it could've been really good. To some, this will probably be a good movie, but in comparison to other action or superhero movies, it's a letdown.

Birds of Prey (2020) The Most Underrated Film in the DCEU,"I confess that the first time I watched this movie I hated it and considered it one of the worst in the entire history of this DC universe. However, watching it again I realize that he has many qualities and many people, including myself, have been unfair to him. The direction is wonderful and the action scenes have a certain exaggeration that works and combines very well with the atmosphere of the film. The scenes are colorful, fantastic and beautiful to watch. Margot Robbie is very comfortable in the role and manages to deliver an even better job than what was presented in Suicide Squad. Some other roles don't work either and the villain doesn't really do it, it seems a bit over the top, not as much as the Joker but still over the top. There is a lack of development for the villain and for the secondary characters, the film is definitely not Birds of Prey, but Harley Quinn. He can't develop a good drama, but the comedy works a lot. It's not a horrible movie and it's also far from great, it has its merits and demerits like any other.",6.0,29 July 2023
Decent fun.,"The main negatives with this movie were that the city of Gotham wasn't portrayed as it should've been (too bright, colorful, noisy, etc) and during a couple of the action scenes some henchman were defeated ridiculously easily (I thought I saw some fall down for no reason which will sometimes happen with these kinds of movies). Plus it was a little unfocused at times. Otherwise, it was fun and had some humor that wasn't too bad! I liked the casting and Margot Robbie played Harley Quinn well as always. I probably won't want to watch this movie again and there are better DC movies for sure but this isn't one of the worst!",7.0,30 April 2023

Also, canon was a mess -- Harley wasn't in the Birds of Prey. No Batgirl. Black Canary is no longer a blonde because she is African American. Black Mask is a mess. Huntress is no longer a super, just a pissed off orphan. The whole movie reeked of ""boys are bad, girls are good"" message. I enjoyed it but won't see it again or buy the DVD.

Horrible,"The best thing I can say about Birdbrains oops Birds of Prey is it was better then Joker and Paradise Hills. Paradise Hills is the worst movie I ever saw ( Joker is second). Paradise Hills and Birds of Prey have things in common. They both came out this year, and they are both male hating feminist crap. It took a long time for me to find a worse performance by a woman in a comic book movie then Alice Silverstone in Batman and Robin, but Margot Robbie ( Harley Quinn and ( especially) Rosie Perez ( Renee Montoya) were that bad. They made Silverstone's Batgirl seem like Christian Bale's Batman. A special hate is for the fight scenes, which made the Batman TV show which was not to be taken seriously, seem like the Dark Knight Trilogy.. I cannot believe all of the high grades this film is getting on IMDB. Those people must be well HIGH on something, because they have had a fantasy that this film was good. Now maybe, I am the wrong demographic for Birds of Prey: Male, straight, conservative and over the age of five, so it is to be expected, I would not find it the least bit entertaining, but I just do not get the love ( although not to the degree that Phoenix winning the Best Actor Oscar for Joker did). The Best thing about Birds of Prey? It did not get me angry like Paradise Hills and Joker did. Since IMDB does not allow her zero stars. I have to give it one star above.

Fantabulous!,"As someone who went into this movie expecting the worst to happen, I really enjoyed it so much!

I hated the trailers for this movie and thought that the material was unnecessary to make a film out of but nonetheless it was made and I watched it regardless.

The movie's timeline was a bit sloppy at certain times, but it was manageable to work through. I would also like to say that it was weird when swapping between two different characters perspectives. It was very abrupt!

Enough of the bad and on with the good! This movie was stunning! The costume design was so colorful and vibrant. It felt like the entire movie was a carnival, full of all these fun rides you can go on.

The action sequences went by quickly but were very VERY vErY enjoyable! I do wish we could see more badassery from all the characters because it was so.. AWESOME!

Margot Robbie owns the role of Harley Quinn and honesty blew me away! All the characters in the movie were great in their own sort of way and had their own quirks. Each person felt unique and different, but fell into the puzzle in some sort of way.

I am so glad to see a live action black mask, even though it was short-lived ;) and Black Canary gave me a run for my money💰. Huntress was probably the most coolest yet less understood character's but was super cool nonetheless.

They entire film summarized ""men are perverts and women are all powerful"". Don't take this as women are worse than men or they don't deserve equality or respect or something like that at all I believe they deserve all of those things, but this movie literally has no redeeming men at all, every guy is a perv and makes you want to punch them in the face, it drops the movie down because no one enjoys so many scenes that make you grossed and pissed at every dude in the movie. There are so so many underlying messages and lines about feminism and whatnot, which is not bad in real life OK, but dang it I just want a good dc movie about comics and super hero's.

"IGNORE 90% of the User Reviews, but not this one!","Let's get this straight, Birds of Prey is a pretty good movie, objectively. It sits somewhere between a 6.5 - 7.0 rating. It's quirky, violent, styalized, stylish, and has some very well choreographed action set-pieces. John Wick's director stepped in to help out - that should give you an indication of the hyper styalized hard hitting action and general tone of the film. Brutal and Fast-paced.

Some characters are a little underdeveloped, and the story is quite simple. It has flaws, but nothing too glaring. Its a fun time and worth the price of admission.

Now let's address the elephant in my pants ... The REASON you are seeing so many 1 star reviews is because, for whatever reason, the studio decided to market this film as a ""woke"" movie, which often garners a negative audience reaction. Birds of Prey is perceived as a ""Man-bashing"" and ""Anti-male"" movie, and to an extent . . . it is. I really wish I could defend this movie, because I did enjoy it, but I can't.

Every male character is despicable. Every theme has patriarchal undertones or overtones. From men acting like a-holes in the workplace, to men calling women b*tches, to men controlling women, to men being portrayed as rapists and backstabbers, to women losing out on promotions to less competent and less capable male counterparts etc. It's throughout the movie. Couple this with the general female empowerment message, and the feminist marketing campaign and it just didn't FEEL right. The movie came across as slightly mean spirited and sexist. And this is coming from someone who actually liked the movie and went in open minded.",7.0,13 February 2020

A very heartbroken DC fan...,"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. It suffered from a lot of issues. My chief concern is that the people that made the movie had only a preliminary understanding of 'Birds of Prey' and didn't quite comprehend its nature. Then rather than focusing on ensuring the basic building blocks were given the proper amount of care, added insult to injury by stuffing the movie full of unnecessary fluff.

This is the nth time that newer movies have fantastic source material to work with but completely trip over themselves due to hamfisted messaging that makes the characters and plot suffer various inconsistencies. In addition it becomes fairly obvious about mid-way through the film that minimal attention was spared on a properly thought-out interpersonal dynamic and the setup that leads to it in the movie.

I should clarify that I am in no way detached or unsympathetic to the monumental undertaking that translating a graphic novel/comic book/etc to cinema is. I understand that the product tends to turn into a caricature of the original that's glazed in creative liberties and changes but this is a bit much. The way that 'Birds of Prey' worked does not really match what is seen on screen. The changes are so significant and unnecessary that the entire basic premise no longer matches and fails in a rather fundamental manner. The kid was seriously like throwing a lego block into a 1000 piece puzzle and saying 'yeah, that works'.

While I enjoy non-sequitur storytelling and character development, it truly seems as if this movie suffers from a lack of clear and concise boundaries. It feels like a hot mess that jumps from one thing to the next and doesn't really provide much in terms of emotional bond or build-up that makes me as a viewer feel invested in the characters and their plights.

The villains and 'bad dudes' of Gotham were almost 90% of the time more fleshed out and methodical, even in the original portrayal of the Birds of Prey. What we're shown here is by far a very stark contrast that feels like it's from a completely different intellectual property and universe. It feels as if they're just hollow vehicles to try and propagate the obnoxiously polarized generalization of 'man bad, woman good' that so many people mindlessly succumb to these days.

This had such tremendous potential that was wasted for all the wrong reasons. I think Margot Robbie was fantastic. While I don't care for the re-imagined version of Harley Quinn- I definitely think that she handled the role rather well and the mannerisms were fairly true to her character.

I'm honestly seriously heartbroken about this. I was looking forward to this movie a lot despite my trepidation after having watched the absolute trainwreck that 'Suicide Squad' was.",2.0,28 December 2020

But the story is told in such an odd way that doesn't really suit the tone. I think one of the actresses made a choice to do an accent that sounded weird (not Harley btw). All the promo made it seem as if the girls were gonna team up in the beginning and the movie would focus on that, which is not the case. Even though the action is so good, there's just sooo much of it. Also I think this films are wacky tone could have benefitted from a little bit more humour.

Will Osprey ?,"DC's vaguely linked extended universe continues with ""Birds Of Prey"", a Harley Quinn centric movie that spins off from the events of ""Suicide Squad"" but includes few other links to the wider world.

Having definitively split from her puddin', Harley (Margot Robbie) finds herself fair game for every villain and scumbag who was previously too scared of retribution to get their revenge on her. Captured by Black Mask (Ewan McGregor), Harley bids for her freedom by promising to find Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), a pickpocket who has stolen a diamond that he desires. She both opposes and befriends more of Gotham's disenfranchised female heroes, until they unite against a mutual foe.

I wish I'd written my review before I heard Marc Bernardin give his impression about the film, he's so capable of extolling a full argument I forget what's actually my opinion and what's his. I remember that I liked film once it got going. I don't think that the time jumping during the opening half improved matters. I felt it kept pulling me away from what I wanted to see at just the point it was getting interesting. Subsequently though, the second half of the film, when the gang are together is much better. Pacing issues aside, the fight scenes in the film are wonderful - particularly Harley's jailbreak and the fight involving all the cast towards the end of the film. Tonally it's great, not wildly dissimilar to ""Deadpool"" with its animated sequences and fantasy moments but it's very R-Rated, with swearing and violence to suit that. The music is fabulous too.

What the movie doesn't do enough is get us to care about the characters beyond Harley. We get enough to understand their motivations but actual investment, not so much, and I suppose that's true for the film in general. It's fine but lacking in genuine consequence. A stepping stone to introduce a few characters we might, or might not, see again and a vehicle for Harley, who we definitely will.

Deadpool meets Scott Pilgrim in the most glorious way.,"One thing you can guarantee about superhero movies is that they often convey in their style, the tone of their main characters. And in this case that's a whole lot!

Firstly the entire film hinges on Margot Robbie and there are moments in this film where I am suddenly reminded: Oh yeah, this is the actress that played Tonya Harding in I, Tonya! I forget how incredible she is until Harley is suddenly draped in humanity and Robbie activates her acting glands. In this film you can see her pain and her humanity and her strife and I was truthfully moved by that because it's made tangible and relatable inbetween all the funsies. But she's also so lively and likeable and she infuses Harley (appropriately) with the spirit of a live-action cartoon.

Little stings of humanity reinforce Harley as a lived-on character; too often we see comic characters as untouchable, unknowable statues, they seldom pick up groceries, or live in dumps, or get smashed and cause trouble because they're unhappy. The script normalises Harley in an interesting way.

These props go to the script which manages to feel like a solid superhero movie and a sort of cop film while also linking all the characters together in a cat's cradle of interweaving. But the real star is Cathy Yan who is a really accomplished director here; the film is often beautiful and balanced between comic booky and grounded, but she just manages to capture these women so well, we look upon them with a kind of fresh look; they're powerful and sexy but not viewed through male gaze, they're fun and rich.

And I was thinking during the (solidly satisfying action) that I've never seen such a creative use of roller skates in action before, and that stems mostly from male dominated action protagonists, and I was grateful for something so exciting and unique. The hair tie moment and many others were a simple breath of fresh air. I'm also sick of the macho samey nonsense in films and the sexism. Further to this I enjoyed the respect given to Harley Quinn's lore; Her Psychiatrist background is referenced plenty, but also her madness is explored by her talking to camera and also a voice-over that infers she's talking to herself. Also, that comment about what crazy actually was, was a cute, grounding commentary and a get out of jail free card to the film approaching the idea of her craziness.

Black Mask was terrible and nonsensical and not at all the imposing monster he was in the comics, however, Roman Sionis as a character was very compelling; a rich, entitled, greedy, spoilt Trump-figure who saw Gotham and its inhabitants as his toys; roaming around showing off his masks and patronising and mansplaining his way around his spoils. As a generic mob boss (and his unexplained penchant for removing faces) failed, where his moments of unmasked, unbridled showings of sexual power and dominance was breathtakingly disgusting and effective and I was glad (for some reason) that a woman wrote it and a woman directed it. Zasz was also a welcome surprise, a good actor, fuelling Sionis, and with a rich arc for a henchman.

The sets were bad and some of the locations suffered from too much dark blue and atmospheric fog, and the actual Birds of Prey were scant together; relegated largely just to a third act fight.

I'm sure this film will be rated less once the novelty of it wears of, but the experience I had was fantastic watching it. And hand on heart, I could definitely stand to see another one, one with the gang all together, and I didn't miss Batman or the Joker one bit.",8.0,11 February 2020

I really enjoyed it! I do have some critics in the dialogue, but the tone that was given to us at the beginning, stayed with the movie throughout the whole time. It's action packed.

The fighting is amateurish with no talking at all during the scenes. The writer seriously couldn't think of any funny quips or crazy remarks? This is Harley Quinn we're talking about! Why do so many bad guys not carry guns? Why do the police that have guns never use them? Why does the Huntress fight close range when she has a bow? It doesn't make sense!

Then there's the costumes that don't remind me of any of the characters and one costume seems solely made for a wet tee moment so we can see her bikini underneath. None of the colors or styles look good or even feel like Harley Quinn.

Hot Mess,"I went into the theater with pretty close to zero expectations for ""Birds of Prey,"" and for the first 1/3 of the film, I thought that maybe I had it all wrong. While the plot is so thin as to be almost non-existent, the storytelling was done in a non-linear way with a cute Margot Robbie voiceover that made it interesting to watch. The style and visuals were interesting and it seemed to be going for a kind of self-depreciating ""why so serious?"" take on the superhero genre, similar to the wildly popular ""Deadpool."" There was potential for a good film there.

But this all fell apart quickly, and the rest of the movie caved in on itself in service of moving the ridiculous plot forward and the seemingly obligatory ""superhero"" action sequence of all the girls kicking butt, which was so corny and over the top I couldn't tell anymore if the film was taking itself seriously or had devolved into satire (I suspect the former, sadly). There is one moment in the fight sequence where the film totally ""jumps the shark"" so to speak and my theatre erupted in laughter (anyone who has seen the movie should know exactly what I'm talking about). The only redeeming thing that carried me to the end was Margot Robbie's acting, as she is interesting to watch in every scene. All of the other characters are cardboard cutouts.

""Birds of Prey"" seems to have gotten filmmaking backwards. Good films start with solid plot and interesting characters and have their messages (if any) come out naturally. ""Birds of Prey"" starts with notions of female empowerment, women beating up men, and toxic masculinity, and attempts to build a story around these fixed and immobile points. Such an approach can never, and will never, succeed in making a good film.",4.0,15 February 2020

Abysmal casting doesn't help either. African-American Dinah Lance? Come on. That is disrespectful to everyone. The Huntress looks has only passing similarities to actual Huntress (Helena Wayne) from comics.

The police station scene and the Amusement Mile action is at times quite clever and fun to look at, different. Especially the last one like a funhouse. Shame about the endless slowmotions and horrible hip music. No orchestra, supensefull or 'fun fair/circus' music, that's sacrilegious enough!

A lot of squawking birds,"Although not saying much, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn was one of the best thing in the lacklustre D.C. outing ""Suicide Squad"" of 2016. Now, she returns in her own vehicle. Jared Leto's Joker is a thing of the past (clearly he wasn't keen on dredging up the past for even a cameo in this one).

Harley had spent years building up a catalog of enemies in Gotham, with no-one daring to lift a finger for fear of ""the big J's"" retribution. With that now a thing of the past, the streets are no longer safe for Harley. Whereas most characters have a reason to want to kill Harley, mid-level gangster Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor) has a list as long as his arm (a blurred list that will probably make freeze-framing of the blu-ray entertaining!). Roman, who has a penchant for having his right-hand man Victor (Chris Messina) de-glove his victim's faces, has his heart set on obtaining a missing diamond that (McGuffin-alert) is engraved with account details to $billions.

Through a convoluted and messy plot, Harley meets various 'birds of prey' who are either friend or foe: notably young pickpocket Cassandra (Ella Jay Basco); cop Renée Montoya (Rosie Perez); the ""Crossbow Killer"" (Mary Elizabeth Winstead); and the ""Black Canary"" (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), who you don't want to let near your best glasses.

As you might expect from your knowledge of Harley Quinn's character, the movie is crazy, with periodic breaking of the 4th wall; much acrobatic kick-boxing; and some random dream sequences..... Robbie as Marilyn is particularly entertaining, although at times (the 'egg sandwich' sequence in particular) the gurning made me muse to myself about just what a good film ""I, Tonya"" was.

It all comes across as something of a ""Deadpool"" sequel. Actually, I'd more describe it as ""Deadpool-lite"" since it's not powered here by the charisma of Ryan Reynolds. However, I did find myself quite enjoying the first reel of the movie.

Unfortunately, it didn't last.

It all just becomes incredibly tiresome. Although Margot Robbie is very good in the role, Harley's incessant squawking just gets annoying.

Also in this battle of men vs women, the women always win and are (mostly) completely unscathed. In one particular scene there are 5 or 6 burly men taking on Harley: clearly she whips their sorry asses in improbable fashion. What? Only one at a time guys?

If you were confused by the timeline of ""Little Women"", this will blow your mind! It makes Greta Gerwig's masterpiece look as linear as ""News at Ten""! It's really difficult to follow at times as the timeline flashes forwards and backwards and sideways at random!

Also confusing (for me anyway... did I have a nap?) was the finale. There's something to do with a ring which made NO SENSE to me at all? Am I alone in that?

Ewan MacGregor has fun with his role as the gay (I assume?) gangster, but it all turns cartoonish at times. But perhaps, that's the point? However while the violence in ""Deadpool"" was cartoonishly funny (as in Tom and Jerry) the violence here is decidedly of the vicious and unpleasant variety, with a vindictive edge. It makes you not particularly like any of the movie's characters.

The movie is written by Christina Hodson, who is slated to write too more upcoming superhero films: ""The Flash"" and ""Batgirl"". The director is Chinese director Cathy Yan in only her second directorial feature.

Summary: It's loud and brash and at 109 minutes it overstays its welcome by about 20 minutes. Less would have been more. It's somewhat better than ""Suicide Squad"" (which I unfathomably seem to have given 2.5 stars to), but it's still a movie that I will struggle to remember in a month's time.",6.0,15 February 2020

Everything that suicide squad wanted to be,"The film has potential, but it does not take much risk, having a slightly slapstick humor that comes from the harlequin and that sometimes tries something more daring, and that sometimes it really succeeds. Something that bothered me in this film is its rhythm, which tries to appear electric and shaking, but I believe that the narration off is not a good way to speed things up. As for the characters ... I liked everyone (maybe the hunter was a little off, but whatever) I especially liked the villain, who in this film has much more personality than in his original material, Ewan Mcgrory is fantastic and manages to give his character unique ways. I didn't really like the ending, kind of anti-climatic. Anyway, this film is everything that suicide squad tried to be, but in this film the fights are frantic and fantastic, the soundtracks are really used in a right way, it has a good villain, an ok script and, most importantly, it has a good montage, something very teen, something that is not enough to be boring and / or tiring, in addition to valuing your characters much more than suicide squad.

"Harley Quinn is back, and better than ever","Birds of Prey was nothing like I expected and was so much better than I expected. Cathy Yan delivers a fresh, stylistic, frenetic, mad joyride of a film. The movie is full of energy, with visceral, jaw-dropping fight sequences and a whole lot of f-bombs, which more than earns the movie's R-rating (and I'm glad it did). Margot Robbie commands the screen as Harley Quinn, but I also want to give credit to Ewan McGregor's Black Mask, who steals every scene he's in. And I can't say enough about Jurnee Smollett-Bell's Black Canary. All I can say is I want more.",9.0,7 February 2020
Better than I was expecting,"After suicide squad, boy oh boy were my hopes low. I HATE suicide squad. Birds of Prey did a total 180.

Not only was it much more violent and intense than I had imagined, it was far funnier than the trailers led it to be. There are many people that are wanting this film to fail for some reason. I have no feelings for DC or Marvel, so I could see this with an open mind.

I really liked the plot, the characters were all pretty enjoyable. The villain was a bit one dimensional and annoying, but Margot Robbie carries the whole movie.

It picks up!,"This one starts S-L-O-W-L-Y. It took 45 mins before I cared about ANYTHING. The performances are solid to great, the directing is basically an assignment at the Deadpool School of Directing (decently done), but it is the writing that fails this film. The second half is entertaining with awesomely choreographed fight scenes and Harley's playful/psycho side no longer feels contrived. While Ewan McGregor's Black Mask is a wonderful personification of the no-consequences, entitled frat boy culture, it loses a bit of its effectiveness because every single man is evil or incompetent. I am not certain if this is meant to mirror the standard Hollywood portrayal of women or...not? Finally, I found it odd that the movie used the same bookending device as Hudson Hawk. All that said, much better than Aquaman (whatever that is worth).",6.0,1 March 2020
A Swing and a Miss,"The movie really tries to capture the whimsical and chaotic nature of Harley Quinn, but it ends up being a bizarre mess.

Finally a film that doesn't have to mansplain feminism,"Sure, it may not be strictly true to the comic books. Sure, it may not be a film that appeases a mans idea of a superhero/anti-hero/villain movie, but what this film has is a subtlety that all other female DC films lack. It's about women and female empowerment without forcing it down your throat. It doesn't mansplain feminism. It's cool and entertaining just because. The action scenes are amazing. It's humorous, and bloody and coming back to what DC are good at. Long gone are the days of them trying to balance PG family friendliness with grit (aka suicide squad and the entire batman v superman franchise). This film is straight up great-time gold.

"Didn't wanna believe the negative reviews, but they were right","This movie has a stellar performance from Margot Robbie! She's one of the only reasons to see this film. She fully embraced the anarchy of Harley Quinn and isn't just eye candy like in suicide squad. Also the action is colorful and fun. The humor from Harley Quinn mostly worked.

Unfortunately everything else is very one note and bad, namely the awful plot. I'd argue that this movies story is even worse than suicide squad. It's so disposable and cliche, it's about a power hungry villain wanting a diamond stolen from a thief. All the other characters are either redundant or pointless. Black mask is just another angry rich jerk, the thief kid is laughably underdeveloped, and huntress feel like she belongs in a different movie. Lastly, this didn't really need to be a birds of prey movie, they don't team up until the very end and it felt awkward and forced.

A Crazanity Of Colour: Birds Of Prey Is Fun And Not Much Else,"Birds of Prey is less of an origin story for the team comprised of Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) as it is a Harley Quinn spinoff. Ewan McGregor, who plays the villain, Black Mask, seems kind of dull, but that is mostly due to a dull script. The film shines in its direction and cinematography, with bright flashy colours and badass fight scenes. All of the actors are great but of course the real star is Margot Robbie, who has perfectly embodied this character since 2016's Suicide Squad. Other than dull character depth and script, this movie is nothing short of fun. Its funny, its badass, it celebrates female empowerment, and its not too long like some superhero movies (looking at you Batman V Superman). Overall, Birds of Prey is a fun time that is forgettable.

Not the best but entertaining,"This is a movie with a not very believable narrative, but it still manages to entertain.

The plot of this movie sounds a bit silly, as well as the way the story is told is not the best, somehow this movie manages to interest us in this story and its characters, which have a decent development but we don't know them completely, maybe it's because in a sequel they will. The direction is good in the action scenes since the blows look real, but it fails in the scenes where many extras attack the protagonists because it is implausible to get out of it very easily. The performances are not the best but they are convincing as the actresses show how talented they are, just as Ewan McGregor does a great job. The soundtrack of the film works very well, the special effects are not the best but they are believable.

The movie doesn't have the best narrative, just as the plot is incongruous and convenient, but for some reason it manages to be entertaining and makes you interested in the characters, another factor that helps is the well-executed action scenes.",7.0,14 April 2022

Mad Love Redux,"I'll make this short and sweet. I loved this film; granted the title of the film is long and tedious. I'm a huge marvel and dc geek so I judge heavily to a degree on superhero films. I'll say this off the bat; if you go into this film expecting anything other than a silly and action packed romp then you will be utterly disappointed. The story is a sequel of sorts to Suicide Squad after she breaks up with the Joker, and her trying to survive against Black Mask. Margot Robbie plays Harley Quinn superbly; even better than Suicide Squad I'd wager. The acting besides her was decent. Ewan McGregor played Black Mask to the best of the script which was still the strongest DCEU villain to date. Black Canary and Cassandra Cain were equally cool. I personally didn't like the cop Montoya or Huntress who played an overly goth child with rage issues and reminded me of a poor attempt at Sigourney Weaver; Zsasz also was blah to me compared to the Zsasz in Gotham. The humor was rampant and relentless; had me laughing at numerous spots. The action was constant and had some cringe worthy scenes for some who don't have the strongest stomaches. Go and see it for Bruce the hyena. I rated it a 10 for pure entertainment gold.

Good,"As for the female cast, Rosie Perez surprises as Renée Montoya and brings a character whose reality practically does not change from beginning to end: she starts the film trying to overcome the machismo of the police and ends up failing, but what changes is her look at these problems and that's what matters, after all. In fact, the whole team goes through this change of look: Canário goes against the abusive environment that his boss, Roman ""Black Mask"" (interpreted in a very caricatural way by Ewan McGregor), provides; Huntress guarantees her means of achieving what she most longs for and then sees that her final plan was just the beginning of something much bigger; and Cassandra Cain finds strength in a place she never expected - but she is, by far, the least worked character among the five women. The Hunter of Mary Elizabeth Winstead definitely deserved more space for having the motivation more linked to Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina) and Roman, but any and every scene in which she appears (whether current or flashback) makes every second count.

A month ago, the Brazilian voice actress she gave life to the character and DC fans always asked for her in the works ... now I'm going to talk about the new voice actress from the Brazilian Harlequin Evie Saide she has a very similar voice from Iara and it was her first job and I found her voice acting not I would say neither bad nor good anymore I liked it and I hope she finds a perfect voice for the character!",7.0,10 February 2020

If the writers had to sink to a F bomb or two in every scene they defiantly was targeting a very narrow audience.

I like the way the film is not for the whole family, this is clearly meant to be a DC film for adults. Margot Robbie really steals it has Harley Quinn, but the other actors are also good, Ewan McGregor chews up the scenes has the crime boss, giving a funny and intense performance. Rosie Perez and Mary Elisabeth Winstead are also entertaining. The film never tries to be anything more than what it is. Not a masterpiece but just an entertaining comic book film for adults.

Doesn't meet its potential...,"On paper this should have been a great movie, with a great cast, focusing on Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, which was one of the highlights from David Ayer's Suicide Squad...and the other female characters who make up the Birds of Prey. (Although Oracle is missing from this one, and is replaced by Renee Montoya...)

Unfortunately this film is overthought and overacted. Even Ewan McGregor who is normally always pretty solid is very unconvincing as the films main bad guy, Black Mask.

They play up too much to the ""clown"" aspect of Harley Quinn, and jump around with the narrative to try and convey the ""mad"" personality she has...but it just doesn't work. Same goes with the other female leads, all great actresses but they don't convey enough depth to their characters here...the film feels rushed and tries to do too much with the time it has, as well as recreating some comic strip scenes, rather than being its own creation.

Just Above Decent,"Compared to Suicide Squad it's an improvement for the DCEU.

Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is great. This is her movie. Some have complained that because it's Harley's the movie shouldn't have been named Birds of Prey, but instead of been titled solely after Harley. I don't think it's a big deal and don't believe people should be angry with it being Birds of Prey.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Helena Bertinelli/The Huntress, Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Dinah Lance/Black Canary, and Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya we're all good portraying their character who were the Birds of Prey. The movie could've, and should've, followed The Huntress. Compared to all of the main characters in this film The Huntress had the least screen time. The Huntress arguable had a bigger connection with the main conflict in this and should've been a bigger presence in the film. Black Canary was an interesting character. The film should've addressed an ability of Black Canary before near the end, which is my only complaint for the character. Renee Montoya was the weakest link in the Birds of Prey, but was still a fine character.

Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis/Black Mask was really good. I was really surprised how much I actually enjoyed Black Mask in this film. Black Mask was a grade A douchebag. The only issue with Black Mask was his motivation. I'm only going to say that his motivation wasn't great and obviously could've been a lot better. The film states that there are many reason why Black Mask might hate Harley, but the reason given for his hatred wasn't a good reason.

Christina Hodson was the writer for the film. The story that she wrote was a pretty good story. The issue with it was that it was a nonlinear style story. The nonlinear style of the story is a real negative for the film. If you compare this film's nonlinear story telling to a film like Deadpool, it's easy to see that Birds of Prey failed to properly tell the story compared to Deadpool.

Overall Birds of Prey was a fine movie. How the story was told was a major negative and should've been told in a linear story style. Black Mask was a really good villain, but should've had a better motivation. The DCEU has made improvements with their films, but still have some work to do.",6.0,12 February 2020
Harley Quinn is the best character!,"In a film about the birds of prey and harley quinn, it seems that this film is far too much harley and little less birds of prey. And that may be it's only saving grace, as Margot Robbie slays it as Harley once again and the scenes with harley herself were amazing. However, when introducing the birds of prey who are supposed to be the ""heros"" of the film (as they are in the comic books), they suddenly have been spun into anti-heroes with the only interesting one being huntress, who at times can be rather dull.

This film would've been much better if it was just a harley quinn film, without constant nods to comic book characters who have been changed so much they are unrecognisable.

The fact that most of the comic book character references have to be literally told to the audience because they are so different, shows that they strayed too far from the source material when they could've created new characters that would have stood well by themselves without fan boy expectations.

The greatest part of this film is the beginning and only the beginning. I have watched this film many times and each time that is the only part that ever sticks in my mind.",4.0,8 April 2023
One Fun Harley Quinn Film Despite the Politics and Imbalance,"LIKES:

Funny Writing Good Use Of All Characters Expansion Of Characters The Action At The End Feels Very Much Like A Comic Book Presentation Margot Robbie's Portrayal of Harley past the first act

DISLIKES: Boring At Times The Presentation At Times The Cursing At Times The Action Is Okay In The Middle Of the Movie Slow Motion Over Use The Politics Again The Main Villain Is Lame... again



The VERDICT:

You may have heard this is the best DC movie in the longest time, and others not so much. This reviewer thinks that the film is the middle of the pack, beating my expectations on many things, but still looking for some tightening up to help get the same levels that Wonder Woman and Shazam held for me. It's got the edge, the attitude, the fun and the use of characters and character development was a major selling point for me. I found this to be a fun comic book movie though, with a new aged flare and promise for some more fun films starring Ms. Robbie. However, I'd like the politics to be toned back a bit, put some more though into the villains like they did the protagonists, and make the action have the dynamic energy that I know they can do and not rely so much on the slow-motion versions that DC loves. Still, this movie I think is worth a trip to the theaters and would encourage you to get out there and see it if you have time.

My scores are:

Action/Adventure/Crime: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",7.0,7 February 2020
Not as bad as many would have you believe.,"Don't get me wrong, it's still not a good movie, but there's enough good in it to appeal to many folks.

Without going in to too much detail, this feels like a classic case of studio fiddling...which seems to be a hallmark of Warner Bros' comic book adaptations. Throughout the entire film you get the sense that the movie that was pitched, the screenplay that was written, the movie the actors showed up for and poured their hearts into, the film the director made, the movie the studio mucked with, and the movie we wound up with are all vastly different creatures. You get the sense that at least one of those iterations would've made an enjoyable romp...but the finished product isn't one of those. Watch this for some great action moments and fun performances from actors who seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves ... but don't expect anything beyond the typical disjointed Warner slog.",6.0,6 June 2020
Better than the trailer made it look like,"Better than I expected but there is still lots of room for improvement for DC Films if you compare them to Marvel. Still ist a step Forward. The film is entertaining becuase it doesnt take itself too seriously, and especially the anti hero character of Harley Quinn is built up well. But just like with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" Franchise with Jack Sparrow for example, the filmmakers can be happy to have that charater there because the other ones would make a bland film. Mostly thanks to the Fresh Performance by Margot Robbie, the film really has many memorable Moments. Ewan McGregor was okay as the villain (tho Arent most of them actually viallains? ) however exagerrated a Little bit at times. Of the other Girls Rosie Perez was the best one, while I wasnt a big fan of Mary Elizabeth Weinstein who had a cool character but played it in a very boring and unintersting way. The film has a good Soundtrack and some good Action Scenes. Its a fun movie. Not a masterpiece but something nice to pass the time with .

Predictable,"The only intresting thing about the movie was Harley Quinn. There were couple of catchy scenes otherwise, it was very predictable. Specifically the fighting scenes were ridiculous and unrealistic. Overall, It seems that this movie was made for 16 years old teenage girls.

Edit: I didn't read the reviews before watching this movie. It seems there is general impression that people who are giving bad ratings are giving it without watching it. I assure you I watched it completely and with open mind. Although I knew it will be a normal politicaly correct Hollywood movie but I wasn't expectIng all the protagonists to be women. Then I saw the director and the writer, I realized why they were all women. Both of them are women. The normal political correctness only applies to male directors and writers.

Middle of the road action cheese,"Birds of Prey (BOP) is a different style of movie to other live-action DC movies. The story is narrated by Harley and has a few on screen graphics that try to add character to the storytelling. However, it feels like it's reaching to be something it doesn't quite achieve. There are obvious comparisons with Deadpool that can be made, but Deadpool has more effective humour. I don't recall laughing or smiling at anything Harley says or does. So, it's not really a comedy.

Is it a good action movie then? I was impressed with Margot Robbie's action scenes, she is probably the best fighter in the movie (which is a sensitive subject for some people), but she's the anti-hero of the movie and we need to suspend disbelief and acknowledge Harley's talent as a brawler. It's only when the Birds of Prey fight together that the fight scenes look more like a rehearsed dance. A fight in the later part of the movie looked like it was a TV fight the likes we'd see on CW's DC productions. So the action is a bit of a mixed bag, but if you love the CW shows, you probably won't have a problem with the action here.

The casting and characterisations were what really let down the movie the most, with Margot Robbie really carrying this movie. Ewan McGregor seemed miscast, he has his boyish grin and was a jerk in the movie, but in no way was he menacing as Black Mask... well maybe for a moment. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is another character that seemed miscast - although I like both her and McGregor in other roles. Her Huntress was awkward, intentionally, but also a bit cringeworthy at times, like her delivery of the line ""I don't have anger issues"" felt forced.

BOP could have been better if it embraced its craziness, or its R rating. I wouldn't 'not' recommend this movie, but it's not for everyone.",5.0,28 February 2023
"What could have been great, turned out meh","The plot was fine but it jumped around too much to get a good narrative. If the director wanted to have it seem like it was told from a scatterbrained psycho, then I can see what she was trying to do, but it doesnt help the flow of the story. Another distraction was the language. It seemed like they added as many Mother Fxxxxers in that they could just to ensure their R rating, but they got to the point it took away from the story. It is like listening to some 12 year old boys trying to be tough when their Mom leaves them alone. The action scenes for the movie were excellent and of course Robbie was excellent. The rest of the cast did well too, but didn't seem to get to develop their characters much.",6.0,4 October 2020

Little enjoyable,"Birds of prey is not good but its kinda fun. The story was quite weak. It was rather a very simple plot. But I didn't care much for the plot as I enjoyed the way how the story was told rather than what was told. I didn't want a very dramatic, emotional, high stake, serious and dark movie but a movie which was playful, vibrant, self-aware and just having fun with the characters and the setting and on that grounds the film delivered. What the film lacked in its narrative, it made up for in its style and action with quirky flashbacks,effective soundtrack and at times breaking the fourth wall. The action sequences were very neatly done,they are quite amazing. I particularly enjoyed the third act,which had a lot of action,majority of which was so very well orchestrated (Not to mention that the cinematography in the climax was the best in the entire film). The jail break scene was a pleasure to look at as it blended style and a show-off of the eye popping colors that filled the screen. Whereas the editing in the film was pretty good,the cut of Quinn sitting on a chair and then transitioning it to ""Diamonds are a girl's best friend"" comes to mind as an example of the sharp editing. This is surely a colorful film. These are some of the many things to enjoy in the movie. Although, the film has its flaws in that the characters are not much developed,an overused plot and of course it's not a great film by any means but it's well-made and pretty solid enough to be entertained throughout it's runtime.",6.0,7 April 2023

"Not Amazing, but does deserve a Chance","It's open season on Harley Quinn when her explosive breakup with the Joker puts a big fat target on her back. Unprotected and on the run, Quinn faces the wrath of narcissistic crime boss Black Mask, his own right-hand man, Victor Zsasz, and every other thug in the city. But things soon even out for Harley when she becomes unexpected allies with three deadly women -- Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya.

Cathy Yan manages to deliver an adrenaline filled, comic-inspired movie to the big screens rather successfully. The film centres around Harley Quinn's breakup with the Joker, which causes her to struggle finding her own identity and independence. The story is told through the eyes of Harley Quinn, which delivers a fun and unique take on the events throughout the movie. Despite a compelling lead performance by Margot Robbie and a good soundtrack, Birds of Prey never manages to grasp onto its true potential due to a mediocre plot and some poorly written supporting characters. The audience is never really convinced to care about most of the supporting characters nearly as much as they should. The film does have a lot of positive factors in it though and is definitively an improvement over Suicide Squad.

The films main highlight would have to be the action, it is possibly the best action in a DC movie to date, especially in the DCEU. The choreography of all of the action scenes is immensely well done. The use of slow-motion and a large variety of different camera angles really gives a fun, comic-inspired take on the action which is something that many films fail to successfully bring to the big screens. The film possesses a great soundtrack and uses it very well, this definitely benefits the movie. The loud and upbeat music during the action scenes gives more life to the fight scenes and makes you want more. Another highlight from the film would have to be the attention to small details throughout the film and the comedy that is attached to it throughout the movie.

Margot Robbie is yet again simply flawless as Harley Quinn, she really makes the role her own and is undoubtedly the best and most entertaining part of the film. She manages to bring a sense of fun and craziness to her morally questioned anti-heroine. Ewan McGregor also manages to deliver a memorable performance as Black Mask, he displays a strong amount of energy in every scene. Chris Messina manages to deliver one of the stronger supporting character performances in the film with his very accurate take on the very sadistic and psychopathic serial killer Victor Szasz. Mary Elizabeth Winstead really fits the role of Huntress and portrayed her really well, but was given minimal screen time and this caused her to not have that much of an effect on the movie or the audience watching it. Jurnee Smollett-Bell (Black Canary), Rosie Perez (Renee Montoya) and Ella Jay Basco (Cassandra Cain) all deliver decent performances, but unfortunately fail to really shine like Margot Robbie or Ewan McGregor.

Overall, Birds of Prey is a movie that people are either going to absolutely love or dislike, either way it is a movie that definitely deserves at least a chance and I would recommend people to watch it. It offers a unique form of storytelling and in a whole it is a unique movie that works really well for the most part. It might not be an amazing blockbuster, but it is a good enjoyable thrill ride that everyone can enjoy.",7.0,15 February 2020
"Disappointing, boring, and borderline SJW","I was excited about it... then I realized it's just another trope, and there was so much 'white man' bashing in the film it left a horrible taste in my mouth. Boring overall, nothing stood out besides the blatant attempt to force an image down our throats.

I went thinking it would be some empowering, fun spin on things, but what I saw was just mediocre writing, if not, sometimes shameful overly 'feminist' propaganda in the movie. Even as a female I found it off-putting and wrong. Altogether just another SJW type of plug into what should be a movie for everyone. Knock it off, Hollywood. Really. I am a 'nonwhite' female and EVEN I am sick of hearing this rhetoric.

The only reason it gets two stars is for the fight scene choreography and what good acting was to be had from them. Ewan McGregor being in anything adds 1 star also.",2.0,9 February 2020
This is a great movie and women supporting women.,Harley Quinn is performed be Margo Robbie who truly transforms herself to the character. She is not given enough credit for what she creates with this character. This is a woman's woman's movie and should be commended for the flawed characters they portray. Give me more of this and this female prowess. Best DC movie since Batman Begins but expect a different approach.,7.0,13 February 2021
Decent watch & nothing as bad as some other reviews,I'd vote this a 6.5. It's a good watch & I quite enjoyed it. It has nothing man hating about it and not is it a chick flick. It's a normal action movie that's worth a watch if you like the DC characters & want a no-brainier.,6.0,12 June 2020
Was it good? No. Was it fun? Sure,"I had a fun time with this, especially considering Suicide Squad is maybe my least favourite film ever. It was fittingly absurd and over the top for the character, the action scenes were actually really cool, the soundtrack was cool and I loved the costuming. I was very glad this was not directed by a man!

It did obviously have some glaring issues. It had the classic ensemble film problem of not having time to develop either the characters or the plot, would've been far better as a Harley movie rather than trying to shoehorn the other characters in for like one scene at the end.

Also while he may be a classic comic villain, choosing a white guy who has a collection of African masks and art who wears a black full face mask when he's in ""villain mode"" was... a choice...

So I'd say it was generally entertaining if you decide not to overanalyse it and refreshing to see a comic book film with a cast of women who aren't continuously sexualised throughout so that's a plus...",6.0,18 March 2021
They ruined so many characters and so much potential,"Just for ruining Renee Montoya and esp Cassandra Cain alone, I hate this movie.

Writing this as I suffer,"I really wanted to like this movie. I really did.

But I don't understand what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish. None of the characters were true to the comics or any other former movie. Were they trying to make Harley Quinn likeable or make her seem old and boring...mixing the 2 extremes wasn't enjoyable to watch. It was the worst portrayal of a comic character since Two-faced in Batman Forever.

Wasn't funny, wasn't relatable. The only part I liked was the sandwich...",1.0,13 December 2021
A DC Classic,Birds of Prey felt like I'm living every moment of the movie inside of Harley Quinn's mind. I really loved the acting of Mary Elizabeth Winstead. It is nice to see a new face like Huntress.,9.0,7 February 2020
Exactly what you want. Action. Crazy. More Action.,"While this is a clearly feminist movie, I - unlike the cellar-dwelling comic book fans all giving this 1/10 - have no problem with that. It was a much less ham-fisted approach to a feminist anti-hero feature than Ocean's 8, and thoroughly entertaining at the same time. It's no masterpiece but it's exactly what you expect turning up to a movie like this.

Margot Robbie is fantastic as Harley Quinn. She's a once in a generation actress who does a great interpretation of the character. That's what movies are. Interpretation.

If anyone is giving this below a 5/10 it's most likely because it didn't live up the the hyper-sexualised wet dream they had reading the comics. Spoiler alert - people don't make those movies because they're gross.",7.0,29 June 2020
Good character but bad script,"The beginning feels promising but in the end I got disappointed and bored. Harley Quinn is a good and cool character and the other ones works okay too. The script and directing is just too weak, or at least the fighting parts makes the better sides of the script loose importance. Too much of long fighting scenes that are very boring, very unrealistic and not in a funny way (= bad). Could have been a good movie if it contained more jokes and at the same time kept it a tiny bit realistic where it is necessary. Now I felt for skipping the fighting parts with fast forward and that just destroyed my impression of the movie as whole.",4.0,21 January 2023
Ignore the bad reviews and go see it for yourself,"This was a fun, enjoyable Sunday afternoon movie. I thought it was funny in the right places and colourful.

I am a Margot Robbie fan and I believe she plays the character perfectly! Ignore the bad reviews and go see this one for yourself. Bacon and egg burgers for the win!",7.0,16 February 2020
"Messy, yet enjoyable cringe fest","I saw this movie back when it came out opening weekend in theatres, but I came out confused as to what I saw and I didn't know how to explain myself to why I didn't enjoy the film as much as I should've. Now that it's on HBOMAX, I gave the film a second watch and all the light bulbs lit up.

What this film truly lacks is execution and giving certain characters an intriguing arc that actually makes you care about them. Three characters come to mind, two of them being the villains. Roman Sionis (Black Mask) and the creepy yet intriguing character Victor Zaz are a few minor grievances. Zaz was an interesting character, but wasn't explored as much as he should have been. He was mainly put in for the fans of the comics who know his character. Black Mask though started off very well. Ewan McGregor is a fantastic actor, but about halfway through the movie the writing team failed to make him feel like a threat and really just let him just be evil for the sake of being evil, which is really pointless and makes the conclusion fairly unflattering. The character with the biggest problem is by far Huntress aka Helena Bertanelli. The writing team really failed her as a character. She worked better as a mute character earlier on, but when it came to her dialogue, it just all fell flat and really didn't make me care for her. She was treated as a bit of a gag and that was just unflattering when the characters tried to tell us, the audience, how bad ass she is. Her character just fell flat the minute she started speaking.

Other characters aside are mostly good to fantastic. The character Dina Lance was done pretty dang well. She had a purpose and did leave some intrigue to those who aren't familiar with her character so later in the movie when her big moment comes to shine, it truly pays off. Renee Montaya is your typical cop from any tv show or movie, but they run with that gag throughout and it just works with her character. I reall just wanted more of her honestly. Now it comes down to Harley Quinn herself, the true star of the film. Margot Robbie truly embodies the character that is Harley Quinn and works with it amazingly! Much better performance than Suicide Squad and even in that film she was the highlight.

Other than the characters, the story itself had promise and a vision. The problem there is that they tried to do too much and make the film too lighthearted at times. That truly made the film feel off balance and kind of confusing. Especially when they start throwing in other side stories to make certain characters relevant. These ideas were good ideas, just executed at the wrong times. A good amount of what happened in the movie honestly should've been planned to be in the sequel. Let's face it, there's gonna be a sequel. What they should've done instead was give us more time to develop the 3 main characters that matter as well as more exposition on Black Mask as a character with his motives to help the plot feel more genuine.

Is there fun to have with this film? Yes. Will everyone like it? No. Does the good outweigh the bad? For me yes, but that's truly based on personal opinion.

If you can't sit down and try to have fun with this movie, then I can promise you that you won't like it that much. Is it worth the watch though? Yes, just go with it and maybe you'll be surprised. Find your own opinion and don't completely rely on what others say",6.0,18 August 2020
Deserve 2 movie,,6.0,25 March 2020
The worst movie in the DCEU,"This feels like the most cliche movie you've ever seen. The overused ""you probably wanna know how we got here"" narration by harley quinn turns this movie in to an unfunny comedy. The biggest issue with the movie however is black mask. I like Ewan Mcgregor but this is the worst casting I've ever seen. Black mask is a dark and cruel character, in this movie he's extremely stupid and he comes off as stubborn and childish. The side characters are also extremely silly and underwhelming. I mean can you even imagime the Ben Affleck Batman in this gotham dealing with these villains. This movie had so much potential, great villain, black canary and a great opportunity to introduce new heroes. Instead this definitely under budget comedy of a movie seals the grave on the DCEU and won't be remembered because barely anyone watched it. This movie could've been so much better. Warner Brothers needs to commit to a tone because this movie single-handedly destroyed the perception of Gotham the most important city in the DCEU.",1.0,9 April 2022
Female empowerment,"Best DC movie I've seen so far. It's funny and not overly depressing. The action sequences are absolutely amazing, I would describe it as the female John Wick. They followed the comics really well to which i greatly appreciate and they made the villian, a proper villain. He was crazy, had a clear motive and all together terrifying. I was almost afraid to talk in the cinema when he was on screen because he presented such a scary aura. I love Margot Robbie and she didn't fail to impress me in this movie! Altogether, the humour and comedy was amazing and the story and fight scenes planned out and executed perfectly!",10.0,9 February 2020
Entertaiment not more,"+ Action + Easy to understand for no dc fans + Funny moments + Good stunts + Margot Robbie + Sound

Conclusion: Why they spend so much time for the birds of prey? Why they dont make a real Harley Quinn movie. The story behind the birds of prey is so boring. Harley dont get the respect from the dc comics. Margot Robbie can easy play the real Harley from the comics when she get the chance.",6.0,5 March 2020

A really good movie,"Many people write about this movie saying it's lacking. I get why they say that but i just want to say that the movie is excellent, the fight scenes in the movie are really well coreographed with snappy movement following the music. I would say that the last third is the best part of the movie and i wish they would focus on that part a little bit more. It's a DC movie and as most newer dc movies it has a excellent soundtrack every song being catchy and every song fits with the tone of the movie. The movie dosn't take itself to serously witch is good because it's a comic book movie and shouldn't take itself to seriously. The ony thing i could wish this movie was is that i wish it was longer, i really liked it and hope that Warner Brothers keep it up. First the joker movie now this? Excellent job guys and gals keep it up!",8.0,7 February 2020
Missed a good opportunity,"The film as a whole was action packed and enjoyable. However, it was a missed opportunity to make a film about female empowerment. The scene when Ewan Mcgregor's character ordered a club goer to stand on a table and publicly take her clothes off because she was laughing at a joke could have easily have been taken out of the film. I think the purpose of this scene was to make you dislike his character but this was already done previously in the film. This made the scene at the end on the pier enjoyable though. Also the ""Birds of prey"" collective was only formed during the ending of the film which meant that the title of the film wasn't really focused on in the film.",6.0,9 February 2020
A colourful mess,"I love Harley Quinn and in suicide squad she was one of my favourite characters but this film struggled from start to finish.

It was a muddled, loud, chaotic mess.

Don't get me wrong, there are some genuinely funny scenes and Ewan McGregor as the bad guy is very reminiscent of Gary Oldman in Leon but it's slow going.

A lot of it feels forced and some of the acting is sub par. Honestly, if you want to see Harley Quinn, watch suicide squad!",4.0,10 July 2022
Could be better,"""Birds of Prey"" is another one of those movies that you feel could have been a lot better than it was. It was OK to a degree, but there is an awful lot of mindless violence ; no wonder the USA is such a manic place! The acting in this movie is far from perfect, and Ewan Mc Gregor is an actor I really like, but I thought his contribution to the film was rather poor.

This movie is for brick heads all they want is action and fight for no reason . Although i am afraid they will find it silly too ... Many action scenes are really exaggerating so much that even for a Hollywood trash movie is really too much and the result becomes really boring ...

Was hopeful it would be a good stream,"With the only good character from Suicide squad and and a top notch addition of Ewan McGregor I was hopeful that I would at least be worth watching on a streaming service.

Then there's the characters, they felt disrespectful to the sources and under developed. The hardest one to watch was probably Montoya who should have been casted differently or at least not portrayed as such weak and one dimensional character.

Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn,"Director: Cathy Yan

Starring: Margot Robbie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Rosie Perez, Ella Jay Basco, Chris Messina and Ewan McGregor

BIRDS OF PREY is a bright and insane world. While it took a bit for this viewer to appreciate the grandiose display of exaggerated violence intermixed with a bit of reality, it became harder and harder to resist as its less than two hour run time went on. Once you get used to the hyper stylized storytelling and direction, you'll find much to enjoy here.

Robbie is a wonder as Harley Quinn, and she manages to bring a glorious sense of fun to her morally questionable and selfish anti-hero. While the violence doesn't necessarily seem like it deserves an R-rating , aside from a scene or two , the energy that Director: Cathy Yan creates manages to make this all work in the end. It's certainly not perfect, but with a ton of bright spots - including an ode to Marilyn Monroe.

Self-aware, in your face and refusing to apologise for it, D.C., and Harley herself, have hit another home run. The birds of prey and girl power are alive and viciously kicking. 8/10",8.0,6 February 2020
Find something better to watch,"This film answers the question of what would happen if the producers of Disney Channel comedy-adventure films were told to add cuss words and lots of punchy-fighty scenes to their work. Everything is generic about this film - soundtrack, incessant unstylized standard fight scenes, flat soundstage cinematography, dull voiceover narration, costumes from a thrift store. It is not fun, edgy, artistic, innovative, gory, exciting... No psychology, no drama, no jeopardy. What a waste of an opportunity to explore a character from a radical feminist graphic novel perspective.

Don't bother.",3.0,23 August 2020
Woke but Oke,"This is like the most woke movie I have ever seen. No, there are no men being replaced by women here, no there are not outright downgrading of men here, but simply that all men are depicted as...business like toward women. Even the nicest men Harley knows end up doing something that can be seen as not nice toward her.

The story just flows smoothly. The cut are tight and the storytelling is quite entertaining with interesting way to use flashback. The characters are delivered with best performance possible by the actors. Highlights are Rosie Perez's Montoya and Chris Messina's Zsasz. Well, of course Margot Robbie's Quinn is delivered as crazy beautiful girl, and Ewan Mc Gregor's Black Mask is delivered as sadistic flamboyant with great performances, but Montoya and Zsasz are delivered here naturally. Well, as natural as stressed out, underrated smart detective and slice-happy psychopat as possible.

Mary-Elisabeth Winstead's Huntress unfortunately is barely in the movie, but when she appears, she's just great. A bit of socially awkward crossbow toting assasin, Black Widow if she's not selling her sexiness if you will.

Jurnee Smollet-Bell's Black Canary is so on point. She sings, she kicks, and she screams, and her lineage is taken straight out of comic book too.

Disappointing,"I really did not enjoy this movie and I wanted to so bad. However, it was dragged on a little too long, characters were not fully developed and the parts that were supposed to be funny fell flat. I also thought the young asian girl (being asian myself and love seeing asian representation, I don't say this lightly) was just not skilled enough in acting yet to hold her own in this movie. Most of the scenes with her didn't feel realistic enough and reminded me that I was watching a movie rather then helping me get immersed in the story with believable acting. I think in time she would be a great actress. A lot of scenes where Margot Robbie would talk directly to the audience gave me Deadpool vibes, but did not come close to the humor. By the end, I was waiting for the movie to be over. DC movies continue to disappoint me.

Also, this has no impact on the actual movie, but can we talk about how Ewan McGregor and the actress who plays huntress met on another set and he basically left his wife of 20 years for her. Didn't sit well with me seeing them both in this movie, but that's just my own personal opinion. I personally avoid watching certain actors if I don't agree with their life choices, but of course that doesn't go for everyone.",1.0,5 March 2020

A Harlequin's Nothing Without a Master...,"Eh...this drek made the predictable mistake of assuming that a marvelous actor who made a secondary character shine could launch that success into the character carrying a movie by itself. They forgot that moderation was the key to Harley Quinn's success in both Suicide Squad films. Even James Gunn pushed it a little too far in my opinion, but that was a little more understandable considering the B Squad of characters he was working with in the second installment. I don't really know what the plot was about and it didn't really matter anyway. They just cobbled together a bunch of loud and obnoxious nonsense. It wants so desperately to be funny but manages to fall short in every conceivable way...including the cartoonish graphic violence which failed to make me laugh where the aforementioned Suicide Quad succeeded .The only bright spot in the whole mess was Mary Elizabeth Winstead who managed to muster enough dry wit to cobble together a few laughs from me. Though, I do wish she and her husband hadn't decided to slum on this. They are both way too talented to be caught up in this trash. Other than that, the cartoon beginning and soundtrack are what remain for us to cling to. I love Margot Robbie, but your time would be much better served watching her unhinged character in Babylon.

Preying we get a sequel :),"Having been a fan of the comics and the TV show that came out in 2002. I was surprised and excited that the Birds of Prey we're getting a movie. The movie is a wild ride. I'll start out with that. This is 100% not for children, so be advised. Harley is the main character and I feel like this is as close to a solo film as we are going to get. Margot Robbie is better than ever as Harley Quinn. Her comedic timing is perfect and her action scenes are bone crunchingly bad ass! I am a huge fan of Huntress and have been for a long time. I also love Mary Elizabeth Winstead so I knew the character would be done right and it was. Renée Montoya is a wonderful character played by Rosie Perez. Renée is the oldest of the girls and she plays it with ease and with a sense of street smarts as well. She also has a mean punch. Black Canary is played by Jurnee Smollett-Bell and is a runaway stand out. She is sassy and can kick the crap out of anyone. The Black Canary also has the power of sonic scream and that is awesome to see on screen. The girls are best when they are together hands down. The fight scenes are part John wick and part deadpool in the best ways possible. I really loved the fight scenes. They were surprisingly violent. Ewan McGregor was amazing as Black Mask! Needless to say I want to see more of these characters in the future. Fingers crossed that this gets a few sequels.",10.0,8 February 2020
Very disappointing,Had hoped this would be far more enjoyable than it was Margot Robbie did her best but there was a lack of intensity and believability about the character. Ewan McGregor was dreadful and completely unbelievable. The rest of the cast really did not gel well and the was no chemistry between any of them. Would have to say it is in the bottom 3 movies of this genre I have ever seen and likely will be the death knell of these characters for DC. Pitiful.,3.0,7 March 2020

"Everything is bad, except maybe, the fight scenes","Im a fan of comic books, probably thats at leas a 70% of why i hate this, but at the same time, it is a bad movie with a bad script, a confusing style and basic comedy.

First of all i have to talk about comics, and at the same time how they adapted them. Harley quinn herself is well adapted, same happens with black canary (What really surprised me), but all the other characters seem wrong. Why?, well Cassandra cain is a the big answer to that, they made a dark and mute assasin become a random problematic kid that ends up loving harley. Black mask is just a random villain that cant decide if he is just a gay mad villain or a mafia boss, because it seems that he cant be both at the same time. Zsas is just a minion and has 0 development, he is there just to fill a space. Finally Huntress, god i hated how they made Huntress, i love the actress but im sure this character wasnt for her and at the same time the script sucks, all the things huntress says in the movie are completly irrelevant and even her story feels kind of weak.

Now, when talking about the movie itself, begining with the script, it is really basic, the story has been seen 1000 times and thats not the problem, the problem is that it brings nothing new to a story like that, i dont really understand how someone saw this and said YEAH LETS MAKE THIS. At the same time, the style is never clear, as probably most of the things in the movie, it never defines if it wants to be acomedy like deadpool or a serious story, or a parody, or if it wants to be suicide squad 2 (By literally copying the visuals of it)

Finally i have to say that something i find really anoying was how al the time the characters took every chance they have to say how independent and powerful they were, like, go watch a ghibli movie and learn a little about how to make and inspiring independent female character because harley quinn saying im independent and strong every 10 minutes feels ridiculous",1.0,22 March 2020
Margot Robbie a saving grace,"The movie is just some bull bought together in terms of writing of the script. The titular character is pretty much the face saving act. Otherwise, rest of the characters do not have any edge or even add anything to the movie. Really disappointing on Warner to actually screw this up big time.",4.0,23 August 2020
This is a good movie,"Adding my first ever review to offset the vast majority of incredibly unfair and mean-spirited reviews and low ratings. This movie is now my favorite ""chick flick"" replacing Crazy Rich Asians (which was the first such movie that I have ever liked). I did not like Suicide Squad at all and did not think that Margot Robbie's role was either well-written or performed in that one. And I was surprised when this project was announced based on my aforementioned opinion. But to my pleasant surprise, this film is just a whole lot of fun that is more entertaining than the Deadpool movies, especially since Margot Robbie is exponentially more talented than Ryan Reynolds. Birds of Prey should be taken at face value, which is to say that I am not acquainted with the ""Birds of Prey"" from comics or television so I was not making comparisons while watching it. I thought the entire cast was splendid and the four female leads along with the younger girl handled their roles well. I am less concerned about where this film fits into the ""universe"" of DC movies, but it does drop enough familiar references to DC things and includes two heroine superheroes to find a place there. I hope that they make another movie with Margot Robbie playing Harley Quinn because she is much more developed as a character here than in the first film and I think that warrants a return.",9.0,13 March 2020

If you're a Harley fan you will like it,"I loved the movie. That's the first thing I've got to say. I've been a Harley Quinn fan since the 90's cartoons, and I thought Margret Robbie nailed it!! I mean she did an amazing job making this crazy character believable. I love how the movie is all narrated by her. The editing is done in a way where it's just as wild as her mind. She goes back and forth explaining everything to us as she sees it. I also love the Joker, and although I was a bit disappointed he wasn't in it, by the time the movie ended I thought it was better without him. This isn't a movie about him... we already have a ton of movies showing us what the prince of darkness is capable of. I've been waiting for a movie about Harley Quinn forever, and this movie really delivers. I partially think most people are too torn up about the Joker dying (as far as she sees it in her mind) and they aren't willing to watch the movie. It's a fun ride and I highly recommend it if you are a fan of Harley Quinn. For me it was as good if not better than the first Deadpool movie. It's quite similar with the narration, R rating, and over the top action. The only difference is that the other characters think she is crazy since she talks to us as though she is talking to herself, and sometimes forgets who she's talking to. I loved it and already want to watch it again.",9.0,9 February 2020
Birds of Boredom,"If You want to see the good moments from the film, search for a Youtube video where Harley uses the flitter gun. After that You saw everything worth to see here. The films was so dull, that I am wondering now how can I fill the necessary character limit here required for a review.

The setup, which deals a single Harley Quinn, separated from Joker and concentrates on her seems to be promising. ...and that is the point where all the good things stop.

We got a lot of characters from the DC universe, and all of them are boring here. Robbie is usually good as Harley Quinn but sometimes ""over-acts"" her role, plus the makeup and dresses are unnessary extreme. Ewan McGrgeor a great actor but here the script does not allow him to show his talent. Not to mention that his role, the Black Mask should wear his mask.... all the other characters are forgettable.

A lot of reviewers complaining about shaming men by empowered women - actually, the film is sooo bad, that I even failed to notice that, despite I am a man. Probably because I was too bored.

Actually, after a week it is hard to remeber what was the film about.

Probably the flitter gun used by Harley was the only good idea.",3.0,2 January 2024

The trailers for this film really, REALLY don't do this film justice!!

BoP is by far, the most satisfying first-watch of DC movies, next to BvS (My #1 of all time). Like BvS, I really can't understand where all the hate for this is coming from?!

BoP's like a mash-up of ""Crank"", ""Death Proof"", ""Sucker Punch"", ""Deadpool 2"", ""Suicide Squad"" (It has that Snyder/Ayer aesthetic to it- nice little references to Suicide Squad, btw), and Walter Hill's ""The Warriors"", without feeling derivative of either or any!

Something just doesn't click right.,"The movie was surely beautiful, had great acting, costumes, humour and that was all.

So where exactly did it go wrong? The script was an entire mess ,I don't even know where to start.

CHARACTERS : Harley was just being Harley, props to Margot Robbie. Surprisingly, the rest of the birds of prey were interesting characters as well, but they hardly got enough screen time. Roman Sionis was... I have no idea what he was supposed to do. A women hating sadist, that's all his character is. Nothing more. Victor Zsasz even more useless than Sionis. All he did was laugh in a creepy weird way, nothing else on the table. The guy probably had like 5 lines of dialogue.

My main problem with this movie is that it says all men are bad, i mean there isn't a single male character that is just normal. The plot was really simple, and the movie took a lazy style of narration, which is my next problem. NARRATION : 3/4th of the plot was explained by Harley to the audience, she apparently knows what's happening in the scenes that don't even involve her. DC audience aren't dumb enough to have the plot spoon fed. And the worst part is, it was force fed.

This begs the question of why the movie was ever made in the first place. DC took their sweet time to come up with this? The Joker and Harley Quinn breaking up, taking place offscreen. Personally it felt like reading a fan fiction in an alternate timeline where Gotham is all glitter , sprinkles, Night clubs and horrible horrible men.

I gotta admit though, the fight scenes and the humour were great!",5.0,20 March 2020

Two Thumbs Down .,"When the trailer came out, it seemed that was it: nothing looked more promising that this...yet all looked suspect and psychedelic. Giving it the benefit of the doubt, being a comic book guy and all, my assumptions were right.......It is nearly two hours of awfulness you surely could spare yourself from.

Where to start, that is tough. First of all, Quinn is annoying and unoriginal. Her lines are stale and it felt watching a 60s sitcom today as you knew what lines were going to come out of her mouth next. Robbie did her best but I had the feeling that she was not really acting but just being obnoxious on screen and if that is how you portray Harley Quinn...please spare me. When it came to the other characters, they were as uninspiring as the lead and no one stood out. They all looked out of place. Nearly all of the actors were poorly chosen for their roles. Rosie as Montoya was like watching your old relative cheerlead. Were we supposed to feel sorry for her or was it a poor attempt at slapping both sides of ageism with support and cynicism? Winstead as Huntress was as flavorless as eating ramen without spices. Jurnee Smollett looked like she was looking for her identity for the whole 2 hours of the movie. Ella Jay Basco as a young Cassandra Cain...oh my where to start with that....wasn't she supposed to be Caucasian????? I know it is a Woke film but I think every ethnicity was very well represented in this flick and they could have been faithful to the future Bat woman's original inception for old times' sake. As for the Black Mask and Ewan Mc Gregor ..wow what a big mess and how mediocre did they make this villain in this movie.

When it came to the rest, the action was like watching a predictable B class movie. Not only it was incredulous, it did not make sense for even a senseless movie. It did not look authentic nor did it propose something groundbreaking. Instead it gave you that Power Rangers type action that you know would satisfy high school girls who never watched tv before and could be amazed by anything ""girl power"". Pile the ungratifying ending and voila, by the end of this flick you are going why oh why did I indulge into this one?????

Overall, this movie was a great miss and if you don't see it, you are surely missing nothing. But, if temptation gets the best of you at some point remember this......don't you have something better to do than to insult your own intelligence with this travesty???",2.0,7 March 2020

The story was fun, plain and simple, and I would absolutely recommend you watch this movie while stuffing your face with candy on a saturday night. The action wasn't really top notch until that last fight, I loved the roller skates. One review said this movie was ugly, but I have to disagree.

I like Harley Quinn... but I don't like this movie,"First let me say this, even though suicide squad's story telling kinda sucked and so is Cara Delevingne's acting, I was able to find the movie enjoyable from an entertaining perspective. I did not want to believe the Birds of Prey is as bad as people say.

I just watched half of it on HBO Max and I decided to just turned it off and maybe finish it later when I'm mentally ready, it's that bad.

Ok... it has it's moments here and there, and I like Margot Robbie, and there are some interesting fighting scenes. However, the story is just very empty, comic inspired movies doesn't have to be bad! Look at Deadpool and most of the Marvel movies...

It's hard to engage with the characters

The acting is not good

The story telling is strange but predictable

The action is slow most of the time and just look rehearsed that you'll see the bad guy #1 just fake being busy waiting on the side until bad guy #2 falls on the ground so he can then jump on Harley Quinn... it was painful to watch that.

As an asian woman, I really want to support a young asian female director and the majority female cast... but this is so beyond disappointing to me sadly.

This movie was trash..boring..what a letdown,I came in thinking this cannot be worse than Suicide Squad but it proved me wrong. Who wrote this nonsense ?? It was a wanna be Deadpool John Wick hybrid and it failed on every single level. Margot Robbie was great but there is only so much you can do with this cringey dialogue.,1.0,7 February 2020
Fun and filled to the brim with personality,"From Margot's performance, to the visuals, to the fight scenes and to the soundtrack, this movie is such an enjoyable experience. You can tell how much Margot loves this character and how much effort she went through to do her character justice. She's the perfect Harley and nails the personality traits that made her original character from the Batman animated series special, which was lost to most of her other adaptations where they made her into an oversexualized yandere stereotype. And I think the two brief emotional moments where she tears up were very effective at making the audience feel for Harley. I also adore her voice and her Harley laugh. This movie is also visually and musically stunning. I adore how colorful everything is while still mantaining its aesthetic. The fight scenes are so engaging and well coreographed, I genuinely enjoyed watching Harley move. Of course theyre not perfect given that in some moments that thing where the bad guys kind of stand still and wait their turn while the protagonists is beating another bad guy instead of everyone attacking the protagonist at once happened but then again i dont think ive ever seen a fight scene that involved one character vs multiple ones that DIDNT do that, so im not gonna hold it against it. The original soundtrack is also a delight, my personal favorites are Diamonds, Experiment on me, Sway with me and Doja Cat's song (even though it was only in it for a split second). I think the only valid criticism I've seen towards this movie that isnt just whiny misogynsitic triggered males going ""wahh wamen bad, im opressed because a woman made a movie starring women!! reverse sexism is real😢 gender politics!!😫"" is that this is very much a Harley-centric movie and theres not much about the actual Birds of Prey in it. I respect and agree with Margot's decision of making Harley interact with other characters and making it a fun girl gang movie, but I think it would've been a much better choice to make Harley's sidekicks Catwoman and Poison Ivy and naming it Gotham City Sirens. Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie where Margot shines as Harley more than ever. The humor is great and its one of those movies where you get to watch a quirky character get herself in and out of trouble while seeing the world through her eyes. Both Cathy Yan and Margot did an amazing job and I hope the progress this movie did with its portrayal of Harley doesnt get completely set back with the upcoming Suicide Squad reboot.",10.0,23 August 2020
if you thought suicide squad was bad then avert your eyes from this absolute malarkey.,Listen I thought suicide squad was absolutely a huge misfire but just wait till you lay your eyes upon this travesty. Once again we bear witness to easily one of the worst actresses around in Margot Robbie playing easily the most annoying portrayal of a comic book character once again. They somehow managed to make this into a feminist film which is not surprising and they dance on any true accuracy of being faithful to the subject matter. Ewan McGregor is maybe the one saving grace as black mask but even his character is misrepresented in this mess of a film. This will no doubt be a box office bomb and looked at is even worse than suicide squad if you can imagine that.,1.0,5 February 2020

I like Margot Robbie and I know she was heavily involved in this movie. It's a shame, because it's not very good. Most of the humour didn't hit the mark. We are asked to believe that a supposedly highly intelligent person becomes a kookie super hero/villain because she broke up with her boyfriend. So of course when one goes out on their own they buy a hyena for company! One minute she's ditsy, the next she is making a profound psychiatric diagnosis. Ding-a-ling-a-ling! The baddie Roman was a cutout villain with no depth & no back story about how he ended up a villain. He was like a child who lost his favourite toy & having a tantrum. There's a song & dance routine thrown into the mix when Harley nearly got knocked out that was superfluous, making no sense.

Moreover, it was not in any way, shape or form better than Suicide Squad, let alone Joker. The plot was a joke. The only redeeming factor was the few adrenaline rush moments.",5.0,8 February 2020
the people who rate it 10 or 1 are liars... it's a HARD 3.,"To say Birds Of Prey is the worst movie in the DCU (slightly worse than Shazam, Green Lantern & Suicide Squad NOT as bad as Catwoman.) is not reflecting that the movie while flawed was quite entertaining at times.

But THAT being said it was clearly 3/10, & the people who rate it 10 or 1 are liars, delusional or JUST flat out haven't even seen it.

Margot Robbie as always is great, but the character, just like in Suicide Squad is BEST in moderation & AMAZING when used sparingly & occasionally.

The writing was very poor, & action inconsistent.

The swearing & graphic violence were completely unnecessary. Like 2019's Hellboy, the R rating was a HUGE MISTAKE.

The action went from Power Rangers kids afternoon TV slapstick, to broken bones really strangely. Harley has never been an R-rated character, but I guess they wanted to pull 'Logan, Deadpool' money which I kind of doubt they will with how ridiculous the SJW, Neo-Feminism & misandry was (all villains are white men, slow, mean, stupid, rapists...).

Canary, Huntress, Batgirl, Zsasz & Black Mask were unrecognizable & really weak pale versions of their interesting & exciting comic counterparts & Montoyas casting & character was a REALLY bad fit. Rosie Perez looked uncomfortable the whole movie, & her 55 year old cop character joining a team of super heroes was stupid & made no sense.

Costuming design was bad, casting was terrible.

Ewan Macgregor should not have accepted this after reading how cringe his role & the story was.

Expected so much better,"Okay, so this movie has me conflicted. The first Suicide Squad movie, Harley Quinn totally stole the show and when I learned she was getting her own movie, I was so excited. But then I saw it and I really don't know what to think. Where was the Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad?

See, in Suicide Squad she was written one was as far as what she said went. And though Margot Robbie was able to keep her speaking the same way (accent-wise) it wasn't the same syntax-wise. When you don't have the same material, no matter how hard the actor can try, it just doesn't sound like the same character.

Yes, Harley still does her morally ambiguous antics that are hilarious and interesting. But there was just something missing. I can't put my finger on what, but something that made her funny and playful in the first movie, some extra spark, was missing in this one.

Maybe it was the costuming/styling. In the first movie, Margot Robbie looked incredibly beautiful. But in this one, the makeup was wonky and really made her unattractive. The lipstick was the wrong hue for her, same for the foundation/powder. And her hair, which had been thick, is suddenly thin and sparse. They had her a 10 in the first movie and maybe a 7 or 8 in this one.

The birds of prey women, though mostly gorgeous and talented, all felt really contrived. I saw the acting, trying to be these tough girls, which pulled me out of the story because if I see the acting, then I remember it's a movie. This may not have been their fault since I noticed this with Harley as well (which wasn't apparent in the first SS). It very well could have been the direction, especially since I noticed it with all of them. Maybe the director wanted them to all act terribly and be too over-the-top and whatnot. Stuff that usually would have worked for Harley but just somehow didn't. Even Ewan McGregor as the Black Mask did this, and we all know he can act when he wants to. So I've tried to not blame it on the actors and instead on the writing and directing.

Of course, that all being said, I did still enjoy it. I just had to stop having pre-conceived notions about what it is and isn't and try only to see the fun in it. Then it's the good time it was meant to be.",8.0,19 January 2022

Birds of Prey: Oh it's a not so fantabulous solo flick of Harley Quinn,"Birds of Prey ... or is it 'Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey' now? The Harley Quinn movie? Yeah that works.

Directed by Cathy Yan and starring Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor, it's ... not good. Now this is just an opinion. Not a fact. Some people liked this movie, some people didn't and most weren't bothered to watch it (evidently so).

Cathy Yan did her best in directing the movie, it's not exactly a flaw there's nothing wrong with it. I suppose the good parts are Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor's performances. I will say, Black Mask/Roman Sionis was actually very well done. Possibly the best part of the movie (in my opinion).

Other than that, there isn't much to say about positive aspects of the film. The writing was rather thin and dull. Most of the dialogue (other than some from Sionis) was disappointingly poor. A handful of the jokes landed, but the rest were honestly just throwaways. The plot was simple (not bad) but it was just dragged on and on throughout the movie and you eventually just want to get to the point.

The first act was also rather slow and somewhat pointless. There wasn't much that contributed to the actual plot of the movie. Yes, they introduced all of the main characters in that bit of the movie. But even that was rather rushed. There are also some flashback sequences in the first act in attempt to weave all the character's narratives together but it was just messy and honestly disappointing. Throughout the entire first act, I felt that the movie was still trying to figure out exactly what kind of movie it really wanted to be before starting the second act. And that says a few things about the writing.

Another aspect that disappointed was the action sequences. They were just not immersive or exciting (except for the 'big one' in the third act, some of that was alright). Most of them were somehow quite repetitive, if not boring. And having a slow-motion shot every now and then doesn't cut it.

Finally, the rest of the characters. Oh, what a waste. Other than Harley and Roman, none of them have any sense of connection whatsoever. They're basically just there because the writing says so. They were just shallow and forgettable. The movie did attempt to add some substance to them with backstories and flashbacks, but there's no point in showing who they are if you don't get to know them at all.

But then again, some people did enjoy this movie. Maybe others are taking it too seriously. Who's to say?",4.0,16 February 2020
Not as bad as the incel reviews will tell you.,"I'm only giving it a 10 to counteract the 1 and 2 star ratings done by sad pathetic men. It's a solid 6.5 movie.

Only thing I would like is if Huntress was more fleshed out as a character and the broken up timeline in the beginning was a little gimmicky for my taste.

"some potential, mostly disappointing","Birds of Prey is alright. It is functional in its technical aspects, has enough energy to be entertaining and has some legitimately great action choreography that is well shot. Unfortunately, the story is tired, the characters are underdeveloped, the thematic messaging weak and the tone muddled.

The once untouchable Harley Quinn now has a target on her back after breaking up with The Joker. The story is narrated non-linearly by Harley which helps to keep the pace moving along and distracts the audience from the over done story that basically boils down to, get the thing before the bad guys. As is often the case with narration in film it adds very little to the movie, for the most part telling the audience information which we could already figure out for ourselves. This might be excusable in a film like Deadpool where the fourth wall breaking, self-aware nature is a part of the character or in a children's film. But here it is unnecessary and feels like the filmmakers are talking down to the audience, not trusting them to pay attention.

The production design and costuming are a stylised evolution of the garish glitter puke aesthetic of Suicide Squad with noticeably better lighting and overall execution. The music also improves upon Suicide Squad, there is still an abundance of pop songs but here they feel more fitting and less like a brash music video compilation. What elevates Birds of Prey above the schlock is the hand to hand fight choreography. The stunts, rhythm, creativity, and interesting choice of locations for the fights are all well executed in mostly long takes and wide shots giving the audience a good sense of visual continuity and special awareness, showing off what is some of the best action seen in a comic book movie.

Despite some rather awkward dialogue and a lack of depth to any of the characters the performances in the film are all serviceable. Margot Robbie turns in a consistent performance as Harley Quinn and tries to add some much needed relatability to the character, but Harley remains quite unlikeable making it hard to empathise with her and stifling much of the film's attempts to draw out an emotional response from the viewer. Non-committal in tone shifting jarringly from scenes of comedy to disturbing drama the film lacks a sense of clear direction. This lack of commitment is also present in the movie's themes. At first it seems to be about Harley finding individual strength and independence then as the Birds of Prey are introduced the theme shifts its focus to the importance of overcoming differences and embracing teamwork. Meanwhile the story also touches on abuse and the victimisation of women. Any of these themes could have been developed to convey an interesting or important message but the ideas are spread too thin and don't work together so ultimately the film doesn't really have anything to say.

Birds of Prey is an improvement on the likes of BvS, Suicide Squad, Justice League and Aquaman, it is competently made with some sense of style and has impressive action but it falls flat with a weak script and a lack of clear direction making for a disappointing missed opportunity.",4.0,19 February 2020

A Complete Blast,"I wasn't really sure what to expect not having seen Suicide Squad or really knowing anything about the other characters other than a vague remembrance of an episode from a TV show on The WB about a decade ago, but this was a fun fun movie. I was especially impressed with Harley's flippant fighting style.

Ewan McGregor was ""the cruelty is the point"" incarnate as was his instigating sidekick villain,Zsasz, played by Chris Messina. And I really wouldn't mind a sequel for the actual Birds of Prey crime fighting trio sans Miss Quinn either.",9.0,7 February 2020
Worst I've seen in years,This movie has no redeeming qualities. It would be entirely forgettable if not for being so bad. I'll always remember that about it. DC is dead to me now.,1.0,18 May 2020
Hits Strong with the Intended Audience,"Birds of Prey is not trying to do what most MCU movies do and reach a broad audience. It's aimed at women who have been beaten down in life, whether by men in power, societal pressures, poverty, etc. To someone who hasn't experienced those things, characters may seem underdeveloped. But I didn't find this to be the case. The movie uses quite a bit of shorthand that many women will understand so that it doesn't need to spend too long on the backstories of five different women, and can instead jump into creating a dynamic between them. My favorite interactions were those between Harley and Cassandra, and those between Harley and Dinah.

That's not to say this is a perfect film. The first 20-30 minutes jump around in multiple different time-frames, and can be difficult to follow. Once it gets rolling in a chronological structure, this problem disappears, and it becomes a well-paced wild ride. Secondly, many people have pointed out that the movie focuses much more on Harley than it does on the Birds of Prey. This is 100% true. If you're coming to see a Harley Quinn movie (which to be fair, is largely how it was marketed) you will be very satisfied. If you wanted more of a Birds of Prey movie, you may be disappointed. Finally, I'm not well-versed in the comic book lore behind most of these characters, but as I understand it the movie takes a lot of liberties with them, and their movie counterparts are essentially different people. This could upset fans of the books who were hoping to see these characters represented on-screen.

However, if you're willing to look past these things (as I was) and you pick up on a lot of the subtext and implications, this is an incredible movie. In addition, the cinematography makes it a treat to the eyes. You could pause on almost any moment and have a great picture for your desktop. Finally, the action is fantastically choreographed, shot well, and the lighting makes it easy to see what's going on.

I highly recommend this movie.",9.0,9 February 2020

A fun slog,"If you disliked the long character introductions in Suicide Squad then this will irk you just as well since much of the beginning is plagued by constant backtracking for character expositions. Eventually things pick up, with some awesome fight scenes for the violence we all came for. But then the slog continues as most of the characters are just plain uninteresting. Roman, Canary, Zsasz, Cassandra - all bring little to the table and aren't enticing when being the main focus.

Humor is all over the place, ranging from well-placed to ""let's just have Harley say something here to show quirkiness"" which can be off-putting or cringey.

Personally, I'm not a fan of kid characters in adult movies. They show things down with constant babysitting, get in the way of potentially great moments, and are just overall unnecessary characters. This and Deadpool 2 are no different, and Cassandra could've be written out. This would have been better themed with Harley trying to pull off a big heist to show off her independent chops instead of the tiresome ""become a foster mother to this woeful child"" trope.",5.0,8 February 2020

I did this weird thing...I made up my mind AFTER watching the movie,"Don't listen to the trolls or fanboys who made up their minds about this movie months ago. Go see it yourself and make up your own mind! Having said that...

I really enjoyed this movie. I thought that the action in this movie was executed very well and the color palette was used to its full potential. I love that DC is shifting away from trying to be a carbon copy of the MCU and is now focused on being the alternative. Hard R. Villain-centric. Letting their directors put their own stamp on every movie.

Margot Robbie cements herself as the Harley Quinn of this generation. She's funny, vicious and walks the anti-hero line with grace. Ewen McGregor chews up every scene that he's in. A pure adaptation of Black Mask? Nah. An entertaining take on the character? You betcha. The cast top to bottom is great and I hope we get the chance for a follow-up in the future.

Some of the storytelling is messy. There's an abundance of narration that sometimes works but other times feels like a shot of nitro to revealing exposition. The timeline jumps around a bit but telling this story linearly would take away its iniquity and make it feel like every other comic book movie.

Don't go in looking for any deep messages. It's more upbeat, with a few serious scenes that really establish the threat. Warning, there is a scene with sexual harassment that was very jarring, and it's definitely a rated R film in regards to the swearing and violence. Personally, I left the theater wanting more, immediately planning to watch it again in a day or two and I convinced a few friends to come with me. The music is really outstanding. It's about as absolutely crazy as you'd expect from a story told from Harley Quinn's POV.

The acting is phenomenal, the action scenes are freaking fantastic, and I'm excitedly awaiting the next time I get to see Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. She was made for the role!

After a stressful first month of the year, this movie was exactly what I needed to shrug off the bad, and get ready to fight whatever life throws at me. A must-see film, even if you don't typically watch superhero stuff!",10.0,7 February 2020

"Better than Suicide Squad, which indicates how bad it really was","I didn't like this movie and I didn't hate it. I felt it was serviceable but that it could have been better with a more competent director and writer. They wanted a female to direct and write, but were these people really the best for the job? It doesn't help when your lead actress acts like she would rather be somewhere else. They have got to recast Margot Robbie. She is beyond awful as an actress. She's either not motivated or the director isn't pushing her enough.

What happened to the people who did those amazing Suicide Squad movies? What happened to the person who made the trailer for the first Suicide Squad movie? They did a better job capturing Harley Quinn than two horrible directors ever could. It's pretty bad when some animated film that went straight-to-DVD beats the pants off the big-budget live-action movies I just got eighties and nineties vibes from this movie of an era prior to Marvel where Hollywood just bought the rights to a comic book superhero or videogame character just to make a quick buck. I haven't seen fight scenes this terrible since the nineties. I used to do Tae Kwon Do and it kind of hurt to see female characters using moves that would get them destroyed because of their light weight. Nothing was ever established too that these characters are enhanced in any way.

For starters, Harley Quinn is and always will be a supporting character. She's not a ""strong, independent woman."" Harley even states this in the movie, defining what a harlequin is. You can't make her a leading lady. It doesn't help when the actress playing her is clearly not committed to pushing the envelope with the role. I also do not like the outfit, it's another callback to the terrible low-effort nineties adaptations.

Mary Elizabeth-Winstead is just horrible. The Huntress character is just awful to begin with. What trained, efficient killer uses a crossbow? Seriously. Nothing was even done to give the impression this crossbow was special or that Huntress should be feared. She's even more apathetic in the role than Margot, giving the bare minimum of effort in terms of acting. I can see why her career never took off. There's a lot of potential there with her, but she doesn't want to be an actress. Why still take the jobs then?

Jussie Smollett's sister, Rosie Perez, Ewan MacGregor and the actor who played Victor are pretty much the only actors who made any effort in this entire movie. This could have been a lot better, it's just a shame. There are some other elements I noticed that bugged me, but it's not PC so I don't want to be censored. It has to do with things the director pushed in because of her heritage, including many unlikable actors that rubbed me the wrong way and elements that would get any other director or writer called a racist.

I would wait for DVD. I got my ticket free but want my time back, sorry. Might be time to reboot and recast, that's all.",5.0,9 February 2020
Excellent,"This movie was a perfect fit for the character of Harley Quinn. It doesn't take itself too seriously, it's fun, bubblegum and violent and was clearly made by people who love the source material.

Super movies try too hard to be gritty and realistic nowadays but the tone, humour and the way Gotham was portrayed makes the universe feel more three dimensional than most batman adaptations. I always asked myself why people continued to live in Gotham with all the crime and villainy happening but this actually seemed like a real place and showed that just because it's crime ridden doesn't mean everything has to be grey and depressing all the time.

Perfect casting. Especially Robbie, who you can feel absolutely adores Quinn. McGregor is unexpected and funny and I enjoyed the parallels of his character and Messina's Zsasz to the Joker and Harley.

Clothing and set design were so fashionable and non... Halloween costume feeling. They felt true to Harley whilst being modern and fun.

I genuinely do not understand the bad reviews for this",10.0,20 February 2020
What a cluster.,"Only McGregor and Robbie come out of this looking okay.

I seriously was enjoying the first 20-25 minutes of the movie. Then the storyline started and all the other characters started to be introduced and the movie totally nose dived.

I can see people praising the movie as being a mile a minute entertainment and how it went straight into the action and pulls you along with a crazy storyline. I disagree, the movie has long stretches of nothing, repeated scenes of long drawn out flash back sequences to stuff we can easily guess or are just there because they're trying desperately to squeeze in the backstory for 4 new characters.

I found it a very boring movie. Most of the fight scenes are pretty bad and it's not hard to very quickly notice something a lot of people had an issue with. Whilst a lot of people don't like ""woke"" movies, which this definitely is, this movie actively seems to hate men. There isn't a single ""good"" man in the entire movie. The one man introduced as an angel, as the good example of a man...quickly betrays Harley out of no where.

Every villain is a man. Every goon is a man. There are plenty of female cops...but when they invade a police station, all those female cops vanish so it's all male cops being beaten up. There is a single ""evil woman"" who is a crazy woman who appears for 2 seconds and blows up off screen. They really try and imply Black Mask hates women because...well, I don't know. Harley just said he hates anyone with a vagina even though it's suggested he is gay and his most trusted aide is a woman and when murdering a group of people he lets the little girl live (before changing his mind when she blows snot at him).

Also, because every fight is against men when the Birds of Prey consist of 4 women, 1 of which is in her 60s from looking at her and is 4'8"" and the other three all weigh 90lbs each, the fights are terrible for the most part. Where Terminator Dark Fate hired a woman who seems like she's about 6 foot tall and reasonably fit, this movie didn't even try.

Cassandra who is the 10 year old maguffin for this movie is the worst character. She's one step away from screaming about white privilege and the patriarchy with every line.

The movie is sexist which would've scored badly in itself because, well, I'm a dude and when the entire movie seems to hate me I'm not going to enjoy it, but mixed with how boring it was, how none of the characters were even close to likeable, how it just wasn't really funny most of the time, I can't score it higher than a 2.",2.0,23 June 2022
Unexpectedly good,"I went in with low expectations but ultimately I was really entertained by this. I agree that the film is akin to a female version of Deadpool.

A Dodo of a film. Extinct and flightless.,"God only knows how this managed to get to screen. I really was looking forward to watching this as Suicide Squad had been a pretty decent film. The same cannot be said for this utter nonsense with a character who clearly is not strong enough to fill 109 minutes. 109 minutes I may add that I'll never get back.

Birds of Prey shall fly, into a bin right where it belongs.",1.0,14 February 2021
"Female Deadpool with Worse Story, Poor Acting, and Unlikable Protagonist.","Due to COVID-19, most of the movies that were scheduled to come out this year were pushed to 2021. Birds of Prey was one of the few movies that managed to come out before lock down. However, it was still a massive flop, and I can't say I'm mad. It's a shame that out of all the superhero movies that were to come out this year, Birds of Prey was the only one that got released. From the trailer itself it looked pretty bad, but I decided to give it a chance anyway. While I don't think it's terrible or worthy of a one star, it was still an absolute waste of time.

One think I noticed about the story is that it has striking similarities to both Deadpool movies. The protagonist is crazy, she breaks the fourth wall, and over the course of the movie becomes (kind of) a hero. There's a kid character who is integral to the plot, there's a generic villain who's evil for no reason. Both movies are also R-rated. Whereas in Deadpool all these things are important to his character, in this movie it feels very out of place.

Harley was never a fourth wall breaking character at all. Granted, she doesn't have much personality in the comics so maybe they wanted to add some more characteristics, but they did it in the laziest way possible, by just making her female Deadpool. I always saw Harley as the annoying sister I never had, or a comedic sidekick. Which is why it doesn't really work when you try to make her the main character of a movie. Maybe a cartoon, or a comic, but definitely not a feature length film. You could argue that this is a team movie, but I disagree.

All the other members of the team are so forgettable and are given such minimal screen time that I struggle to remember their names. They all have a five minute flashback backstory, then they operate on some subplot that is vaguely connected to the main story, and then they all end up in one room by the third act through sheer coincidence. And then they say: 'Well I guess we should work together as a team now.' It feels so contrived and forced.

The villain is no better. Ewan McGregor brings in a decent performance, but his character is lacking. He's just a mustache-twirling villain who gets mad a lot and kills people. Still, I liked him way more than Harley Quinn, so much so that I was actually rooting for him to win. You can tell a main chracter is poorly written if you felt like choking her the entire movie.

The editing gives me a headache. There's one scene in the film when Harley is captured, and the editing is on the level of Suicide Squad (definitely not a compliment). About one third of the film is a flashback sequence, so it's really hard to keep track of what's going on. And it's so unnecessary as well. Half the flashback takes place in a previous place that we have already seen, so why did they have to show the flashback?

As for positives, I suppose the props and set pieces were good. I liked the action quite a lot, especially ones with Harley in them. The movie has an over the top color palette that is actually quite memorable, and there is a certain amount of style to it as well. Margot Robbie gives quite a convincing performance, one that is better than the one she gave in Suicide Squad (everyone else's acting sucked though).

The director of the film, Cathy Yan, says that the movie performed poorly because the world is not ready for an all female cast yet. However, I completely disagree. This movie's poor performance is mostly because of it's R-rating. The only people whom I know that actually like Harley are a bunch of 12-13 year old kids. Aside from a couple of f-bombs and some mild gore, this movie feels very childish. It has no mature themes at all, and the jokes are extremely silly.

The target demographic for this movie is adults, and yet I'm sure this film would make a lot more money if it was just PG-13. I guess they wanted to jump on the R-rated movie bandwagon after the success of Joker, but I'm glad to say it didn't work. Please don't watch this movie, it's a complete waste of your time and money.",3.0,10 July 2020

The ufff action scenes are deserving of Oscars. The great performances, perhaps the biggest problem is the fact that it does not look very much like comics, but I do not see anything wrong with that, since this film is an adaptation, it should not be a calque to the comics.

Marginally better than Suicide squad but worse than Justice League,"OMG! This is a terrible film.

What is it about DC? I honestly don't get how they can get the likes of Christopher Nolan and do terrific films like the Dark Knight trilogies and then come up with absolute crap in the form of:

Suicide Squad
Justice League
Batman and Robin


The three worst films I have even had the privilege of watching (although TBF Marvel has it's turds in the form of Green Lantern and Blade: Trinity - I'm looking at you Ryan Reynolds),

Birds of Prey etc etc is a shambles.

The plot is dire. The villain shockingly bad (probably one of worst acting performances I have ever seen from Ewan McGreggor). The action sequences were done by someone who likes paint by numbers and is still unsure if it's right. The sets....oh dear....and one or two of the CGI (there is a terrible piece of computer generation as Harley takes the kid into a food establishment - done on an iPhone 3GS?).

It's all so amateurish and I am so glad cinema audiences were never subjected to this absolute car crash of a film.

It's really bad.

Dialogue is so cheesy.

I mean you watch this film with friends to laugh at how bad it is. How cliched and hackneyed everything about it is.

Margot Robbie does her best but nothing can redeem this mess.

Whereas Marvel have really thought out story (there are phases to their storytelling for goodness sakes!) and provided funding and found film crews to realise those stories, DC have failed.

DC are just cobbling together scraps to make films.

Their output seems to be for people so bored with their lives they want to watch something even more boring than their own lives.

Which must say something about me.

But, I watch them for the hope of finding a gem and yet unearth crap.

Oh well, watch it if you are drunk, with friends and want to laugh at bad film making. Otherwise, live your boring life and thank me by blinking for 90 minutes.

What the hell is this.,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only thing about Birds of Prey that was worth watching is Margot Robbie, simply for the eye-candy, but unfortunately everything else, including the story and directing of this movie is just plain awful.

The villain is nearly non-existent and the story does not follow the comics at all. The characters are always, CONSTANTLY, trying to be funny and witty, as if this was a Deadpool knockoff. Who at Warner Bros approved of this? Every single scene is a big pile of cheese. What the fuh... you know what, I digress.

The director, writers, and the entire Warner Bros team responsible for this trash need to go back to the source material, comics, animated series, or even reference movies such the Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix 2019 Joker, in order to bring a more serious, darker take on Harley Quinn next time.

Harley Quinn seemed to be more of a broken person in Suicide Squad. She seemed like someone who can psychologically pick your brain and corrupt you, almost like Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. There was potential there. Margot Robbie could have made Harley Quinn simply legendary... unfortunately, the director and writers decided to go the EXTRA SILLY route instead.

Birds of Prey Review,"Birds of Prey is the perfect definition of fun yet still mediocre. It has its own style and stays consistent with it for the most part except for some areas but unfortunately falls into the forgettable yet fun comic book movie. The performances from everyone besides Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor were decent. There wasn't anything special about their performances but they did the best with what they had. Margot Robbie is fun as Harley Quinn. She knows how to make the character work and she is easily the best part of the film. Ewan McGregor is hilariously over the top. He always takes each role he has with as much energy as he possibly can and it was always entertaining to see him on screen. The worst part though is that Margot Robbie is the only character who is developed. Everyone else is just there. They have little to no characterization which reduces their impact to the events of the film. Ewan McGregor's character is evil just to be evil. We don't get a lot of information about why he is evil, he just is. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character has the second most amount of backstory but it feels forced plus I didn't really care that much about any of the supporting characters. An ongoing problem I have been noticing with the films I have seen this year is their respective scripts. Out of the three films I have seen, this has the ""best"" script but it was still pretty weak. Some of the lines of dialogue are very forced and the jokes are inserted in the same forced way. I felt only a small handful of jokes, such as the Harley voted for Bernie joke, were funny while all the others felt forced or just weren't that funny to me. The film's visuals were engaging and interesting. The presentation of the film never felt bland to me. It was always colorful and appeasing. The action is mostly well done. The police station action sequence is pretty awesome but it gets interrupted halfway through by narration which goes into another flashback sequence for about 20-30 minutes. That annoyed me because I was enjoying this badass action sequence and it got interrupted. The film does this at certain points and it can get confusing but I eventually got used to it. Overall, Birds of Prey is a dumb fun comic book movie with fun action and good performances from Ewan McGregor and Margot Robbie but the script and limited to no characterization take away from the experience.",5.0,12 February 2020
Fun and Quirky,"Gave it a 10 to compensate for the low score it doesn't deserve. Otherwise I would give it an 8/9. Amazing fight choreography and visuals that give this movie a lot of personality. I enjoy how the fight scenes aren't just gun fights and are creative and well-thought out. Don't expect anything deep or profound though, this is a simple superhero themed movie at it's base, but with a quirky attitude that is refreshing to see among the superhero movies that take themselves way too seriously. Executing a simple idea well is better than fumbling the execution of a complex one. I thought the main characters were all equally likable and interesting with depth and though the ending was abrupt, I thought it was weirdly fitting for the movie.

Unfortunately we live in a world where an action film starring women is somehow offensive and ""political"" to men. This movie is not feminism, and should not be considered ground-breaking or innovative. It's just that our current standards are way too low. This is just another fun movie based on comic books, and I think there is a lot of heart and charm put into it.",10.0,4 June 2021
You call this a superhero action movie?,"Holy coyote! Except for Margot Robbie, these are the least attractive female actors I've seen in a comic book/superhero movie.

The actions scenes are dull and clearly the actors didn't train for them as extensively as the likes of Halle Berry would in ""John Wick"" or Carrie Ann Moss in ""Matrix"".

The actors don't look like their comic book counterparts at all. It's a huuuge stretch to imagine Ella Jay Basco as the slim and athletic ninja-warrior that Cassandra Cain is supposed to be.",1.0,29 September 2020

I really had fun watching this.,"I enjoyed this a lot. The story wasn't anything new, to be honest, but it was such a fun watch. The dialogues are hilarious, and the bonds that developed between the characters were adorable. I like that it became a team of superhero women, yet it wasn't in your face with the female empowerment. I love the bond that they were able to develop. Also, the action scenes were awesome. It's one of the rare DC movies that I enjoyed. It's much better than the Suicide Squad. I really love Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley Quinn, and all of her costumes.

SHOULD YOU WATCH IT: Yes. It was simple and fun to watch. Just don't have any high expectations. Enjoy it for what it is.

WOULD I WATCH IT AGAIN: I've watched this at least three times now.

Surprisingly entertaining,"I'm over sixty, and generally don't care for characters with no redeeming virtues (my dislike of Watchmen and The Boys is never-ending), so I didn't really expect to connect with Harley Quinn, who is one psychotic charnel house of emotional upheaval. But (surprise surprise) I did -- and found a soft spot within myself for the prickly and over-dramatic Huntress, the hard-drinking cop, and the collaborator-like Black Canary. OK, I even liked the sleazy kid. Like. Not pity (although all of them engendered pity in some way). I liked them. And appreciated the quirky drive of the narrative, and didn't even mind the occasional timeline jumps that took me unawares. The tacky clothing didn't bug me. The black lipstick didn't bug me. The omg over the top accent didn't even bug me. And I was jammin' to the hip-hop hard-driving rap soundtrack, even though I normally dislike rap (hip hop's not terrible. mostly).

Just Fell Flat,,4.0,11 February 2020
Terrifically fun supervillain flick,"Birds of Prey represents an entry in a rather new genre, the female criminal empowerment movie (another example would be Hustlers). For years crime flicks have been men bonding while women flitter around the edges, and I find these new approach interesting.

Margot Robbie is terrific as Harley Quinn, Joker's no-ex girlfriend who discovers that without her beau's protection her psychopathic disregard for others has left her hated and hunted. The movie focuses on her frenetic attempts to survive while mixing with a variety of enemies and a couple of people who, if not allies, are at least neutral.

The other main women Harley interacts with are a determined cop (Rosie Perez), a club singer with some fighting moves (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), and a mysterious character we don't meet until the movie is well underway (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Winstead is wonderful as an insecure badass, and Perez is great as a tough, overlooked cop, but Smollett-Bell's character feels more sketchy; it's unclear why she's chosen this life and whether her occasional moments of concern for women in peril are ongoing or a recent evolution caused by who knows what.

But ultimately this is Robbie's movie, and her funny, crazy performance as well as a bunch of fun action make for a terrific movie.

It's also a movie that seems to have angered a lot of people into giving it 1-star reviews. This is not a 1-star movie, and it's telling that the user review voted most helpful is a diatribe about its ""feminism."" Clearly there's a strong amount of the typical comic-book-boy anger at a woman-centric film, although to be fair some people are saying it's not true to the source familiar (those are the people who knew what Birds of Prey referred to *before* it's explained in the films last 15 minutes) and I can't speak to that.

But still, it's not a 1-star movie. Even Joker, which was pretentious and tedious, isn't a 1-star movie (I gave it a generous 5 out of 10). So all the 1-star reviews are just angry boys out to sink the film; ignore them.

Definitely recommended. Unless you're an angry, woman-hating boy, in which case skip it and watch The Joker instead.",8.0,13 May 2020

"Action packed, fun, and a good time.","Birds of Prey (5 out of 5 stars).

Birds of Prey is an awesome superhero film focusing its story line of Harley Quinn and her coming across other female vigilante's like Black Canary, Huntress, and Renee Montoya. Birds of Prey is like the DCs version of Deadpool. It is fun, it breaks the ground barrier of fourth wall narration from Harley's storytelling, and the action is bloody fun. I did not have any expectations with this movie cause of its poor marketing with the trailers. Making the movie seem boring and annoying with Harley Quinn personality. After watching, I was surprised and I loved it.

The plot does jump around a lot in the movie. It may not make sense in the first half hour of the movie. The film is narrated by Harley Quinn as she explains certain backstories like Huntress or Renee Montoya. And certain events which all leads up to them meeting up. It is a lot of fun with its narrative structure. Harley (Margot Robbie) is torn up about the break up from Joker. But now many bad guys are after her cause Joker is no longer protecting her. Meanwhile, Cassandra (Ella Jay Basco) pickpockets one of Roman/Black Mask (Ewan McGregor) henchman and stole a diamond that is worth a lot to him. Roman decides to put a bounty on Cassandra which Harley tries to protect her from. Which Renee (Rosie Perez), Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and Dinah/ Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) try to help her as well.

The film is a lot of fun. The direction has its own visual and exciting style that never slows down. All thanks to director Cathy Yan. Which she handled scenes very well and did great with the action sequences. The action and fight sequences are entertaining and exciting. There are some gory scenes with Black Mask henchman skinning a guys face off. Got to remember it is an R rated film. Every fight scene is thrilling and worth watching. The climax taking place in a closed down theme park. Really felt like one awesome carnival ride with watching Harley, Dinah, Renee, and Huntress team up. Which kind of sucks cause they only team up in the climax of the movie. And you kind of want more.

The cast ensemble did good with their characters. Margot Robbie is great as Harley. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is great as Huntress and a cross bow assassin with mood swings. Jurnee Smollett-Bell is great as Dinah but she only uses her black canary scream power only once in the movie. Chris Messina playing Roman's bodyguard is creepy. Ella Jay Basco is good playing Cassandra. Ewan McGregor is great as Black Mask. A psychotic and narcissistic villain with a metro personality.

The movie is packed with a lot of action, a fun direction, and the soundtrack was also great with the movie as well.

Overall, Birds of Prey is an awesome film. They story does jump around with its narrative but if you sit back and enjoy the ride of action and humor. It is worth seeing.",10.0,8 February 2020
I'm so disappointed and heartbroken,I was so excited for this movie! I actually enjoyed Suicide Squad and couldn't wait to see Margot become bada$$ Harley again.

What was this trying to be?,The story was recycled and the action sequences were okay with zero laughs. None of the characters here were represented very well.

I might have laughed once or twice, but more because of the absurdity than actual humor. It could have been a nice Girl Power movie, but the girls have no depth. They were all so dull. Whoever decided to go after an R rating for this moving, made a horrible decision. This should have been a fun, action filled comedic, anti-hero movie.

""Emanzipation"" in this Movie literally means that every male character is an complete idiot and/or an a**hole while every female character is the most badass person ever. The plot is a cliché, the first 30ish minuets set up the story and the rest of the plot is 100% predictable and does not surprise even once.

Please, stop believing all the negative comments about the movie, there are always haters trying to discredit good movies for the simple fact that it was not what they wanted.

Never Takes Off.,"Let's get something straight for the record. Birds of Prey, though it serves as a spin-off of the celluloid abortion known as Suicide Squad, is not even close to being as bad as it's predecessor. It's watchable, at least for it's majority. It even has some sort of awareness of how unwanted Suicide Squad is, as it blows off Jared Leto's cringe-inducing Joker rendition by portraying him as an albatross around Harley's neck, and barely a blip on the radar of her own special insanity. As a result, BOP assuredly, though awkwardly, steps out from the rubble as something of its own. Unfortunately for everyone involved, no matter how much they tried to scrub it off, the Suicide Squad stink lingers on. To make matters worse, this film couldn't have premiered at a more inconvenient time. The DC cinematic universe has changed forever with Joker, proving that superhero movies can stir and spellbind the filmgoing public without being flashy and action packed. Joker isn't just good, it's 11 Oscar nominations good. Birds of Prey now just feels irrelevant. Almost as if it was shelved for three years. Hey, it wouldn't have been the first film release of 2020 to feel older (see The New Mutants).

As for the substance, Birds of Prey has something to prove. It wants to be a female Deadpool. It's wants to be cartoonish and whip-smart, but woke. It's struggles to be either. Without a doubt, Margot Robbie is the star of the show. She's a lightening rod, and a badass. She was born to play Harley Quinn. Everyone else is just along for the ride, and it shows. The other female fatales are tragically forgettable. I can't even remember all of their names. Girl power is a group effort, and if you can't do that, than just keep Harley as the sole focus of your movie. Not to mention, every character here, besides Harley, is one-dimensional. Most especially, our villain, Black Mask. He's a misogynistic prick. That's it. No depth, no backstory, none of that. He's a cartoon bad guy. Maybe that was the point. But again, for a film so ""progressive"", it's so stuck in the past. Even as a comedy, it's lopsided. The jokes land, especially when they have to, only to disappear and then reappear unexpectedly. Deadpool worked, because it kept firing jokes at a rapid pace. That's what BOP needed to do. All in all, it's just ok. It really didn't have to be, though. Too bad, puddin!",5.0,9 February 2020

Pretty solid I'd watch a sequel.,"Saw it tonight. It was solid. If Deadpool was amazing from start to finish this is more Deadpool 2. It knew what it wanted to do, but the pacing was lagging at times. There's a part where Harley looks at the audience and does a kind of ""deal with it."" look but it goes on for an extra 5 seconds like ""HEY GET IT? GET IT? YOU SEE WHAT WE DID THERE. LOOK AT WHAT WB LET US DO!"", excuse me, it's not one scene...its..a lot of the movie. That said, its fun. I already had a crush on Mary Elizabeth Winstead circa Scott Pilgrim, but she really nailed it as this fish out of water budding vigilante.

This is a minor praise, but Ive always been kinda irritated with DC pushing the barely dressed sexy clown modern Harley quinn. They really get it in this movie. They completely yanked all that out and she's back to being more of a scary fashion deaf punk clown. Im glad they got the message. We probably have Margot Robbie as EP to thank.

Its also mostly tween friendly. I suspect WB gleefully pursued an R rating hoping it would draw Deadpool money, but its only got a couple mildly gross parts. I only say that because the news is saying parents are avoiding letting their kid fans see it, which sucks. I hope WB makes enough money to keep going with this. I would like to see a sequel.",8.0,8 February 2020

Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn,"After a badass and scintillating turn as the naughty kaleidoscopic vixen Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad.

Margot Robbie gets her own spin off squad. The Birds of Prey but this feels like more of a chaotic Harley Quinn standalone movie with some new members bolted on.

Harley Quinn has been dumped by the Joker and she makes a statement about the split. She blows up the chemical factory that cemented their love.

Without the Joker's protection it is now open season on Harley Quinn. First in line is club owner and ambitious crime boss Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor.) Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) is also hot on her heels.

Roman has lost a Bertinelli diamond which was stolen by pickpocket Cassandra Cain. It gives Harley Quinn a chance to escape from Roman by finding Cassandra Cain and the diamond.

However nightclub singer and the new driver for Roman, Dinah Lance also keeps a watchful eye on Cassandra Cain. Then there is the mysterious Huntress who wants to wreak vengeance.

Directed by Cathy Yan who only has few credits to her name. Her inexperience shows. This is an incoherent noisy and empty spectacle.

It has a zippy beginning but the unreliable narration grates and the film becomes a hot mess as it busily looks for a plot.

The rest of the Birds of Prey are thinly sketched with only Dinah Lance standing out.",5.0,4 December 2020

It was ok,Didn't care too much about psychedelic nature of it all along with all the flashbacks to the point certain scenes were shown twice. From watching the trailers it gave that kind of vibe but it was just too much. It was funny in some parts but overall it was nothing special especially in comparison to these raving critic reviews. It was an okay one time watch. One bright spot was Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress. Would like to see more of her in future movies or even her own movie,5.0,7 February 2020
Could have done with a bit more fun,"This shouldn't have been called Birds of Prey, they hardly feature in this. It is a Harley Quinn movie through and though, unfortunately it's not quite the same one we had in Suicide Squad. In this she is unlikeable with no interesting qualities at all, in fact no one in this is particularly interesting. Black Canary is there, people seem to talk on her behalf more than her actually saying something. Huntress is a joke, Cassandra Cain was actually pretty good but it would have benefitted from being called something else. As there is no connect between her and her comic counterpart, it could have just been an kid. Now I will say Ewan Mcgregor was very entertaining to watch as was the actor who played Zsasz, you could tell they were having fun when making this and chewing up the scenery whilst doing so.

Even though the trailers present this as a bubblegum ride, it's actually quite bleak all the female leads are depressed in some capacity. There are some really boring parts layered though this as well, I think the worst part of this is the fight choreography. Everything just feels so weightless without any force behind it, like you can tell people are pulling their punches. Speaking of which Black Canary can only kick in this, there are lots of opportunities for her to throw a punch or block but instead she gets punched and kicks them after, fantastic. There is a lot of slow motion shots in this as well, which just seem to drag the scenes out.

All in all it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's the worst DCEU movie so far. I'd still rewatch this though, as I like the characters it's nice to see them in live action. You just have to let go of their comic book ties as they share very little with them aside from names, Black Mask was worse than he was in Arkham Orgins but as I said Ewan was fun in the role.",3.0,13 February 2020

Why give a completely unknown director a 100million budget movie?,"Never heard of this director ""Cathy Yan"" before so I checked out her filmography and to my shock, she's only ever made 1 movie (and it was a bad one)... so WHY would you give a director like this 100million dollars? It just doesn't make any sense... 'DC Films' HAD to know that they were making a very stupid decision... Hell, if DC Films gave ME 100million dollars, I can garuantee you that I could have made a better film for them, than this unknown director did.

Example: You know who were the 3 most appealing characters in the Suicide Squad movie? #1. Killer Croc. #2. Joker. #3. Enchantress. And the most hilarious thing is that this movie doesn't feature ANY of those characters... yet despite that fact, the word 'Joker' is probably said over 50 times in this movie... If you're going to mention a character 50 times, but not include them in the movie, then you know you've made a mistake.

This movie is also hilariously unrealistic: In one scene, Harley and a little girl are standing about 2meters away from 3 guys each shooting with submachine guns, and yet somehow Harley and the girl don't get hit by a single bullet... how could that ever be considered realistic?

And in another scene Harley knocks somebody unconscious by throwing a mobile phone against their head... how's it possible? A phone weighs like 200grams, and it's impossible to knock somebody out with just 200grams.

In summary: The movie is scatter brained and the characters are unmemorable, and no matter how Margot tries, the weight of carrying this entire movie on her own is simply too much, and her back gives out from the strain way before the half-way point in this movie...",4.0,23 March 2020

All of the negative reviews are well deserved,"I feel ive been conned since the trailer looked so cool. When I heard this did really badly on the box office I naively bought the dvd thinking it can't be that bad. Boy was I wrong. Had I known that this was produced by Margot Robbie who also starred in it, I wouldn't have bothered because this is always an awful combination. What an earth does Margot Robbie know about producing a film? She's far too young. It was also written by a women, I know the media were claiming that no one wanted to see this because it was written, produced and starred mainly women, but the reality is, and I say this as a women myself, that women just can't write for sh't. It's sexist but it's true. I could have easily mistaken birds of prey for a netflix original because it was so poor, and I get the feeling it'll soon be one of those films available for free on prime. With the idiotic dialog that could have been written by a hyperactive 8 year old, Christina Hodson has brought shame on herself and should never be allowed near a film crew ever again. To top things off this was so dull and miserable, it is saw this at the bottom cinema I would have walked out. It felt very juvenile but at the same time it had gory violence and constant swearing.

Cheesy movie for teenage girls - Comic/Game fans avoid!,"There were people in the theater that got up in the middle of the movie and just left and I don't blame them. We went to watch this movie and we were so bored we just wanted it to end already. First of all, the movie is made for teenage girls and it's all about woman power and beating up men during super loud music making it a complete chick flick. Men are portrayed as such a**holes all the time it gets boring fast. Harley is a badass we get it, but seeing endless waves of men double her size get destroyed so easily, is so unreal it hurts. The movie tries to be serious with some graphic scenes and then it all breaks down when you see ridiculous fights and Harley acting more like an adult who likes to to talk and act like a baby than the Harley we know from comics and games, something a kid would most likely enjoy and not an adult. And there's this misbalance going on about the tone this movie is setting. It's like they added all the ideas of the writers to keep everyone happy and created this mess. Harley is trying to convince us throughout the movie how bad she is as a person without actually being bad or doing anything remotely bad compared to the other villain. The maximum you get is her being mean. It doesn't feel like she is a villain by the way she is acting, but a caring person. Many lines are so cheesy that will make you shake your head. There is a scene which completely loses touch with reality and will make you say ""ok so anything goes in this movie then, got it"" or say ""oh come on!"". If you are a gamer then you will immediately notice how they copied the game pattern of wave of bad guys empty handed, then wave of bad guys with melee weapons then wave of bad guys with guns and then the boss.

PERFECT HARLEY QUINN MOVIE!,"This is the PERFECT Harley Quinn movie. My fanboy dream come true. It felt like a Harley Quinn comic book come to life. Not only that but if you've been watching Harley Quinn's new animated show it was like a live action version of this. Stylish, funny, quirky, witty and of course crazy. Originally when the teaser came out for Birds Of Prey I wasn't as obsessed with Harley Quinn or comics as I used to be and I didn't care as much. Let's just say with each new trailer i slowly got back into Harley and comics and I was very excited for this movie. However through marketing I felt like it's the perfect movie for Harley Quinn stans but disappointing for Birds Of Prey stans. This is because the movie only has 2 actual members of Birds Of Prey members. Harley was never related to Birds Of Prey yet is the main character of this movie. I thought it would be the perfect movie for me as a Harley stan but the bop stan in me had mixed feelings. Seeing the movie now i don't really care about this now and I think they work well together and I think all aspects are perfectly well done as well as the Birds. A lot of people say they wish Huntress had more screen time and I think I can agree with this I just didn't really notice. This movie is very stylistic and fun, with the editing, pop up text, camera work, soundtrack, everything is just so amazing. The action is always so fun in every scene. Margot really embodied Harley in this movie to the max and it made me so happy to see her truly shine! I also have to say I loved Black Mask and Victor Zsasz being the main villains as they are lesser known which I always enjoy more than popular characters. This is a new campy funny take on Black Mask while still being dark and twisted and Ewan McGregor may be the DCEU's best villain. I really hope the movie does well so we can get Gotham City Sirens next. Not only is this my fave DC movie but will become one of my fave movies ever and I'm already eager to rewatch it. I might even go see it in cinema again! Which I never do! I would honestly rate it 10/10 because I found ZERO flaws in the movie genuinely.

So, why is this movie ok? Margot Robbie plays her part well. Some (not all) of the action scenes are well done and interesting. However, it's not enough to rescue this film.

This movie is too silly to take seriously and too serious to politely excuse as ""it's just a movie, lighten up!"" Almost everyone is horribly miscast except Margot Robbie. She's great! The writing is bad. The sets are bad! Man, the clothing is even bad, and I never notice such things. The villain (I won't say his name) from the comic book has been emasculated to the point of being more insulting than threatening. The implication is that he's a gay, psychopathic killer; if that's true someone at DC needs to learn how to make their gay psychopaths more ruthless (they missed the mark on Lex Luther in Batman vs Superman too).

By the time we got to the police station fight I was just hoping for some reasonable action. Instead, we got a bunch of cops who apparently don't have guns and are willing to line up to fight her one by one. I sat through the rest just noting that Rosie Perez can't act. Whoever thought up the crazy rounds for Harley's beanbag gun had a great idea but it wasn't enough. Ewan McGregor was sort of wasted in that role. Margot Robbie managed to show us some acting in spite of the terrible script and even worse direction.

Birds of Prey: and the Terrible Title that Bombed Harley Quinn.,"'Birds Of Prey: And The Fantabulous Emancipation Of One Harley Quinn (2020)' hasn't really learnt any of the lessons apparent in 'Suicide Squad (2016)', retaining almost every element that made that picture such a slog to sit through. However, each piece - however misguided its inclusion may be - is simply done to a higher standard. This results in a film that's basically just fine. It isn't terrible but it isn't particularly good, either. Most of the time, it's plain mediocre. Yet, it leaves a surprisingly sweet taste, somehow feeling better than it actually is in retrospection. Its main issue comes from the fact that it seems to have no regard for the age-old adage 'show, don't tell'; as such, the majority of the narrative is narrated to us. Typically, the piece favours meta time-hopping and MTV-esque montages to fill in its blanks, trying desperately to seem like something spun straight from the off-kilter brain of its protagonist. At the same time, the flick wants to be an origin story for its other eponymous characters, without dedicating the necessary time or attention to these elements. The result is a messy movie that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, one determined to try and make its psychotic killer as likeable as possible despite her very real flaws. Like I said before, it isn't bad. It's just not all that engaging or, even, exciting. Probably its best element is its surprisingly competent action, which features some great, character-specific choreography and is generally well-conceived. It does use far too much slow motion for any of these moments to be impactful, but this doesn't really take away from the enjoyment of these scenes. Its cast are all good, especially its lead, and they make for a likeable team. It's a shame that some of the now unrestrained writing is rather clunky, especially when it comes to 'team banter'. Nevertheless, the all female crime-fighters/ criminals are typically good fun when they're together. The thing's underlying messages of 'female power' and 'sisterhood' are important, timely and relatively resonant. I wish the affair was better than it is, and that it would actually make some money, because the recent trend of generally decent but ultimately low-performing all-women action flicks is disconcerting to say the least. In the end, the movie is alright. It's not great, but it's not terrible. It's actually one of the DCEU's better entries. Make of that what you will. 5/10",5.0,16 February 2020

Yesterday, I experienced an abomination that the worst people in hell should be subjected to on a daily basis.

Birds of Prey got to be a case study on how not to make a movie. It is a monstrosity like no other in terms of every imaginable cinematographic aspect. From atrocious look, story and pacing to the horrendous acting and dialogue. Even the action is patheric and I don't understand how did DC approve this insult to humanity?

They got a good female character with Wonder Woman and I guess they think they can just throw any script and females together and it will do as well as Wonder Woman.

Wonder Woman kicking all that butt is believable because she has super powers. But somehow a small female can take out groups of men double her size is just stupid. In reality even a trained female her size wouldn't be able to make it past all those guys.

The soundtrack is epic, the movie has some ridiculously cool action scenes (there's legit action here, as opposed to the larger-than-life punches that superman has to handle, which don't really affect the story in any way). Margot and the rest of the cast did a great job, and the villains were nuanced, insidious creeps- which made for an excellent movie experience. The best parts were the quietly thoughtful scenes (e.g. where Harley offers Canary a hair tie bang in the middle of a fight sequence!). Movie never gets cheesy (ahem unlike most other DC movies), and there are only 4 protagonists besides harley (so it's nowhere near as cluttered as suicide squad was).

feel sorry,"I went to the movie to see the world of maniac, the psychology of Harley Quinn and Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel inside the madness and crime of Gotham City.

But what we got? The same tragody like Suicide Quad.

Great music only is not helping to make 0 8 15 fight scenes spectacular! And it feels like the whole movie was made only because of the 0 8 15 fight scenes.

To see Gotham City in the movie was like to watch the movie Hairspray.

Margot has driven the Harley. So far so good.

Ewan is a good actor but as Black Mask? In the movie he feels like a wanna be Joker not like a mastermind of crime and torture.

A bit to much...,"Much like other people who have reviews for this movie I'm going to talk about the Fempower aspects in this movie first so it can just be done and over with. Yes, this movie goes ""woke"". Yes it is annoying. Not a single male character is shown to be ""good"". From the borderline laughable portrait of Misogyne that is Black Mask, to the credit stealing police captain, and even a spoiler but still you'll know it when you see it. It almost makes it hard to enjoy anything when theirs not a single character that's a person unless they happen to be female, and even then all they really feel like is shells for female impowerment. Now, that's out of the way. The voice over is used WAY TO MUCH and the flashbacks are used in order to be ""different"" but shows how little of a story they have. Is their good? Yes, actually their a few good things. The editing isn't the worst DC films have had and the action fits the over the top nature of the movie which makes it fun to watch. The set desing lends itself well to having what amounts to a cool acid trip which I enjoy. The acting is....ok. All the actors are fine and you can tell they are having fun. which makes you feel like you're having fun. Is this movie good? Not even close but their is a sense of enjoyment to be had. Maybe, if u got drunk or high you could enjoy the amount of colors that go on the screen.

A Testament to Female Lead Films,"Birds of Prey is the film Harley Quinn deserved. It captures all her brilliance, and does the comics justice wonderfully. Margot Robbie was truly amazing, and the love and understanding of the character is so evident in her portrayal. Birds of Prey Harley is everything she should have been in Suicide Squad, rude, funny, excitable and crazy in a way that isn't edgy and pretentious (""normal is just a setting on the dryer"" is a line that will haunt me for all the wrong reasons). She is sexy without being over-sexualised and I am so eternally grateful to the costume department for ditching the suicide squad booty shorts. Harley Quinn aside the other actors are wonderful and their characters feel like real, actualised people (something that often gets lost in comic book based movies). This film, much like Wonder Woman is a true testament to women lead filmmaking and I hope it leads to more in the future. Easily one of the top films DC has produced in recent years it is truly criminal that it has been so poorly received, and I have to wonder how much of that is a result of either overt or subconscious sexism (how on Earth is this film rated lower than Batman vs. Superman and Justice League?)",8.0,1 September 2020
Harley without the joker is a joke...,"I really, really, really wanted to love this movie, as I adore Margot Robbie, but unfortunately Harley Quinn without the joker is just a joke.

The plot is a bit all over the place, the characters lack any depth, and even with Margot Robbie's great acting, I still found myself uninterested in what actually happens to Harley Quinn. I think DC really missed the mark by not making a Jared Leto Joker and Harley Quinn movie, as they had great chemistry and could have been really dynamic together if given the chance.",3.0,11 February 2020

It's a Nice Movie.,I liked it. It's definitely watchable. It has good action scenes.,8.0,24 August 2020
Are you kidding me?,"OK let me start out with this: I love female characters - I am a man yes - but I really don't care what gender the character is, as long as it has been well written and performed. I could give tons of examples of movies where the female characters outshine (in my mind) the male characters - but let's just take Guardians of the Galaxy where Nebula and Gamora are my favorite characters... Ok...

You know this is bad when I have to make a disclaimer first right? :-)

I really wanted to love this movie... but... ""insert random profanities here""

Ok the first and most important thing to point out is this: This movie seems to be very poorly managed. In fact, the action scenes looks like they aren't all part of the same movie - so I had to look it up. Some of the original action scenes were apparently SO BAD that they called in the guy who did the action scenes in John Wick to RESHOOT them ... and it shows! Those scenes + Margot is the only reason why I even give this movie 3 stars...

The Birds ... holy s... I mean really? They are just so weak it's insane... and no I'm not talking physical strength or fighting prowess - but story telling - or lack there of. Poorly set up, ""out of the blue"" abilities, lazy lines... It's not even worth going on about it, since I already spend more time on this paragraph than the writers did on this script!

The Black Mask/Roman Sionis - Ewan does what he can with this character, however it is the most generic villain of them all (in the comics) It is just ... WHY THAT CHARACTER? I mean SERIOUSLY DC - you are TRYING to build up the franchise - and on top trying to make this about female empowerment - then why the H... did you pair it with a throwaway antagonist? It makes 0 to little sense - unless you actually didn't care about this movie... which... is... what... it... feels... like. For crying out loud DC...

... And lastly it commits the cardinal sin... it's just not funny. I mean I laugh very easily - and I think I smiled like 2 times through the whole movie and laughed 0. It's a movie with Harley Quinn... how am I not laughing - she is probably the funniest character in the DC catalog - or at least in the top 3...... so how did they manage to make me laugh 0 times?

I literally can't grasp how people are giving this movie 9 and 10's ... Suicide Squad was better - and that says a lot since I hated it! Is it only because of the fact that it has a theme of ""female empowerment"" ... or is it a ""R rated superhero movies are AWESOME ALWAYS"" thing? I honestly can't think of anything else....

Margot Robbie relishes and inhabits the role - the main reason to watch the movie, but not the only one. Generally acting is decent except for Ewan McGregor (truly dreadful).

I've rewatched a couple of times, just for the visual eye candy, some humour and the central performance. I've given it a 9, only to counterbalance the negative reviews. Probably merits a 7.

Margot Robbie fits the role of harley quinn but not enough for a movie to be beautiful (3.9),"It was a very unnecessary movie that my expectation was a little high and I was disappointed.

Maybe it would be nice if more solid characters were added to it but I don't like the cast, they are all very good actors but their compatibility with the roles was not effective.

Margot Robbie fits the role of Harley Quinn but not enough for a movie to be beautiful, especially detective Renee Montoya was a very unnecessary character, just like Helena Bertinelli. When they couldn't use the Joker in the movie, instead they created a villain with Ewan Mcgregor, but it seemed like a copy of a Joker to me.

Odd but somewhat entertaining,"Just finished watching the movie with no prior expectations coming into it. Honestly, it was entertaining but there were elements to the movie I didn't care for and others simply prevented it from ever reaching its potential. For starters the movie jumps around a lot based on choppy narration which just felt disruptive to my experience and unnecessary. The main antagonist wasn't even who it was intended to be because honestly his right hand man Zsasz was more intimidating and active as an antagonist than Black mask. I won't get into to much detail but long story short this movie felt like it was intended mainly for women to connect to strong female characters and I think it did just that. However, in every other theme/aspect of the movie it didn't flow, felt predictable, and honestly felt like I was watching a bad Scott pilgrim vs the world take on a comic movie around Harley Quinn's break-up with the Joker. It's unlikely I will be re-watching the film but I enjoyed giving it a chance and seeing strong female characters fight it out in some great action scenes. I can say in that sense it was slightly refreshing from current movie options but still very much a lackluster movie that could put some to sleep or paying more attention to their phones only to serve as background noise.",4.0,10 December 2020
Harley Quinn and her Bird of Prey friends rule.,"After I saw Suicide Squad, I so let down by how bland, tamed and poorly made it was for a movie made of up crazy and heightened characters. Birds of Prey luckily is not that. It is by far a huge improvement with how Harley Quinn and the supporting characters function into the story and tone.

After finally breaking free from Jared Leto's Joker (and thankfully he is barely in it), Harley discovers the cost of being free from a toxic relationship with the most feared criminal is now she is no longer protected from every other criminal that wants revenge.

Margot Robbie gets to finally make Harley Quinn feel fully realized in her hyper and abstract performance. While Suicide Squid's used flashbacks to show her obssession with the Joker, BOP instead uses her breakup with the clown to explore her sense of indepence in a world that wants her dead, in jail or to be used. The story greatly shows how Quinn's skills of being a former psychologist can be what makes her alienate and infuriating the people around her. Most of Robbie's BOP co-stars get moments to shine thanks to Christina Hodson's screenplay taking the time to explore how each of them deal with living in the toxic, crime-filled world of Gotham. Jurnee Smollet-Bell gives a moral dimension to Black Canary as the daughter of a former superhero trying to lay low. Her character is the closest to being a complete hero but because of a simple nice act to help Harley, she ends up unintentionally as one of Roman Sionus's hired goons. Rosie Perez shines as the veteran cop Renee Montoya whose mission to serve the law feels unsatisfying with her sexist male co-workers looking down on her and putting a strain on the relationship with her district attorney girlfriend. Breakout star Ella Jay Basco as Cassandra Cain serves the emotional center piece very well to help Harley Quinn feel she can be looked up to for once. While I was really wanting more of her on screen, Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress becomes a scene-stealer with what little she gets from the way she brutally takes out criminals with her crossbow to awkward moments of her trying to be social. Ewan McGregor fully embraces how cruel yet also very pathetic his villain Roman Sionus/Black Mask can be. His character's attempt to prove that he is the coolest and most dangerous criminal in Gotham comes off as hilarious a lot of times. Yet there were moments when McGregor takes his performance to terrifying levels when Roman asserts his own power on others that he feels don't respect him in very disturbing ways.

Despite Birds of Prey being her second feature film, director Cathy Yan shoots the film with superb confidence and expertise delivering a hyper and frenetic energy that makes all the scenes feel very lively and colorful along with help from cinematographer Mathew Libatique staging the shots to feel very vibrant with specific color choices. And when paired with John Wick director Chad Stahelski as the second-unit to push the quality of the fight choreography to superb, Yan makes the action of Birds of Prey feel very heightened and dirty but still look visually-stunning to watch.

Unfortunately the plot is a little convoluted for a very simple story about Harley Quinn. The movie takes a lot of inspiration from the non-chronological narrative of Pulp Fiction and the fourth-wall breaking of Deadpool. While it does work with showing how unreliable Harley is as a narrator, it felt like it breaks the movie's face-paced, energetic flow. While the plot macguffin wasn't a doomsday device like in other comic book movies it still felt really ridiculous with how created large stakes for Gotham. It felt like it acted as a means to get the characters together to form the Birds of Prey yet it also makes their team-up feel like an afterthought. The reshoots on this movie did feel a bit noticeable with unusual scene transitions and certain character motivations. While these were problems I noticed, they were still nowhere near as bad as those issues in Suicide Squad. And BOP achieves what that previous DC anti-hero movie failed at is by embracing the full craziness of Harley Quinn and pairing her with a group of interesting and complex characters.",8.0,9 February 2020
Just more DCEU crap,"I really thought that the DCEU had turned a corner with Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Shazam! Each movie was progressively better and removed that horrible bitter taste left by such garbage as Batman v. Superman, Suicide Squad and Justice League. But this movie goes to show that is not the case at all.

It is pure garbage. The script is abysmal. The pacing is woeful. It has no heart. In short it is boring. Fortunately I watched it on a streaming service and so it was easy to ""walk out"" of it. I could only manage to suffer through the first half.

I have only just been prompted to review this movie after having suffered through the entirety of WW84. I would have walked out on that too but I paid real money to see it and I was the ride for others.

Tarantino+John Wick = BIRDS OF PREY,"This film is certainly a very good movie. Whit a very ingeniusly beginning that marks which kind of movie will you see. Under my opinion whit the best villian of the DCEU whit a spectacular performance of Ewan McGregor like Black Mask. I was surprised whit characters like Huntress, Black Canary and Victor Zsaz. The only character under my opinion that didn't have anything special funny or something like this is Cassandra Cain. Margot Robbie is spectacular in his role as Harley Quinn. This film has a loot of easter-eggs that a Dc Fan will Love. To finish I only cann say go to see this fantastic movie",10.0,11 February 2020

Not quite as bad as Charlie's Angels,"I don't understand how this rates at 6.7 on IMDB when you page through the reviews most people are panning it - and I expected it to be worse than it was. Sound track was fun, the commentary was fun, Margot Robbie is a class act, but there's a continuous shot in Knight and Day with Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise where they run at full speed across an exploding beach in one continuous shot and during it they pass a table and she wrangles her bag and gets it over her head and onto the her shoulders while they are running. Cameron Diaz was fit. Margot Robbie isn't, she clearly lives a sedentary life style that doesn't translate well into an 'action' movie, although she is a better runner than the flat footed Kristin Stewart. Cathy Yan's direction is better than Elizabeth Banks's by a long way, but the weakness of the stunts especially towards the end is really, truly appalling when you compare it to just about any other action movie, ever. Compared to The Joker or Deadpool? Awful, really, truly awful.",5.0,11 February 2020
It IS GOOD .,"Why despite the great reviews the movie didn't make alot of money. Still not a flop , it covered it's budget over the weekend. So did people just lost faith in DC because of SS and JL ? Or is this the marketing team's fault ? Tbh i think it's alittle bit of both. I watched the movie it's as good as Shazam . (Loved Aquaman but Shazam is my favorite.) . People fell out of love and don't trust DC to handle bringing the comics to live action movies. And the marketing for this movie was weak. The first trailer was awful . And they didn't bother with promoting like they did with SS . They spent tons of money on marketing on it. It was a bad movie but the marketing made it look good. Really people give this movie a chance and watch it. Ps: forgot to mention the title is too long. Should've been just Birds of Prey or Harley and The birds of prey.",9.0,12 February 2020

Harley's back!!,"Harley is back better than ever. In this film, Harley and the joker broke up and she is flying solo. When a young girl picked pocket a diamond from crime lord Black Mask (played by the amazing Ewan McGregor) Harley and three other woman, who share the same vendetta for Black Mask, must protect her.

Let me tell you something first. I'm a MASSIVE Marvel fan. I like DC but Marvel makes the better movies. However, having said that, ""Birds of Prey"" was a fun, action packed thrill of a film. It's basically the Haley Quinn show, but the other female characters had a chance to shine. Margot Robbie was born to play our favourite DC clown princess.

There are some flaws with the film. It's a slow builder at the start and the narrative can be a bit confusing. But stick with it. It's worth it.

I hope they make a second one of ""Birds of Prey"". This won't be the last time we see Harley ""Frikkin'"" Quinn.",9.0,7 February 2020

Feminist -ish Action Done Right,"Mostly. The acting, writing, directing and production was all done very well. But it still has a fair amount of feminist ideology thrown in, but done in a way to serve the story as opposed to ramming down our throats or being to femine for me to enjoy.

At its heart is crime movie in Gotham, it does not stray far from that and is not a turn off your brain over the top action movie. It has depth, well crafted violence and humour. Well worth a watch.

No this doesn't impresses at all.,"Birds of Prey is a superhero film based on the DC Comics. The film directed by Cathy Yan and stars Margot Robbie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Rosie Perez, Chris Messina, Ella Jay Basco and Ewan McGregor.

Harley teams up with Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya to defeat a gangster and protect a girl.

I read few bad reviews about the film but still a fan of DC comics wanted to give the film a try but found the film terrible. There is a section of viewers who liked the film to the core and were going gaga over the character Harley Quinn played by Margot Robbie but for me it was more of a miss then hit. They were trying to create Deadpool sort of film but barring few funny scenes most of the comic scenes were tedious and boring. The fight scenes in the film looked fake with the villains just standing and waiting to get hit.

Screenplay of the film is fast and probably goes in the favor of the film as it doesn't gives the viewers much time to think keep them stunned by the visuals and by Harley Quinn off course. Flashbacks scenes in the film were impressive.

Acting is decent to average, Margot Robbie started from where she left in the Suicide squad but might irritate few viewers. Ewan McGregor were superb and did an impressive job in the rest of the character Rosie Perez was most impressive of them all.

Climax of the film is cold and not at all excites much as I was waiting for some high octane action scenes but were more of a casual jumps here and there.

Being a DC fan I am disappointed from this film.",3.0,2 July 2022

Let's pretend suicide squad never happened,"After the announcement of this movie and seeing a couple trailers, I admit I was super skeptical. After the ginormous dumpster fire that is suicide squad, I did not plan on seeing this movie if it had any relation. A friend of mine actually dragged me to it, and I have a happy to say I was delightfully surprised.

Not only was this nothing like suicide squad, but it made a 180 on the franchise. With a new director, writers, and much better plot, they actually tried on this one. With the oversaturation of superhero movies on our market today, it's really hard to make a winner. This did it for me.

From beginning to end, this movie was so much fun. Margot Robbie please the perfect Harley Quinn, and it was a smart choice to make her the lead role. Because of the way they framed the trailers, I was worried it was another girl group ""feminist"" movie like Ghostbusters, but I was so wrong. It's Harley's story. It was a refreshing take on anti heros. It did what suicide squad tried to do but it actually succeeded and being entertaining and not problematic.

The characters were well fleshed out, the plot was solid, the villains were captivating, the humor was balanced, it didn't pander to any kind of audience, and there was no major traditional Love story which is refreshing.

I could not have been more surprised and more thrilled with the outcome of this movie, especially coming from a mentality of wanting to distance myself from this genre.

If you have major doubts about this movie, you're justified. Go see it anyway. Trust me, you'll be just as surprised as I was.",8.0,16 February 2020

A new and serviceable installment in the DCEU.,"In light of recent improvements to DC's critically mixed Cinematic Universe (ie. ""Wonder Woman"", ""Shazam!""), we are treated to a solo adventure featuring beloved supervillain (and 2016 cosplay icon) Harley Quinn along with a bundle of kick-ass female crusaders in ""Birds of Prey"".

I'm happy to say this is leaps above ""Suicide Squad"", and there's definitely good stuff to be had here. The action and combat scenes (especially one taking place in a police station) are rousing; and the acting highlights include Mary-Elizabeth Winstead as the crossbow killer, no I meant Huntress, and of course Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, one of the most spot-on incarnations of the character.

Ewan McGregor chews up the scenery as the villain Roman Sionis, but goes all in and makes for an entertaining baddie. He almost reminded me at times of Tommy Lee Jones's Two-Face from ""Batman Forever"", but not in a bad way.

While entertaining, the story is shortchanged by its' convoluted first hour (which might improve upon a second viewing) and mostly simplistic themes. Overall, if you're in the mood for R-rated action/popcorn fun this month of February; you might like it.

It's a disappointing hollow chocolate rabbit.,"This movie could have been awesome. Developed right, it would have been amazing. The good: it's eye candy. The sets are great. The effects are great. The costumes look great. The action choreography is great. And the acting bringing the characters to life is great. Visually, it's slick.

But... I found myself bored half way through. The bad: the story and character development is bad. It's a waste of great characters. You have characters with skills and powers, and they are barely used or displayed. Huntress and Black Canary were wasted in this movie and might as well not been used at all. Some characters were so badly written that fans excited to see those characters are now saying, ""That's the right name, but not the same character."" At least Suicide Squad made the effort to exploit their characters attributes and be a team movie. Harley Quinn is great in small doses, which is why she works so well in Suicide Squad, but gets annoying quickly as the main and constant character. I'd rate this movie as okay but it should have gone straight to dvd.",4.0,16 February 2020

I love Dc and think Harley is awesome. (Animated series was great and Suicide Squad was pretty damn good) I can sit through most movies and with being stuck in quarantine I figured this would be a fun actiony comedy. It is not..or was not. I only made it 30 minutes and felt what little is left of my soul leaving my body. It's cheese and not in the good way. Fight scenes have so many cuts in them you may have a seizure. The narration was positively unfunny, more cringe or plain boring than anything. My eyes still haven't recovered from the amount of rolling they've done. My favorite part in the 30 minutes I was able to sit through was watching a sandwich get made.

Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn,"What had the makings to reinvigorate the DC cinematic universe with creative and energized freedom, devolves into a forgettable mess from beginning to end. Although the film can be applauded for its cast, with Ewan McGregor and Margot Robbie delivering manic and entertaining performances, the film is plagued by its depictions of its characters. Harley Quinn was introduced as a crazed badass villain in her previous outing but is now depicted as a misunderstood hero who has problems equivalent to a teenager. Other characters in the film, despite how interesting they may be introduced, are sidelined for the main character the director obviously wanted to make the movie about. The violence, while fun in some areas, comes off as an imitation of other successful violent superhero films, overall lacking an identity. While the film has a flavor it attempts to display, the story and themes that accompany it are eye-rolling and a poor venture in trying to convey important messages that destroy the possibly perfect foundation it tries to set. This film had the potential to feel fresh, especially with the freedom that was given behind the camera, however, it is constantly plagued by a pretentious story and terrible character depictions that make an overall forgettable experience.",4.0,17 March 2022

Now I don't want to be one of those people as i hate those people but in this case its kinda right the only thing i can think of why people would hate the movie is because its very women empowerment it shows that women can be bad a** when they stick together and don't let them selves cry over a man.

harley deserved better...,"First off... i don't understand why caucasian males are so threatened by anyone other than themselves asserting who and what they are... they take great things and try to place negative connotations on them... ""feminazi""... ""tree hugger""... ""outside agitators""...

every single movie or tv show that features strong women is labeled a feminazi effort... and we're told how sick of having this shoved down their throats they are...

there is absolutely nothing wrong with female empowerment... after centuries of being oppressed they deserve their moments in the sun... yet males take these moments as direct attacks on their sovereignty....

that said... birds of prey was just an awful movie... and it has nothing to do with female empowerment... it has to do with a terrible script... writers that apparently never ever read the graphic novels... or just didn't care about the back stories... one of my main peeves with todays super hero flicks is that the heroes powers are elevated or diminished to suit whatever plot turn happens to be occurring... when the hero needs to appear more human he/she's beaten up by some random bum in the alley... when just a few frames ago he/she wiped the floor with an entire biker club... this version of harley was strong at times... weak at times... but generally just seemed to be incompetent... and unsure... harley's main characteristic is that she's bat s**t crazy... it's what endears her to us... it's what makes even the joker a little afraid of her...

this harley just seemed to be a victim... unsure of herself... and the idea that without the joker harley is like a boat adrift is just ridiculous... and is about as far from female empowerment as you can get... harley wouldn't have cared if the whole world were out to get her... her attitude would have been ""bring em on... one at a time or all at once""... harley is dangerous... and that aura is with her always... this harley... not so much... again... she acted like a victim...people aren't afraid of harley because of her association with the joker... where in the world did these writers ever get that idea??... harley quin afraid of a mobster??... give me a break...

i am sick to death of these neo-writers changing our superheroes back stories to the way ""they"" feel that they should have been... rewriting what made us love them in the first place... this latest example of that was a dismal failure... and i'm one of the males that wanted badly for it to succeed... harley is one of my favorites... and margot played her perfectly in SS... here... not so much... awful script... terrible direction... horrible character development... all in all an awful movie... and on top of that... those awful shorts made harley's but look flat... harley deserved better...",4.0,11 February 2020

Don't get me wrong there were good scenes in this film, but it fails when it's trying to make a statement that all men are total a-holes. Why does it have to be that way? Why can't it just be a COMIC movie and not some film trying to ""make"" a point. Other problems outside of Harley Quinn herself is the fact that casting choices for comic book characters are just lousy in the DCEU. No one other than Harley looks like their Comic counterpart and one in particular felt like a complete waste of time. I'm referring to the actress who will eventually become The Question. She was the character I hated most in this film for being unnecessary and a complete waste. Huntress has no character whatsoever other than being awkward and bland. Black Canary was decent but could have been better. As for the girl who will become Batgirl she didn't need to be such a brat. Actions scenes are great, rating this movie R was odd because it never felt like it and the title was very misleading since they don't become the Birds of Prey until the end of the film (they don't look great in their ""costumes"").

To everyone saying it's an anti-men movie, it's not! It's about Harley Quinn, and she broke up with the Joker. She is obviously upset and mad and that is why he is portrayed badly. The main villain is also a man, but that's not really unusual. It's a terrific movie, and I highly suggest you give it a shot!",10.0,9 February 2020

Amazing!!!!!!!!!,"I loved this film!! This is just my very personal opinion. As a 23yo girl who likes superheroes, it is amazing to feel that I can be one too! (as a girl). It's not the same for me to say that I want to be like superman or batman cause they have their own style and they are men and even If i try to imitate them, we have very little in common but when I get to see movies like this where women are the stars is just WOW. I feel super connected with them because they're not only superheroes or villains but they are girls that get dirty and fight and not the common stuff of a delicate girl or whatever stereotypes are for us. Idk.. I just love to feel like I, as a woman, can be super powerful as well. for good or for evil but I can get dirty and grotesque and fight as well. 10/10 I loved every single moment of it, although is not really the best movie in cinema aspects, it's a superhero movie after all and I feel like it should be seen as that and don't care much about if what you see is ""stupid"" or ""dramatic"" cause that's the point.",10.0,9 February 2020
Awful..... even by DCEU Standards,"Shame the focus was to appease the women lib rather than make a reasonable film.

There was new territory with the character and story to make something fresh and original however A director was appointed with 1 crap film under her belt, a writer with a few poor films under hers.

There was a lot of poor imitations to copy success and territory from other films such as Guardians and Deadpool which fell flat. A semi popular song every 10 mins weirdly incorporated and the forced swearing and poorly executed backdrop flashback failed miserably. Margot Robbie couldn't carry this film. The scene from Wolf of wall street we all remember her for didn't provide enough star power.

Ewan McGregor did ok despite his poor script and no direction on how to execute his character.

You can be PC, appease the social media girl power trend and still hire talent. Women have carried films successfully before - Sigourney Weaver, Julia Roberts, Charlize Theron, Meryl Streep etc etc and Directed with style- Katheryn Bigelow, Sofia Coppola, Patty Jenkins.

You kind of undermine what your trying to achieve in the first place when you put no talent in front and behind the camera just because of their gender.",2.0,27 September 2020
A lot of fun,"This is a fun movie. I laughed a lot while watching it, and so did everyone else in the theater. Harley has long been one of my favorite DC universe characters, and Margot Robbie portrayed her well. The violence was first rate, Leto was nowhere to be seen, and the entire cast had good chemistry. What more could anyone ask for in a Suicide Squad sequel?

Was the plot intricate and awe inspiring? No, of course not. This is a DC movie, after all. But it had a decent, simple story and carried it out well. There wasn't so much as a single eye-roll inspiring ""twist,"" like, for example, having enemies stop fighting each other and start working together because their moms have the same name. So, that's good.

Basically, if you like action comedies and want to leave the theater with a silly grin on your face, give it a shot. Be warned, though, that you will likely also have a strong craving for a fried egg sandwich.",8.0,9 February 2020

Is a satire a satire if it doesn't know that it's a satire?,"This was the question rolling in my head about 20 or so minutes into this movie, because I was beginning to see a pattern.

I went into this movie completely blind, other than I knew that this was a spin-off to the very average Suicide Squad. I thought I knew what to expect, but sadly nope. It had better action than Suicide Squad and more crazy Margot Robbie, who gets an 'A' for effort here, but the tiresome theme of men being bad because they're men reared its head and never went away. Then they doubled down on it. The men just got more nasty, incompetent, misogynistic, vile, and just plain stupid. The sheer hatred towards men was staggering. I was taken aback. Bear in mind though, I sheltered myself from Ghostbusters 2016, Terminator 6, Charlies Angels, because I saw the trailers and knew what to expect - I knew I was not going to be welcome. But I missed all the advertising for this and Margot Robbie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ewan McGregor? What could go wrong? Sadly so much.

The first 20 or so minutes are fun, pacey and anarchic. Harley Quinn is keeping us up with her split from the Joker, this all goes well, it's her movie and as I said, Margot Robbie really found a way into this character, and she ran with it. But when Detective Renee Montoya is introduced, immediately things take, how to put this, a sexist turn. There is simply no other way to put it. Literally, the male cop she is partnered with is seen as an imbecile who was not worthy of Montoya's presence. 30 seconds later we then learn that actually, she had her promotion stolen from her years ago by her old partner back in the day, who took all the credit for her great work. And he was a man. At least they made him a black man. If you're going to be sexist, better make sure to be inclusive here too. Despite Montoya being very capable at her job, she got no respect - because she was a woman. (seriously, the women writing this has no idea how men think).

The stilted character development continued with Black Canary, who was introduced in a haphazard flashback fashion, but zero backstory. We see her sing James Brown's ""It's a Man's World"" (yes really) and then, she happens to save Harley from the evil rapey men she hooked up with by using Kung Fu that Jackie Chan would have been proud of. But, because there was no backstory, we never knew how she was so accomplished at defeating men at least twice her weight.

Poor Character development continues, Cassandra Cain, from a broken family. That's it. But she's a genius thief. No idea how though. Ella Jay Basco who plays the greatest thief ever in Gothem is though, uniformly awful. The line delivery is excruciating. She needs acting lessons. Considering the amount of child actors in Hollywood you would think they could hire someone to deliver lines in a convincing fashion? I'll let you decide how she got the role.

Then we really - actually - get good character development! The Huntress - We know why she is! We know how she got so good! She'll be amazing!... and ends up with so little screen time that you wonder why they bothered. I actually felt sorry for Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who had to deliver bad jokes/punchlines near the end of the movie, and she looked very uncomfortable doing so. If you want to see what a strong empowered female looks like then check her out in ""Faults"" or ""10 Cloverfield Lane"". This tripe is beneath her.

Speaking of being beneath them, Ewan McGregor is in this, and he plays a spoiled smarmy sleazy man to a tee. McGregor can do this in his sleep, the problem here is that someone told him to hoot and holler for no good reason, so his performance looks forced. Again, he puts the effort in, all the cast do to varying success, but they are not helped by a script that even when working brings uneven results.

This could be because it's an action comedy. Comedy is infamously tough to pull off, because even the best comedy in the world is rubbish if you don't find it funny. And the only thing that made me laugh was the bail of coke (you'll know it when you see it). That joke worked perfectly, and I laughed and nodded, knowing that even when a movie hates me as much as this does, if you get the jokes right, I don't bloody care. Alas though, it was only one joke. No other punchlines worked or paid off.

In fact all but one of the jokes felt forced, much like the performances, so I went back to ruminating on whether this was a satire or not. Can a satire this earnest, this genuine, still be a satire? All of the malice and ill feeling towards men were almost like the movie makers decided to play misandry bingo. Women being prevented from advancement by men? Check. Women humiliated by men for nothing other than being a woman? Check. Men being condescending to women? Check. Men being rapey and creepy? Check and check. And, women are superior not only because they're great but also because men are so dumb? That's a Bingo!

I was going to walk out half-way through, because I knew I was not the intended audience, but my girlfriend was with me, and she quite liked it. So it's all OK. I'm not who this movie is for. Girls who need a sense of empowerment at the expense of men, who think nothing of 50 kg women beating up men at least twice their size, that is their audience. The problem here is that you can make a movie for that audience without having to damn the other 50%. Do I really need to say Atomic Blonde? I really enjoyed that movie, and the main character had no love lost for men in that one either. But the action worked, it wasn't agenda driven to the point distraction. All they needed to do was make women talented and succeful without it being at the expense of anyone else. It diminishes the heroes when the antagonists are pathetic.

Birds of Prey is best seen as a satire of 2010s feminine empowerment. Spiteful, hateful and wearing its misandry on it's sleeve. Written by women, starring women and mostly directed by a woman. Mostly? Chad Stahelski the director of John Wick 1,2 and 3, had to be drafted in to help Director Cathy Yan with the action scenes... Yep, this is a satire.",4.0,9 February 2020
One time watch but forgettable,Second half was boring and the first half was too good if you love drama,8.0,8 February 2020
Just as bad as Suicide Squad,"It took me two attempts to get through this film. The first time I gave up about 20 minutes in when Harley was being chased by Rosie Perez. One thing which Suicide Squad is that it was so laughably bad that it was almost entertaining at times. Birds of Prey is simply dull.

The story is nonsensical and the characters aren't really that interesting. Perhaps an ensemble movie was a poor choice to begin with. Making it R-rated was an even dumber choice. A few broken bones and swears here and there added nothing to this movie, but it sure was a good way to make sure that teen girls couldn't watch the movie. Hence the middling box office.

One thing which is perfectly clear is that Harley Quinn works well as a supporting character - she was one of the best things about Suicide Squad after all. But it is also perfectly clear that she does not work at all as a main character.

Her backup crew don't fare much better. Rosie Perez has played one character her whole career, and that's Rosie Perez. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is usually pretty good, but she's in this movie far too little to have any impact. Black Canary sure looks good but couldn't act her way out of a paper bag from what I can tell. And I know it's not right to be mean to kids, but I hope the Asian kid finds another day job. Ali Wong is a great stand up comic, but an actress she ain't. Chris Messina gets nothing to do and Ewan McGregor is the hammiest ham that has ever hammed.

I don't know who should feel the most ashamed: the director, DP, editor, or stunt coordinator. For being a big studio franchise action movie, the fight scenes are laughably amateurish. The main characters look like they have never thrown a punch or a kick in their lives. Sure, they hit their marks going from position A to B then C etc, but there is clearly no power (or even the illusion thereof) behind their punch or kick. I dare you to look at the fun house fight and tell me it's not true. There are amazingly talented female stunt performers - Amy Johnston for example! - who could have given the fight sequences some of the oomph they needed. But this was truly a s**t show.

There is a reason why this movie has a 78% score on Rotten Tomatoes. And that reason is identity politics, which is driving me, a socialist, crazy. Now I love political movies. Z (1969) or Missing (1982) are masterpieces. But not every bit of light entertainment has to be political. It's not even political in content, it's just surface level. And what is the easiest thing to do on the surface? Representation. Throw a couple of women and non-whites into the mix, and suddenly it's hailed by bloggers, journalists and social media figures alike as a political statement. On the surface. The content? Doesn't matter. That's too complicated and might endanger box office revenue. But can we get any retweets for a female Asian director?

Female ensemble? Check. Ethnically diverse crew? Check. Female director? Check. Non-white director? Check.

""You're not the only one who makes money off of dumb, rich, white people"" says the Asian kid when she's caught pick pocketing by the black woman. Any reason why ""white"" had to be included in that statement? I guess that's... ...what... ...progressive? Any chance the sequel (bwahaha!) will have a white character making quips about dumb black people?

There are countless articles about this movie and the ""male gaze"" (google it). Apparently it was a problem that Harley Quinn looked good and had sex appeal in Suicide Squad, and Margot Robbie must be protected from the ""male gaze"" (never mind that she got her big break in The Wolf of Wall Street where she had plenty of sex appeal and an infamous scene with Leo in their infant's bedroom). So in Birds of Prey she gets the clothes of a hobo hipster, the makeup of a bargain basement clown, and the haircut of a lesbian tween. This movie is not likely to inspire too many girls and women to dress up as Harley Quinn in Halloween, as opposed to her looks in Suicide Squad. But anything for the cause, I guess.

The most important thing is that the movie passes all the identity political purity tests which makes it near impossible to not give it at least a passing score, lest you be judged as a misogynist racist.

Let me be perfectly clear: I would dislike this movie just as much had it been made by a white man and starred an all male cast. It's just a bad movie, not a political statement. I loathe whiny man babies who automatically hate anything made by women. Just as I equally loathe whiny woman babies who automatically praise anything made by women. I'm an equal opportunity hater.",2.0,17 April 2020

Since these two were the main characters, it was somewhat off putting to watch. The other characters were so abbreviated that you don't really care what happens to them.

"The Lovable Sociopath in ""Birds of Prey""","I really loved ""Birds of Prey: And the Fabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" in the twisted hysterical escapist way. Props too, for the extended title. Calmly strong Huntress, played by beautiful introverted Mary Elizabeth Winestead, confesses to superhero Dinah Lance aka Black Canary regarding her martial arts skills, ""You can kick high in tight pants."" You don't often hear that in a superhero action movie. Just saying.

That being said, Director Cathy Yan's ""Birds of Prey"" is pleasantly not your typical superhero action movie. For one thing, not everyone is the conventional hero, like Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie in total swag with razor-like irony. Along with Christina Hodson's screenplay, Cathy creates the unique: The lovable sociopath in Harley Quin, the standout character from ""Suicide Squad"". Margot in blonde pigtails, haunting complexion, and cutoff shorts mesmerizes in bizarre charm.

In Cathy's animated prologue, Harley was the brilliant resilient little girl, who endured her abandonment abuse plagued childhood, becoming a prominent psychiatrist. She fell in love with Gotham City's villainous murder Joker, arch nemesis of Batman. In her spiraling demise, Harley fell into a toxic chemical vat; thus, altering her appearance also bestowing her great physical strength and speed. She's also the martial arts expert: No one kicks ass wielding a baseball bat like Harley.

Yet, her love story was not happily ever after: The Joker left Harley heartbroken. Still, she hides the break up, because being Joker's girlfriend granted the certain street cred. Although, Harley can dispatch any hulking thug with or without her beloved bat.

Margot's Harley Quinn is the beguiling paradox, ultimately making the visually stunning yet narratively messy ""Bird of Prey"" soar. Margot embodies distinct humanity even in Harley, who is so far removed from reality. Her dominant cynicism surrenders to touching maternal instincts protecting Cassandra, played by spirited Ella Jay Basco. Rogue pick-pocket Cassandra steals the diamond sought by Harley's night club boss, crime leader Roman, played by virtually one-note evil Ewan McGregor. Granted Ewan reveals in his incarnation.

In the strangely sweet scene, Harley and Cassandra eat their breakfast cereal while watching TV cartoons. Former clinician Harley tells her squad, ""Psychologically speaking, vengeance rarely brings the catharsis we hope for."" Amen. Yet, coming from Harley: WTF?

Yeah, the martial arts fighting is so cool, with orchestrated leg sweeps, knee kicks, and judo throws. Director Cathy displays a distinctive visual style for her characters and Gotham City. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique dazzles with his neon color pallet. What dazzles more so is the inherent narrative incongruity of ""Birds of Prey"": Harley and her squad are paradoxes, in a good way.

The cast is awesome. Rosie Perez is the comically intrepid Detective Montoya, who traces Harley through the series of grizzly gang murders. Although, Mary Elizabeth's Helena (Huntress) vehemently denies ""rage issues"", she's the trained assassin since childhood, seeking justice for murder of her family. Hysterically, Helena is the shy hero, who practices saying, ""I'm Huntress"" in menacing voice. Jurnee Smoullet-Bell is the reluctant badass as club singer Dinah. Jurnee's vulnerable awareness heightens her prowess reveal. Ella's genuine 10 year-old bravado as Cassndra hides the fear of the little girl, who just wants to be loved.

Amidst, the amazing martial arts sequences, the loud car chases, and hilarious wise cracks, what landed for me was: Harley's tears. Harley let down Cassandra, who was counting on her. Despite, her sociopath sensibilities, she actually cared for another human being. Despite all, Harley is the Hero. Really, that makes ""Birds of Prey"" worth watching. Just saying.",8.0,23 February 2020
Sorry but it certainly doesn't rattle my bird cage,"REVIEW - Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn

Again trailers have let us down, there I've said it. What promised to be an absolutely brilliant film in the trailers has actually turned out to be a complete turkey!

Follow the story (if you really must) of Harley Quinn after the Joker dumps her (what?), and how the genius of evil turns nice to help a girl escape from a crime lord in Gotham.

A crime lord in Gotham! Would the Joke even allow such a thing?

Complete mess of a story and I honestly can't see why Margot Robbie even signed up for this and then is reluctant to reprise the role in the remake of Suicide Squad.

Not funny, actually I tell a lie because in places it is but because of the fact one second she's wearing trainers (sneakers) and the next in high heels boots.

Seriously for all of the hype and money thrown to advertise this clanger don't waste yours.

Is that why they made the full title of the film 'Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn' so people have an idea of just how appalling this film is.

Sorry but it certainly doesn't rattle my bird cage.

I realize that the filmmakers wanted to make a feminist, female empowerment movie, but I don't think Harley Quinn is the character to use. She's a masochistic female whose codependency on an abusive monster is treated as a joke. And Rosie Perez is too old to be doing the chase scenes.

However, I liked the costumes. They were pretty.",5.0,27 December 2021
Better than 'Deadpool'!,"'Birds of Prey' is a really wonderful time. In terms of the films that DC/Warner Bros has been making the last 20 years, this picture is one of most entertaining, if not one of the best.

It feels like the film that 'Deadpool' (2016) wanted to be but couldn't quite live up to. Taking a page from 'Deadpool', the film uses Harley Quinn as a fourth-wall-breaking narrator, but seems to make better use of it than 'Deadpool' ever manages.

'Birds of Prey' clever screenplay that hits all the beats that it should while doing so in fun and unexpected ways. It features a very strong cast, with Ewan McGregor and Margot Robbie giving career standout performances.

While the film is titled 'Birds of Prey' with the subtitle mentioning Harley Quinn, make no mistake: this is the Harley Quinn movie. For comics fans expecting to see a story centred on familiar 'Birds of Prey' characters, you will likely be disappointed. But for the fan of 'Harley Quinn' comics, particularly the Conner-Palmioti comics, you will be pleased. As faithful an adaptation as one can hope for.

Overall, for comics fans or casual viewers, this is one entertaining film.",10.0,3 April 2020

"The best female action movie I've seen, in my opinion!","Birds of Prey is a highly entertaining action film that is clearly not for kids. For the first time, you get to see Harley Quinn's real bat and hammer action with blood. Margot Robbie is such a fine actress, that I believe she was born to play this role. Her performance as a witty action (anti)heroine is nothing but flawless. I really can't wait to see her in this role again, and for now, this film has left me satisfied.

Birds of Prey can be compared more with John Wick or The Equalizer instead of Superman or Batman. This is the best female action movie I've seen till date, and I'm not kidding. You get loads of action, a good amount of humor and a ton of memorable characters. I thought Mary Elizabeth Winstead was excellent as the Huntress, and clearly my second favorite after Harley Quinn in this film. Every action film about a team tends to have at least one tough and serious character and Huntress is that. Harley, however, is a mix of both tough and sweet: presented in a way that you just can't hate her. All actors and actresses were truly awesome throughout the film, including Ewan McGregor.

The action is the biggest highlight of this film, and is possibly the best action in a DC movie till date. It uses slow-motion and camera angles brilliantly, and its raw nature is the real icing on the cake. If you like action movies based on comic book characters and are an adult, check it out with a tub of popcorn. There's something really charming about the film's visuals, and it actually feels like a comic book has come alive.

Birds of Prey, in simple words, is an exhilarating action film that is a must watch for anyone who's into action movies and DC comics. Just make sure kids don't see it, because it really has mature content that isn't meant for them.",10.0,8 February 2020

This movie is a LOT of fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously, it's vibrant and colorful with an energetic soundtrack, and has some really well choreographed fight scenes. Despite it essentially being a spin off of a bad movie, don't let that scare you off- Birds of Prey distances itself from Suicide Squad i think as much as it can, for the better.

It also has no agenda, regardless of marketing or other reviewers trying to say it does. Sure, the main cast are all chicks who kick ass, but at no point does the movie ever preach to you. It never talks down to you, and it's unfair to compare this to other movies in this day and age that do. It's a simple, fun comic book movie about cool ladies who team up to take down Ewan McGregor's Black Mask, who is also genuinely one of the best parts of the film. I had a great time and absolutely plan on seeing it again, and I urge anyone who's still on the fence to give Birds of Prey a chance!",8.0,18 February 2020
Nah Fam...,"I wanted to like, I promise I did.

BUUUUUT... it just ain't it.

No offense to Cathy Yen, she had no business filming fight/action scenes. They were so bland and uninspiring. Her overall photography looked less impressive than a show on TNT. And that's not a knock against the fine programming on Turner's flagship network.

Margo phone'd her performance and her fight choreography in. She was so inconsistent with her signature Harley accent and when she did use it, was vastly watered down.

That was NOT Victor Zazas!

I was so tired of hearing Joker's name evoked, it got as obnoxious as the directionless plot.

Black Mask was the brightest spot of the whole feature, then maybe that charlatan of a Cassandra Cain.

Just Very Forgettable,"I liked this movie for about the first 20 minutes or so, but after that it just loses all momentum. The movie is essentially a fusion of ""The Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Deadpool"". But it is much less enjoyable than either of those movies. It's just action, forgettable character scene, more action, etc. The parts of the movie I like were Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, doing a fun take of the character, no longer in an abusive relationship with the Joker, and Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis. My biggest disappointed is Zsas, because I am a fan of the Arkham video game series and he just felt wasted here. I would say skip this movie its just forgettable and not really worth your time or money. If I had to say watch ""Parasite"", ""Uncut Gems"", or ""1917"" if you want to see a movie in theaters, because none of these will disappoint.

Not all bad - Just About Meh,"Poorly written and edited - but for the most part reasonably acted. Reasonable soundtrack.

Too verbose and with conversations that could and should have been cut back significantly without affecting what was trying to be conveyed.

Illogical, Wildly unbalanced execution and content of the fight scenes Not funny enough.

Too much tell rather than show.

Mates scored it as a 'five' given that the female actors looked 'good in hot pants' so also failed in selling its Wokeness. I'm giving it a 5 as I can't go below average as in that area you find '6 Underground' Need to reconsider my scoring system.

I loved it. It's nice to See Harley Quinn back in Action.,":) The movie was funny, and nice. I am going to tell a bit about it, but not so much where it will ruin it. It's filled with funny parts, which I loved. -- Awesome! & Acrobatic scenes from the movie the parts of the movie was really funny tho, because the joker broke up with her and she was depressed, she hung up his picture and threw knives at it, she joined an underground skating ring sport so she could beat up people to get her stress out. Also some guys tried to take advantage of her by getting her drunk first. It just reminded me a lot of how people are to girls. Idk, it's just a lot of funny scenes from the movie that this video doesn't show, but you can see some of the fighting scenes atleast here. There was one villain in the movie who was very sadistic, and he would peel people's face off with a knife. He was pretty freaky I liked how he died in the movie. They made him have a really good death scene. But before they did they showed how evil he was, he scarred his chest for each woman he would kill. Etc. The Death scene assigned to him was very fitting for him. Some of the movie is goofy, but most of it was good and funny tho. I don't mind the goofy scenes, since it kinda fitted in with her make-believe style super hero character. She had a pet Hyena, and she named it ""Bruce Wayne"" after Batman. I thought that part was funny as well. Most modern movies, I haven't really liked the fight choregraphy, but this one reminded me a lot of 90s movies. It's not super super realistic, but lots of twirling of weapons and the flashy moves/weapon tosses made it entertaining to watch. Reminded me of stick twirling when she got her Base-ball Bat in the movie. It was funny she had a Hyena named ""Bruce Wayne"" Which is actually Batman's name, so that's an easter egg for the fans of the batman universe etc. Since she named it after her enemies etc. Me & My Friend enjoyed the movie as well, and thought parts of it was funny. He rated 4/5, I rated 5/5 although there were a few scenes that was boring, which almost made me rate it 4/5, but I liked the character/ the movie a lot so I'll plan to get it when it comes out on DVD l8ter..",10.0,12 March 2020

The best thing about this movie was that beautiful Breakfast sandwich!,"Yeah you read that right ^ This movie was such a mess and it literally took an hour or more to set up the story, before you find out that there really isnt anything going on except for all the colors and flashyness. Aside from a couple of decent jokes and instances, it really wasnt that funny. In my theater, there was some basement dweller 30+ year old burst out laughing hysterically just because Huntress said ""Do you know who I am?"" as if she was trying to appear serious or something. None of their characters have their comic book looks through-out the movie, and Black Mask, and Victor Zsasz are really not that intimidating.

Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman were honestly better. Dunno about Justice League though, we'd best not talk about that one.

The soundtrack songs were good but there was too many of them and it felt like they were just crammed in there.

Aside from all the negative, the choreography was really good. Dance and Fight Choreography. One or two mentions of Batman. Nothing Huge.

"Okay, but only when compared to Suicide Squad","Birds of Prey: Hah Hah That's Clever is a continuation of Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn in the DC film universe. She was first seen in the infamous Suicide Squad film, where she was pretty much the only thing they got right in the whole car crash.

Unfortunately, while this is not as bad as Suicide Squad, I cannot in good conscience call it a good film. Especially because Harley Quinn is no longer as funny as she was in the first film. The writers seem to think that her whole character can be summed up to her being extra hyper and always up to eleven. With some psycho babble thrown in because in the comics she used to be a psychiatrist. And while that is an important part of her whole character, it's nowhere the only one, and I don't think Robbie quite gets it. I can see her playing a perfect Harley Quinn but for that she'd need a lot better script.

As for other problems, the villain is really pathetic. Total waste of getting Ewan McGregor to play him. Not even once did I find him intimidating or any kind of threat at all.

Furthermore, the eponymous Birds of Prey are one of the most well-known female superhero teams. So, why doesn't this film include any of their more well-known members. Like, you know, Batgirl, Bat Woman, Oracle, Power Girl, Poison Ivy. Sure, we have Black Canary, one of the two founding members of the team. Except that she doesn't function as a founding member here and her power is barely used in the film.

Also, you know who has never been a member in the comics? Harley Quinn. So, yeah...

Not that I'm opposed to changes being made to source material, but it seems like such a missed opportunity to not use these characters. Especially Poison Ivy, who has a one of the best and most nuanced relationships with Harley to be found in the comics. I don't know, perhaps they don't own the rights to the character at the moment, or something.

It's not an awful film. The fights are fun and shot well enough. It's colourful. Sometimes it tells a good joke. But it's just such a mess.",3.0,2 November 2020

Another tick for DC,"This is the first time DC and WB has allowed the series to hit the gritty streets. The only issue, is that the budget was too big. If they keep these films lower, they will remain profitable. Birds of Prey, maybe not the right title. It should've been Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey. There's a lot to like here, and the DC world now has a lot of female heroes on the mix. It was nice to see Black Mask, but that mask was bad. McGregor was much more villainous without the mask. The film is unique to the DC library and I hope it does well at home to justify more odd characters, not just the trinity, or Justice League characters.",8.0,27 March 2020

"Fun film made to fit Margot Robbie, but it does work","This film was born because Harley Quinn made it big among the funs of Suicide Squad. As I stated when reviewing that film it was one of the few properly written roles in that film, and Margot who's a superb actress made wonders with it. Combine this fact with the growing popularity of Harley Quinn as a character, and you've got the story of her ""fantabulous emancipation"" carrying an entire film. Thing is Harley Quinn's emancipation is pretending to be the secondary part of the movie, while the Birds of Prey, a group of female heroins fighting in Gotham seems like the real lead of this film. That's only the title, the moment Harley Quinn was made the story teller of this movie it was clear she's the real lead. Harley as a character can't tell a story in which she's not the lead. So the title is slightly misleading, but all the previews made it clear that this was her story all we had to find out was how much of the movie was left for the Birds of Prey. Truth be told, not much. But enough to make it fun to watch and to wonder whether there's enough here for a new franchise. The three real heroins in this movie are definitely under developed. Most of all the Huntress who's almost an afterthought in this one.

All of this doesn't mean Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor didn't give a superlative performance. same is true for Ella Jay Basco as Cassandra Cain. And everyone else on screen was at least very professional. Must address one point that was made here by some reviewers."" All the men are bad"", almost true, but remember where the whole thing is taking place. It's Gotham, the most corrapt city invented in comics until Sin City was invented years later, and it's happening in Harley's backyard where the best of the most corrupt come together to play their games. Harley herself is far from a saint and that's part of her charm.

"Birds of Prey a Harley Quinn film makes use of its R-Rating perfectly, it's entertaining and well cast - My Ultimate Review","Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is directed by Cathy Yan and written by Christina Hodson. The film follows Harley Quinn who after breaking up with the Joker is threatened by Gotham City crime lord Roman Sionis aka Black Mask. She joins forces with Helena Bertinelli, Dinah Lance and Renee Montoya (who go on to form the Birds of Prey) to save Cassandra Cain. I wouldn't call this film to be based on Birds of Prey as it is a Harley Quinn film, one of the founding members (Oracle/Batgirl) isn't even in the film and Cassandra Cain is an entirely different version than the Cassandra Cain from the comics and other media. I'll admit that I'm not the biggest fan of the screenplay, mostly because how they wrote some of the characters but the parts of the screenplay that I liked was simply great. Christina Hodson is a good writer but I think the characters doesn't fit into Harley Quinn, but in another way they work because how everyone is in the same situation, maybe it's because I'm a fan of the source material but it would have been better for a Harley Quinn film to be about Gotham City Sirens and make Birds of Prey a standalone film as these characters are great and well cast. The cast for every single hero/villain is perfect. Christina also nailed the comedic part of the screenplay. The critics criticized the screenplay but I feel like they criticized it too much. Let's talk about the pacing, in my opinion it's fitting for the character and that means perfect. I would have wanted it to be longer though so the Birds of Prey characters would get more screen time. Birds of Prey has some of my favorite superheroes so when I watched this film at the cinema I had huge expectations, whilst they were met, I wanted more out of it but we can still hope for a sequel (true Birds of Prey film) Huntress is far my favorite character in the film, if we are talking outside Harley Quinn and I wanted her to have more screen time, same with Black Canary.

Cathy Yan's direction is impressive, stylish and simply amazing. She works well with the crew and seem like she loves the characters and the DC property, I can't find anything bad with her work on this film. Visually speaking, she got down into the psych of Harleen and that's something the comics often do. I'm grateful she got the visual storytelling down. The action and fight sequences are stylish, entertaining and well choreographed. I don't know how much of the stunts Margot Robbie did herself but it feels like a lot. It's one of the highlights of the movie as each are unique and the R-Rating makes it more entertaining, Harley Quinn and violence fits better than her and Joker. The choice of music blends in so well with the choreography.

Margot Robbie shows again that she was born to play Harley Quinn, she was one of the highlights of Suicide Squad and her performance in this film is even better and more comic accurate. It's the right direction the character should go. Ewan McGregor plays the villain Roman Sionis / Black Mask who's a brutal and self-obsessed crime lord, he's the head of the Sionis Crime Family. His performance was the one after Margot Robbie's that I simply loved, I like the actor but he nailed the portrayal and succeeded in making it original and entertaining. Let me quote Harley Quinn ""You are so cool"" Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance as Helena Bertinelli / The Huntress is cool and amazing. As I wrote before in my review, the casting is right for every single actor and Mary was rightfully cast, she does the character justice. Jurnee Smollett-Bell's performance as Dinah Lance / Black Canary is perfect, she successfully made Dinah her own whilst keeping the character familiar to fans, I liked how she took inspiration out of Injustice 2 as the fight style and her Canary Cry is a big part of the character. Rosie Perez is great as Renee Montoya. Chris Messina's performance as Victor Zsasz is a fresh take on the serial killer but the original take on the character works well with the story and universe that they got going on.

Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is entertaining from start to finish that makes use of the R-Rating in a great way. If you're fan of Harley Quinn then you will absolutely love this film, also for fans of Birds of Prey but don't expect it to be about those characters as the story is Harley Quinn's. Having watched this twice and probably more to come, I can say that I still find it very stylish and entertaining, you see the love the creators out into it. I want to praise Margot Robbie for two things, first her enthusiasm for the character and second is her performance. I'm sure we will get a Gotham City Sirens movie sometime in the future as we need Poison Ivy and their relationship.",8.0,29 May 2021
Boredom beware....,"This is honestly one of my least favourite DC films of recent memory. Which is a shame because this did have a lot of potential to be good but from what I've heard, it bombed hard to the Sonic movie and right before COVID caused theatres to close down.

To be honest, I think it was for a very good reason.

The directing felt very shallow and uninteresting and as a result, some scenes dragged on rather than become memorable. The pacing was the worst thing about this movie as it not only felt inconsistent but that combined with the direction only added to the boredom. Unfortunately for this ham-fisted adaptation of Birds of Prey, the real boredom came from the lacklustre and incoherent writing, and as a result, I couldn't find a reason to care or to be invested in the story. To add insult to injury, the characters are completely different from the comic book counterparts and to make matters even worse, the changes that they made to the characters make them even less interesting (not even Barbara Gordon is in this film and she was the one who founded the group in the first place. And don't even get me started on Cassandra Cain, who is so different from her original character that if you changed the name or even took her out, it would honestly make the movie so much better. Just search up on her in this movie and you'll see what I'm talking about.).

On the plus side, there's good action, decent acting (especially from Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor, both of whom looked like they were having fun with their roles.), and pretty great cinematography. But that's about it.

Long story short, if the film suddenly disappeared from the face of the earth, I honestly think it would make absolutely no difference at all to the current DCEU. That's how forgettable it is.",3.0,14 December 2020

"Yes, it's that bad","Unless you're a pre-teen girl who's impressed with OTT makeup and glitter shotguns, you'll be sorely disappointed in this showing. Margot Robbie lends her considerable star power to this but does herself no favor here. It's directed by Cathy Yan who's only directed one other film, ""Dead Pigs"" which was only released in China with a $4k box office take - an abject failure, so how do expect this Harley Quinn film to be any good at all? You can't, it was doomed the moment Cathy was selected to direct. Harley's hard NY/Brooklyn accent is just grating, annoying and her referencing ""The Joker"" as ""Mr J"" constantly is also annoying. The fight scenes bordered on comical, and it wouldn't have surprised me to have seen graphics with ""Pow!"" and ""Zoink!"" thrown in.

Not bad, but could have been a lot better - with a good script.",5.0,13 February 2020
Enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would!,"This movie hit all the right buttons for me: it's fun, funny, over-the-top, with great action scenes and likable characters. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is easily the best thing in the movie. Every scene she's in is gold.

As much as I like this film, it's not perfect. The scenes that don't feature Harley Quinn weren't nearly as interesting, and Ewan McGregor is fun but not very believable as the main villain. The scenes also feel a bit disjointed at times. For example, there's this big action scene where Harley Quinn takes out a bunch of cops, and then afterwards, the film goes back to explain why this scene is happening, and the flashback goes on for a long time.

Another minor nitpick: this is very much a Harley Quinn movie and, despite the movie's attempt to develop their characters, the Birds of Prey feel completely secondary by the end. Yet for some reason, this movie is called Birds Of Prey with Harley Quinn being given a subtitle. Why didn't they just call it Harley Quinn & The Birds Of Prey right from the start? Makes no sense.

Doomcock is always right.,"This movie is a mess. No focus on making a good story, only focus was on how women are THe bEsTeST EVaRRRR. So much pandering man-hating, feminist, faux-woke girl power, female empowerment in this film it HURTS. Right in the balls. And there's A LOT of that in this movie. I lost count how many literal crotch shots during the fight scenes that there are in this movie. All the birds of prey-rushed backstories, heavy flashback exposition all riddled with ""toxic male"" caricatures and stereotypes. This film was also surprisingly insulting to gay men as well, Ewan McGregor is an over the top gay character who is somehow every ""toxic male"" trope combined into one. This movie was made by Margot Robbie, starring Margot Robbie, and FOR Margot Robbie. That's who this movie was made for. Not for fans, but for Margot Robbie.",3.0,18 February 2020
Solidly entertaining,"""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" was not the kind of movie I was expecting. It tells its story in a way that is different from most of the movies I usually watch. That's not a bad thing. Director Cathy Yan and company have a lot of fun with the material. Harley Quinn is a great character and Margot Robbie was born to play her. The rest of the cast also does a nice job. The soundtrack was also very good. ""Birds of Prey"" has a good story and it tells it with very little, if any, downtime. I enjoyed watching this movie tonight.

All hail Harleen Quinzel,"Saw Birds of Prey yesterday and absolutely LOVED it. Cathy Yan's team-up with 87Eleven resulted in beautifully choreographed fighting scenes with catastrophic consequences for the poor unfortunate souls who dared take on Harley Quinn and her band of merry women.

Had my doubts about Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress in the beginning, but seeing her practice her introduction in front of the mirror to sound like a true menacing vigilante only for it to come to a wonderfully anticlimactic and utterly satisfying reveal in the movie's third act convinced me of her prowess as Huntress.

Jurnee Smollet-Bell is completely beguiling and sexy as hell as Canary. The way her powers are constantly alluded to, yet never quite revealed until the third act really cemented my love for her as an accomplished fighter first and meta human second. Sidenote - and I fully agree with Huntress's comment - the way she can kick ass in those skin tight jeans... Mamma mia.

Detective ""I shaved my balls for this?"" Montoya is another delightful addition to this cast of misfit women. Not only am I crazy about her accent, but her gun-toting, whisky-slamming ways have found their way into my heart.

Last but not least, Margot Robbie. What an absolute champion. From her undying love of Bruce - after that hunky Wayne guy - to the literal frenzy she gets into for that eggs and bacon sandwich from Sal... She is the new Clown Queen of Gotham if you ask me, come to rightfully claim her throne from her ex-boyfriend.

In conclusion: do NOT sit on this movie. I can't remember the last time I laughed this hard out loud in the theatre or felt such empathy whenever a guy was brutally beaten up by a girl (Harley has a proclivity for cracking balls and smashing kneecaps' beware).",10.0,6 February 2020

Incredibly awesome,"So it's been a few weeks since I've seen this originally and a second time and I have to say the movie was such a blast. Director Cathy Yan in her first big studio feature really captures the essence of the title character and hits it out of the park. Picking up after the joker breaks up with Harley. She finds herself declaring her independence and being targeted by all of her old enemies that were help back because of her ex beau. Along the way a young pick pocket swallows a diamond that everyone wants and she must team up with a few misfits to try and keep her safe. I've really boiled it down to the basics here and I dont want you to think Quinn isn't a baddie because she still is. She kills quite a few dudes from bashing their heads in to feeding them to her pet hyena. The movie is surprisingly gory and the story and execution are colorful and wild. The performances are solid all around from an amazing Ewan McGregor as a wacky villain, a fierce Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the huntress and an amazingly kick ass Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya. Jurnee Smollet Bell is also charasmatic as the Black Canary. But the real star is of course Harley Quinn played by a remarkable Margot Robbie. She is electric in this role. She's insane and over the top but she also sells the smaller moments giving the character an impressive amount of depth. You can literally feel her heartbreak. As awesome as it is it's not flawless. There are some pacing issues and the story feels a bit all over the place at times. That being said the manic pacing and chaotic screenplay coupled with incredible action sequences, amazing fight choreography and stunning cinematography benefit the film. Making a unique wild ride and a cinematic experience that's wholly original and overly entertaining.",9.0,19 February 2020
"Yay, another ridiculous girl power movie","They had to pay for hundreds of high star ratings because I can't imagine anyone that actually watched this movie rating it over 4.

The most fun I've had in ages,"This film is one of the most recent of DC taking a different approach to its films, albeit on the extreme end- from dark and dull to insane and frenetic energy that leaves you bouncing off the walls way after the credits ended.

I found the fight scenes to be fun and somehow hilarious in parts, and they were excellently choreographed and shot- each fight bought something different into the mix.

All the actors and actresses did a great job- Margot Robbie steals the show with her amazing performance of Harley Quinn, and Ewan McGregor makes a fantastically evil antagonist. Even the side characters are interesting, not bland and bringing in some elements of the comic from which they originated.

A crazy & insanely entertaining ride!,"Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn continues with the adventures of Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie), after the events of Suicide Squad(2016). After breaking up with the Joker, Harley teams up with Helena Bertinelli/The Huntress(Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Dinah Lance/Black Canary(Jurnee Smollett-Bell) & Renee Montoya(Rosie Perez), to protect a young girl named Cassandra Cain(Ella Jay Basco), from malevolent crime kingpin Roman Sionis(Ewan McGregor) & sinister assassin Victor Zsasz(Chris Messina).

Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn is a fantastic film. Director Cathy Yan has finally given us an anti-hero movie we deserve, after the slightly disappointing Suicide Squad(2016). Harley Quinn who is undoubtedly the best part of the 2016 super villain team-up film, is front & center this time around. The R-rating definitely helps. Now, there are no compromises made to the action set pieces. The action set pieces are jaw-dropping. The comedic scenes will leave you guffawing. The visual effects are flawless. The prologue is unique & hilarious. Margot Robbie is the star of the show, as Harley Quinn. Robbie portrays various emotions with ease & grace & definitely deserves to be one of the key players of the DC Extended Universe, going forward. Rosie Perez is great as Renee Montoya. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is brilliant as Helena Bertinelli/The Huntress. Jurnee Smollett-Bell is outstanding as Dinah Lance/Black Canary. Ewan McGregor is having the time of his life, as the deplorable yet deliciously evil, Roman Sionis. Ella Jay Basco is amazing as Cassandra Cain. Chris Messina is superb as Victor Zsasz. Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn is a must watch for fans of Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. Go, have an absolute whale of a time! Can't wait for The Suicide Squad(2021).",10.0,10 February 2020
The Mobius Strip of Cringe,"Joker in Suicide Squad was close to cringe, but not quite - just an overzealous actor, eager to put his own unique stamp on an iconic character. Didn't work for me, but I respect the effort.

This film took that near-cringe, elevated it to full-on cringe, turbo-charged it, slathered a bucket of mayo all over it, microwaved it, fed it to the dog, put the droppings in a bag, and ding-dong ditched it at some other dude's house because it didn't really care enough about you to realize it had the right last name but wrong first.

From the first frame, this film is so cringe that the word cringe was created specifically for this movie.

I know, I know... not possible. Yet here we are.

This film's cringe-density tore through time and space, its essence leaking through just enough to spill into the past and create the need for the word cringe to be invented. Then it lay in wait for hundreds of years until just the right time for it to take physical form, creating the greatest-yet example of cringe.

A cringe so unique that it requires its own branch of study: cringeometry.

A cringe so terrible that the application of the word to any other object or idea in the history of mankind seems unthinkable.

A cringe so pernicious that it forces me to use the word cringe repeatedly, even though the use of the word itself had become cringe long ago.

A cringe so utterly perfect that all other matter has been squeezed out and nothing else exists within it; creating a ball of cringe so dense that it tears through time and space. Its essence leaks through just enough to spill into the past and create the need for the word cringe to be invented. Then it lay in wait for hundreds...

omg it's only 10 minutes in... kill me now.",2.0,7 December 2020
"Not a great film, but a fun one.","Birds of Prey feels like what Suicide Squad should have been. It's a Harley Quinn solo film, but dressed up as an ensemble piece, and with that it works becasue it focuses on the most interesting and fun character. The movie has some good visuals and stylish action to keep the viewer hooked, and there's a much better (and more subtle) use of music here than there was in Suicide Squad.

It's not perfect though. Ewan McGregor is awful here as he hams it up in a very one dimensional performance, and the rest of the cast are quite forgettable. The narrative is choppy and sometimes I was confused as to just where I was in the film.

As for the accusations of misandry and man hating, well yes there's no denying that there is a bit of that here. Almost every bad person in the movie is male, and most of them are portrayed as rapey and unfeeling pieces of s-h-i-t. It does sort of justify the violence against them, but it's a bit of a bad generalisation of men too.

Still, Margot Robbie is thoroughly entertaining in the lead, but it would have been nicer if the film around her was a bit more coherent and less gimmicky.",5.0,10 February 2020

Aimed at MTV music video style/Insta Girl loving teen girls.,"The style of this movie is like a poor version of Suicide Squad/Kill Bill directed by a copycat Guy Richie. Its entertaining enough because of that combination of styles but there's no depth or emotional attachment to any of the characters, if that's what you're after. It's quite the shallow and bland action movie but because of its rollercoaster pace you won't be bored, i think. Oh and a couple of cheesy moments thrown in too.

I wasn't a fan of Suicide Squad but i can neither say this was better or worse than it.

I just couldn't see what they were trying to do with this film or where it fit, in the whole DCEU.

The story is like that of a straight to DVD action movies with the likes of Seagal/Van Damme/Snipes etc.

The film is definitely aimed at instagram girl/reality show/tictok/selfie loving young teen girls. And thats not meant to be an insult, its just plain to seen who its aimed at once you watch this.

It doesn't feel like a comic book movie at all, just a generic all-girl action movie.

Any engaging and exciting potential of all these characters seemed wasted here, except for Harley Quinn obviously, who the movie spends all of its time on. I wasn't taken in by her in Suicide Squad but i found her bearable in this, but Margo Robbie's performance was wasted in this movie.

The main reason i went to see this movie was because i read that the John Wick director came in did some of the action sequences, then I kept hearing from critics that the action was the big draw here and i have to say that's a bunch of nonsense. There's one decent fight section but even that wasn't even on par with any of the John Wick movies and they used lots of slo-mo. A great fight sequence is when you can't see the choreography of a fight. John Wick does it brilliantly, it feels real with the occasional arm waiting to be grabbed but Birds of prey is the opposite, arms and bodies waiting to be hit, grabbed etc. with the occasional realism. Id say watch any John Wick movies if you want action and cool visuals to boot.

The rotten tomatoes critics score shocks me at how high its rated.

This film feels like it could have been so different, so much better.

The many songs in this are what made this film more entertaining and fun for me.

They were clearly going for female empowerment / heavy anti-man theme by showing that EVERY SINGLE MAN in Harley's life leaves or betrays her. That's not really the type of message I agree with.

I also felt the poor, pitiful, drunk, terrible dancing imaging they used to set the scene was god awful to watch. It was a pathetic woman in the worst (most basic) way.

It is like the actresses had zero training for the film's fight scenes. Constantly seeing women under 120 lbs easily knocking around groups of large men has become so unbelievable and tiresome, Hollywood needs to give it up. I assume this movie is made to appeal to women but I don't think most women are interested in this type of drivel. Ewan McGregor was horrible too, so the blame is not gender based.

Birds of prey isn't a perfect movie by any means , but it checks off a few important boxes (in my opinion) when it comes to films of this genre.

1. First off Margot Robbie does a great job of really living in the character the whole movie 2. well choreographed fight scenes that make the film deserving of its R rating 3. visually appealing in the colors, weapons, costumes, and set locations used for a lot of the film 4. this is a kick ass movie- one of the few (all) female action films that really holds up to these male dominated films , also for all the reviewers saying the message is ""men are bad"" I must've missed something because no where in the film did I get those ""in your face"" feminist vibes. It's really just a bunch of people kicking ass- that happen to be female.

Bad writing does the characters no justice. Big disapointment.,"I have been using this site for long over a decade now, always loved movies, but never felt the need to write a review...until now. While I do not like Harley Quinn as a character I believed Margo portrayed her just fine she played the role but damn is it a badly written role, like who is this movie even for? I have been following both major superhero universes for a long time, and I have accepted that the demographic is ""family in general"" or a younger audience than me. I've had my time, but this is just cringy to watch, everything about it is. What is that brown chick with the cornrows doing? Is she comic relief, where did she learn to fight? Her acting is so shallow and uncomfortable to watch. Is this her debut? as she never acted before? Was she forced into this role and didn't wanna do it, or is it just the writers fault? It is honestly hard to tell.

So what, Harley Quinn can beat up any man, and avoid the drunk cops' punches w ease, but all of the sudden she can barely win a fight against her? This is just one of many things that makes this movie so painful to watch. NOT TO MENTION: THE DIALOGS. Sounds like they were written by a random joke generator. This movie has no depth og meaning to it whatsoever, you just destroyed a potentially cool character and i will never forgive you for that. The movie honestly just feels like a one woman suicide squad movie. I is the exact same movie, only w fewer people, and way too many uncool references.

And give the women som clothes and muscle. I get that fighting technique is a thing and you teach it to level differences in size and speed and such, but are you tryna tell me that a girl with arms the size of a toothpick can do damage to the mountains they are fighting, nope nope nope ain't buying it. Not even while trying to take the movie from what it is, a movie made to entertain young kid nerds. Honestly this is offensive even to them.

And what even is that little asian girls' role? She seems super stupid. Running away from people trying to protect her pointing a gun at them, eating a freakin diamond, and of that size?? that's gonna kill her, diamonds are super sharp. it's gonna tear up her insides. She is a super irrelevant character, only in the way. She does not evolve (though none of the characters does, and I know it is probably just bad writing bc they were so focused on making it laughable for their 10-14 year old audience). Besides her acting is really bad, all her lines seems like they were recorded at the same time, speed and in the same emotional state and she just had to mime them with the exact same facial expression.

Maybe my expectations were too high, everyone was just so excited about this movie, really talked it up especially since the they threw the joker out but I think it was a waist. Jared, just as Margo has done their characters justice, it is not their fault that the joker in this universe sucks, but if you've read the comics you'd know that that's just what he is like.

This film should at max get 1,5 stars, but that was not an option, and since this is my first review, I've decided to be generous, you are welcome. ps. I could not finish this movie, such a disapointment.",2.0,12 May 2020

If you get an A-list star don't use a B movie formula,"I heard a lot of bad reviews before seeing this movie. Many said that they tried to lessen Harley Quinn's sex appeal and that was why it did poorly. While I could see why some may say that, I still think Margot Robbie brings the sex appeal anyway and that is not a problem. This movie suffers from several problems but that is not a horrible faux pas though, let's face it, Harley Quinn is a comic book character and sex appeal is the main sticking point for her character. I am being extreme gracious by giving this a 4 and that is because Robbie is always great to look at and may have been the only one not fully ruining men and women's Harley Quinn fantasies.

The biggest problem here is they took Margot Robbie who they expected to bring in A-list movie bucks but they used a really bad B-movie formula. Most of the movie is a Jason Statham or Jackie Chan movie. Nothing wrong with those guys but this is not Jason Statham Fast & Furious franchise but Jason Statham when he was second fiddle to Jet Li in the Hong Kong movie scene. It is not Jackie Chan in Rush Hour, but the Jackie Chan in multiple movies years prior to Rumble in the Bronx and only seen well after they had already been released. You have Margot Robbie who is about the hottest girl in Hollywood next to Samara Weaving and everyone else is the nameless faceless, non-acting Hong Kong movie scene. She deserves a cast and crew that makes big movies not this dribble.

Speaking of bad B-movies... Ewan McGregor has been living off the fumes of his one good movie, ""Trainspotting,"" forever. He was in the horrible Star Wars prequels that everyone wishes were never made. To be honest, this was likely his second best role though he did once get to play act next to Scarlett Johanson in a forgettable movie before. The problem is you saddled him with a relatively unknown character and if you are going to make a comic book villian at least give him a mask that will challenge that of a middle school kid with $5 and a ride to Michael's arts and crafts. Rosie Perez? Are you kidding? She hasn't been in demand since ""White Men Can't Jump!"" If you wanted grandma as the bad ass female cop you could have probably sprung for Betty White instead.

Even though Suicide Squad was bad, you can't expect this pile of slop to haul in big dollars when you went out to get a quality purebred race horse like Robbie, but then saddle her with Hong Kong B-movie everything else. It doesn't help they made the name of it so long know one will waste time trying to remember it. You use the Hong Kong crew when you can't get play and roles in Hollywood. They make some semi-watchable action flicks that from time to time rocket ship a few stars to Hollywood big time movie fame. What you do not do is get your big time Hollywood superstar and send her to the minor leagues if you are expecting gold at the movie ticket office.",4.0,22 March 2020

Violent hot mess. Promo for Creating killer psychopaths.,"If U enjoy watching endless mindless violent scenes on innocent ppl that escalate into more grotesque violence, than this film is for you . No plot, no character development for Margot Robbie which is critical in this type of film. Every scene has Margot, a thin female using a bat at times, jumping up, smashing & beating up larger males as if they were paper mannikins. No sense of timing, no visual choreography. Nothing to keep one interested in this messy gory silly boring film.

How this was even made into a film is beyond bizarre. This is not Wonder Woman doing good, but psycho, pathic clown killing people because she likes and enjoys it. The more violence she commits against ppl, the more she enjoys her life & choice of violence. Her dull monologues justifying her kills are boring & clearly show her delusions. Incredibly, she can simultaneously kill using her body as weapon, no guns, and still talk without being out of breath.

Science has proven watching nonsensical glorified graphic violence tips many impressionable / growing minds over the edge into becoming violent in real world, re-creating ""celebrated violence"" viewed in films. We ALL reside in real world.

This film never should've been made- it should have remained in the Comic book. Such garbage only kills brain cells, and creates psychopaths. Plot: bloody violence repeat; bloody Violence, repeat - for over 2 hours.

Complete waste of time, unless U want to become violent psychopath, destroy lives, families, and ultimately become imprisoned, hopefully with a death sentence, but not before you waste multimillions of taxpaying dollars in 8 automatic death sentence appeals in our USA justice system.

Review from Dan Slentz of ""Reel Tunez.. The Radio Show All About The Movies""",5.0,8 February 2020
Wannabe Deadpool,"This movie is rated R.

Suicide Squad was rated PG-13.

Why?

Obviously the approach of Suicide Squad was completely wrong. You got the baddest villains in the DC universe all coming together and they couldn't even cuss. the real side of Villains were diminished extremely just because of the rating.

And now it is obvious that they want to fix that mistake. They learned that Villains must have violence and profanity. Wrong again. The whole story of Birds of Prey needed no violence at all. If the movie is all about Harley making a name for herself and female empowerment, why are all the vilence necessary? They tried too hard to be Deadpool.

"A film I'm sure I'm not angry enough or happy enough at, as usual","Birds of Prey takes the DC comic-book movies back to basics after going artsy on us with Joker. Here's what I foresaw from the get-go (because it's easy to envision the future with films like this): ""Birds of Prey isn't really going to be that different from the previous time Margot Robbie portrayed beloved Joker sidekick Harley Quinn in terms of filmmaking quality, but it will be more overtly female-empowering in its themes and action, ergo the critics will let it slide"". And I don't think they strictly would have, were it not for the fanboys; now there's someone out there to spite.

What makes Birds of Prey potentially worse off than Suicide Squad, which still did well financially, is that it falls into the modern habit of placating a crowd that will ensure better reviews, at the expense of the only sorts who would excitedly pay to see a Suicide Squad-type stinker in theatres. Nerds like that tend to be the most offended at inclusive, anti-patriarchal platitudes, so why alienate the only people who would've secured financial success (it's not like the average comic-book audience attends a film based on approval from critics)? Of course, anti-fanboy comments didn't harm Captain Marvel's box office. Is the popularity of Joker and Shazam gonna save this one? Will the progressive attitude make it succeed with another audience, even though this failed to salvage Charlie's Angels? Is the brand gonna help that? We'll see.

I do agree that this is better than Suicide Squad (if I'm even allowed to acknowledge that film, what with James Gunn's forthcoming reattempt at a Suicide Squad stand-alone flick within the DCEU). It's superior in terms of characterization, cohesive editing, watchable color-grading, and having settled for one consistent tone by the time of filming - not having to make it a comedy in post with obnoxious graphics and hip music. Now we have something that's exhaustingly cartoonish throughout (Harley was already prone to getting old fast).

The main character is definitely crazed ex-therapist Harley Quinn, despite the Birds of Prey comics ordinarily being ensemble pieces, and the fact that she is slightly more human than the ditzy sex object we last saw Robbie play has been enough for people to preemptively name the film either horrible or excellent. The rest include Rosie Perez as Officer Montoya, Jurnee Smollett-Bell as metahuman Black Canary, and last but not least, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress, who will be the forthcoming subject of ""This is totally me"" memes for girls who aren't bubbly enough to communicate their supposed quirkiness via the Harley imagine macros.

The baddie this time is Black Mask (Ewan McGregor), whom I've known since teenhood as the DC mythos' equivalent to Red Skull, although his weirdly colored skull is merely a spooky mask worn by a cartoonishly sexist mob boss, don't you worry. His goons, including another well-known Batman villain named Zsasz (Chris Messina), are after a young diamond-stealer named Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), one of Batgirl's alter-egos from the comics. Initially, some of the Birds of Prey are also after Cassandra, in accordance with Black Mask's bounty, or each other. The team proper isn't formed until the finale, in fact, but I guess the film's subtitle prevents its main title from being all too misleading.

The heroines engage in ambitiously shot fight scenes, but the lack of quick cuts (although they're usually an annoyance) makes the occasional choreography hiccups too obvious. I suppose I should suspend my disbelief and enjoy the spectacle without nitpicking, but why settle with what's put before me when long-take fight scenes like those of Oldboy exist? Why pretend this is the best we can do?

I don't know. I don't know how to review this in such a way that anyone from either side will hear me out, because I'm not inflating my verdict one way or the other, based on who I'm trying to annoy. I try to look at what's actually happening on the screen and how I feel about those things - one of several reasons I have my doubts I will ever get to do this as anything more than a hobby.

I fear I am welcome amongst neither published film critics nor YouTube ranters (exceptions including the likes of YourMovieSucks and RedLetterMedia, since one gets the impression that they're sincerely sharing their opinions on the filmmaking, rather than largely basing the verdict on how feminist and/or anti-male they perceive the overall attitude to be). But then, I never did think fitting into one group was a virtue. Guys, what if I'M the Joker? So edgy!

"Another potentially amazing movie ruined by shallow, narrow-minded writers and director. Neither the world, nor the audience, revolves around your identity-politics.","I've lived in Seattle for the last 15 years. My mother is ""bleeding-heart liberal"", and I suppose I'm some sort of half-breed. Here's the question I asked my mother towards the middle-end of this movie:

""Name me a single normal, regular, or redeemable man from this entire film""?

Not only could she not do it, but she was beside herself. Initially she tried to name the one man in the entire film who ""attempted"" to protect Harley but, minor spoiler, as I was in the middle of asking that question, 'said man' sold Harley out, for no reason, on screen, like it some sort of ongoing inside joke by the director. ""Whoopsies, did we accidentally write that a single man out of the 300 we've portrayed on screen wasn't a PoS tyrannical stereotype of pop misogyny? Let us just write-in a quick sequence of him betraying the protagonist, for no reason, so that we can maintain our undeniable certainty that all men are disgusting PoS, just as we wrote them!

Normally, this is when my mother and I would get into some kind of argument. ""They're just exaggerating the social narrative"", ""they're standing up against the patriarchy"" etc. But nope. Even my mother was like... you're right... ""you have to go out of your way to write an entire script, where every man in the entire film, is following a blatant-identity-politics, anti-male stereotype... and not a single one of them has any redeemable qualities (as if men 'or all men' needed to be ""redeemed"" in the first place"").

Her words, and I'm not lying, ""women don't need to be juxtaposed against an unrelenting stereotype of male tyranny and male misogyny in order to (prove) that they're competent, powerful, or deserving of admiration"".

For the love of god, I consider myself pretty ""center-leaning"". I often label my mother as ""when the left goes too far"", and even SHE agreed with me. She even referenced Wonder Woman as a wonderful example of a strong female role model who's entire story, script, acting, and directing don't need to rely on ""all men are bad"" in order to inspire young women (and men).

I'm a man who idolizes Margot Robbie and (especially) Mary Elizabeth Winstead. I look up to these wonderful actors and human-beings, and I'm at a loss trying to reconcile what I saw here. I'm not petty enough to hold this film against them (or anyone, besides the director and maybe writers perhaps?), but I am absolutely frightened that this received such high praise from the critics and audience, as if this was just a normal reality that we all accept and agree on.

Imagine a man writing a film where every single female character was a scathing, kniving, unreasonable, disgusting, evil, fragile, egotistical, horrific monster. You'd be shocked, but I guess it's normal when it goes the other direction? Is it reparations? Perhaps men are over-represented in film, but they (and the women who they work with) don't need to write their entire script at the expense of women. That would be... ridiculous (or I guess not?).""Being a man"" doesn't mean cutting-down women, in fact, it means the opposite.

Ultimately, I wasn't bored. However, it was hard to follow the thin-plot when the film kept jumping around from, men are bad, men are bad, men are bad, men are bad, women are tough, men suck, women can do things too didn't you know? men are bad, women are tough, men are bad, screw men, women are tough. I'm telling you. I don't need to hear about how all my ilk (who I don't know, and have nothing in common with besides an Y chromosome) are all evil, in order for you to substantiate yourself as a badass woman. In fact, in doing so, you've managed to paint a portrait of a bunch of petty women who can't even manage to get through a scene without dwelling on pop-culture identity politics. And my god, does that hurt, when you're seeing your personal heroes (love you, for your talent, Winstead) regurgitating these lines like it's reasonable (or...anti-sexist, when it's the exact opposite).

Long story short, I don't think I've ever been so disappointed by a movie (I paid to see) in my entire life. 84% of people on Rotten Tomatoes LOVED IT, because they consider frivolously anti-male identity politics the norm. They were able to watch a movie that had 5x as much social exposition as it did plot and say to themselves ""this is normal, I'm going to ignore it, and enjoy all the good bits in-between"". But, ""the good bits in-between"", were few and far-between, and the director and writer's very narrow-minded perspective let down what would have been an incredible movie that actually would have established The Birds of Pray as legitimate badasses, rather than their personal political mouthpiece. We get it, you were probably raised in Seattle too. I'm tired of hearing about it.I've lived in Seattle for the last 15 years. My mother is ""bleeding-heart liberal"", and I suppose I'm some sort of half-breed. Here's the question I asked my mother towards the middle-end of this movie:

""Name me a single normal, regular, or redeemable man from this entire film""?

Not only could she not do it, but she was beside herself. Initially she tried to name the one man in the entire film who ""attempted"" to protect Harley but, minor spoiler, as I was in the middle of asking that question, 'said man' sold Harley out, for no reason, on screen, like it some sort of ongoing inside joke by the director. ""Whoopsies, did we accidentally write that a single man out of the 300 we've portrayed on screen wasn't a PoS tyrannical stereotype of pop misogyny? Let us just write-in a quick sequence of him betraying the protagonist, for no reason, so that we can maintain our undeniable certainty that all men are disgusting PoS, just as we wrote them!

Normally, this is when my mother and I would get into some kind of argument. ""They're just exaggerating the social narrative"", ""they're standing up against the patriarchy"" etc. But nope. Even my mother was like... you're right... ""you have to go out of your way to write an entire script, where every man in the entire film, is following a blatant-identity-politics, anti-male stereotype... and not a single one of them has any redeemable qualities (as if men 'or all men' needed to be ""redeemed"" in the first place"").

Her words, and I'm not lying, ""women don't need to be juxtaposed against an unrelenting stereotype of male tyranny and male misogyny in order to (prove) that they're competent, powerful, or deserving of admiration"".

For the love of god, I consider myself pretty ""center-leaning"". I often label my mother as ""when the left goes too far"", and even SHE agreed with me.

Praise God This Is Way Better Than Suicide Squad!,"Continuing on from where we left Harley Quinn after ""Suicide Squad"" (2016), things have now changed for poor Harley. The Joker has broken her heart and as you can imagine, Harley is not happy about it. Now living a life without the protection of Mr J (aka The Joker), Harley is wanted by many within Gotham City. Soon Harley finds herself in a situation that requires her to track down a Diamond as her life depends on it. But luckily for Harley, she will discover that she is not alone when it comes to battling new enemies.

I personally wasn't a fan of Suicide Squad (2016). My review on that film received a whopping 5.5/10. Thankfully I found Birds of Prey to be a significant improvement as a sequel.

Birds of Prey is a fun and brainless action film. While the plot is basic, it feels fitting for this instalment. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is once again perfect in every way. Her facials and dialogue delivery with this character ticks every box. She is extremely convincing in this role and I'm reminded that she was born to play this character.

Margot Robbie isn't the only major character from the DC Universe in this sequel. For the film's villain, we have actor Ewan McGregor suiting up as Black Mask. McGregor gave a pleasant performance but as key character I was slightly disappointed to see there was no back story or explanation as to why the character exists or does the things he does. The use of colours throughout is also creative and goes along perfectly with stunning and entertaining action sequences. The film's audio and visuals were stunning and a great compliment.

Any issues with Birds of Prey are minor ones. With Harley Quinn as a leading character, some other characters (such as Black Mask) don't get enough screen time or back story. The way the film tells its story may annoy some movie lovers. The film's plot constantly goes backwards and forwards, designed to give the audiences twist and mysteries. Even if some scenes don't make sense at the time, they will later in the film.

Overall, Birds of Prey is a major improvement when compared to Suicide Squad (2016). Sure, the plot is basic but it's also just brainless entertainment and I had a blast watching it. Actress Margot Robbie is simply amazing as this character and naturally steals the show once again. Some key characters sadly (such as the villain) aren't given enough screen time or really fleshed out with any type of solid back story. The film's style in story telling will annoy some, but again, I found it welcoming and fun. 7.9/10 - Walkden Entertainment",8.0,15 April 2020

Awesome,"Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey is an action/adventure comedy set in 4 years in Gotham city. It's open season on Harley Quinn when her explosive breakup with the Joker puts a big fat target on her back. Unprotected and on the run, Quinn faces the wrath of narcissistic crime boss Black Mask, his right-hand man, Victor Zsasz, and every other thug in the city. But things soon, even out for Harley when she becomes unexpected allies with three deadly women -- Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya.

My favorite character is Harley Quinn because she's smart. I like movies that grab my attention. I highly recommend this movie to action/adenture fans. I would give this film 5/5 stars strictly on how the actors and actresses played their parts.",5.0,22 September 2023
Slice of life movie to have fun with.,"At no point in the film was I ever bored and while this is a feminist film it should not be conflated with misandrism. If you want to see great action scenes than this movie is for you, if you are looking for a highly complex cerebral storyline then look elsewhere. Birds of Prey is a very simple story that reminds me of television shows that will write an entire episode around the average daily life of one of its characters. Nothing huge or Earth shattering happens but end of the world storylines are so common in super hero, or in this case anti hero, movies that it is nice to see a film where only immediate characters of a story are being affected, rather than an entire city or world. Over all I could have done without the annoyance of Zazz and a slightly more climactic ending but it was a fun romp that even managed a few audible laughs from me.",8.0,4 March 2020
Was this supposed to be good????????,Side characters must have a really awesome setup in order to carry a full length movie. Unfortunately this movie did not have that luxury.

Harley is Back!!!!!,"Margot Robbie's devil-doll Harley Quinn rules the way she did in 'Suicide Squad' in a punk feminist superheroine action thriller that's thin but lively. On the scale of damage that a devil-doll superheroine can cause, breaking a man's legs doesn't sound all that extreme. Yet when Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), the vengeful sister-of-mayhem in ""Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),"" breaks legs, she does it with a certain hellbent je ne sais quoi. It first happens at the nightclub owned by Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), a Gotham City crime lord, where Harley, having recently broken up with the Joker, is letting loose (not that she has any particularly more restrained mode), testing out her new identity as an unhinged singleton. Roman's driver tries to lure her into some vicious flirtation by calling her ""dumb"" and a ""slut,"" and as anyone who knows Harley knows all too well, it's the dumb part that really stings. So she leaps from a stage, crashing down onto his outstretched legs. Bam!! That's not just a violent counterattack, it's a 21st-century feminist moment. ""Birds of Prey"" is a superhero-team origin story that tracks how Harley, mostly through sheer happenstance, comes together with a collection of misfits to form a motley crew of kick-ass superheroines. As a movie, it's thin, lively, loud, brash, diverting and forgettable. If anything, it's a tighter film than ""Suicide Squad,"" but it's been directed, by Cathy Yan (""Dead Pigs""), with the same sort of in-your-face slapdash aesthetic, ramping up the comics into cheeky overdrive. Robbie shines radiantly at the film's center as the newly single Harley Quinn - whether she's rhapsodizing about a hangover-curing bacon-and-egg breakfast sandwich or emerging from a cloud of rainbow-colored glitter and smoke in slow motion, a sly grin on her made-up face. These are ladies who will happily offer each other a hair tie before heading into battle together. But Yan was wise to let the fight scenes play out rather than providing a false sense of energy by overly editing them, allowing us to appreciate all the athleticism and artistry the choreography demands. These birds truly do take flight.",9.0,27 November 2021

So much fun!,"This movie is enjoyable and entertaining for anyone who enjoys watching empowered women have some kick ass fun. Margot Robbie is spectacular as Harley Quinn, a cross between Villanelle from Killing Eve, Tank Girl, Betty Boop, and Elliot Page's character in Whip It. I loved watching her hijinks from getting drunk to her wacky, acrobatic fight sequences. Rosie Perez is a dorky, unappreciated cop, Jurnee Smollett is a sultry singer who can fight in tight pants, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is like a funny, self-aware Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and not but not least, Ella Jay Basco manages to be utterly adorable and super annoying at the same time - like most children I know. Ewan MacGregor is basically the same character as in the Halston series on Netflix.

Loved the colorful, comic-inspired cinematography, which is not as dark and ominous as in the Joker movie. The plot and character development were thin, but that's not really the point of the movie. I appreciated how Harley Quinn is allowed to be all torn up about Joker but it's ultimately not the focus of the movie, a good framework for girls and young women learning about developing their identities aside from romantic relationships.",9.0,10 July 2021

Way better than its reputation!,"So I only recently got into DC movies because of James Gunn's The Suicide Squad (one of my favourite movies ever) and since I really loved Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley (she was the only enjoyable thing about 2016 Suicide Squad) I decided to give Birds of Prey a shot. And I have to say: I really enjoyed this movie a lot! I think Harley's characterization is on point, so is Robbie's acting. While the story, with time-jumps and flashbacks and all may be a little confusing, this didn't lessen the fun time I had with this movie. Ewan McGregor and Chris Messina as Roman Sionis and Victor Zsasz were great and you could tell that they had a lot of fun with their roles. Another thing I loved was the costume design. I MUCH prefer Harley's crazy, over-the-top looks from this movie over her ""outfit""/underwear in Suicide Squad (2016) where she undresses in front of a group of leering and staring guys. The soundtrack fit the movie perfectly, there were some amazing jokes like when Harley offers Canary a hair tie during the final battle (EVERY girl can relate to that! It was hilarious). I really don't understand all the hate this movie is getting. It was refreshing to see an all-female cast kick ass (and honestly, who gives a f- if it's ""unrealistic""? So is John Wick, Die Hard etc.). I thoroughly enjoy this movie and after having seen it three times it still holds up. Deserves more love!",8.0,12 March 2022
Another Agenda Pushing Movie,It's too bad Hollywood has to push these agendas down our throats using characters we come to love over time. The girl power feminist push is over bearing and distracting even going as far as all lead female soundtrack. Wonder woman didn't push this crap and it was fantastic and did great at the box office.

A thrill ride to enjoy for every type of moviegoer,"Birds of Prey puts a lot of effort into its Female Independence background. I believe that the movie has a little something for everyone. It has comedy, drama, thriller, and more. Though I believe that the movie could have had a more put together story line, there was always something happening on the screen.

I believe that the movie had a bad wrap following its predecessor (Suicide Squad) and some viewers are basing their opinions on how that movie did. A strong issue that I believe the movie had was the title. There length of the title and the viewed title of Birds of Prey, didnt tell most users what the movie was really about. When speaking to friends that arent strongly in the comic book world, they didn't even realize this movie was about Harley Quinn which lead the astray from seeing the film.

Though some people may be judging the film from biased views, I believe that this film will be remembered and is a good step in the right direction for DC.",9.0,13 March 2020

Pointless,"Birds of Prey was such a pointless movie. There was no point in making this movie at all. Almost everything about it is wrong. Margot Robbie was kinda alright but her performance in Suicide Squad as Harley Quinn was much better than this. Black Canary was cool and Huntress has some potential to be better but they completely wasted her character. Montoya was terrible. But the single most annoying thing in this mess of a movie has got to be Cassandra Cain. With all due respect, the actress playing Cassandra was so bad it hurts. She was annoying and completely ruined the whole movie single handily. A character like that deserves much better than this terrible representation. Black Mask was maybe kinda okay. The direction seemed off. The music was good I'll give them that. The STORY of this movie is so freaking weak. The movie's plot revolves around Harley breaking up with the Joker. Which they do not explain why or how, they just say that it happened and you have to go along with it. It makes no sense what so ever. It's like they tried to force it in a really bad way.

I'm very sad at what this film could have been....but wasn't.,"They're offering covid-19 as the reason Birds of Prey bombed. I beg to differ. I looked forward very much to this movie; I love Ewan McGregor and I adore MEW and Margot Robbie. However, MEW needs a powerful story to really shine, and she did not have this as the screenplay was sub par even for an am dram by high school students. Robbie needs a powerful and intelligent director to really shine, and this she did not have. The bits that were good about her scenes came from her, and not the director. McGregor needs strong direction but good dialogue, and he had neither. He did well with what he had though. The story was half put together and reminded me of a first draft script that hasn't been worked on. I still don't know anything about McGregor's character. Finally, the non stop asides and throwbacks throughout the movie, voiced in that ridiculous accent, were off putting and not always useful to the story. The film had no soul, no flow, and absolutely appalling directing and screenplay. The score was pretty poor too. I gave this 5 and 3 of those points were for Robbie, Winstead and McGregor for making the best job they could of a crap film.",3.0,8 March 2020

Cool flick. Killer action. Amusing dialogue. GREAT soundtrack.,"Long time Harley Quinn fan. Became a fan of Margot Robbie after her portrayal of her in Suicide Squad and she certainly doesn't disappoint in Birds of Prey. She's got charisma and charm for days.

I wasn't down on SS and I'm not down on BOP either. I think it's actually a big improvement over Suicide Squad. The comics are all drawn differently so why is it always an issue when movies go their own way?

Secondly, I didn't feel like I was being preached to or lectured in any way. Not even a little and even if I did, who cares? If that's the approach they're taking then that's the approach they're taking. It doesn't automatically make the entire film bad, wrong or inadequate. Try to go with it, please. If this an issue for someone, maybe ask yourself 'what would I like about this story if I were the kind of person that liked it?' Not every thing in every film is for me either and that's OK. That's part of the fun. That's part of the journey. We're learning.

It's all subjective and I tend to be a bit generous with my scores but this film is certainly not a negative eleven. There's much to love here. If you want to pass on this, cool but at least grab the soundtrack bc it's great listen. Can't wait for Suicide Squad 2.",8.0,13 April 2020

Simple review,How or when did Harley Quinn become the DC version Black Window?,2.0,28 June 2020
"A few good things, but not so great","The film is stylish and competently made. Decent soundtrack, acting is great (for the most part) and I personally thought Ewan McGregor was the most fun to watch. His character (Black Mask) was not the same character from the comics. The same can be said about every other character in this movie. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is about as good as you can get casting wise. No signature outfit though. Wardrobe overall was not so good. I liked ONE action scene, the police station. Very well directed probably my favorite scene. The other action moments just were not as well done in my opinion. They went out of there way to make every man a bad guy, like unrealistically. A cop character is held back because her partner got a promotion for her work, and he is keeping her down. Other scenes with the men talking down to the women. The singer ""It's a Man's World"". It just felt like they were beating you over the head with it. If you are a fan of the source material, I am sure you will be disappointed. This is NOT a Birds of Prey film, it is a Harley Quinn movie. And none of the characters are represented as they were in the source material. Cassandra Cain is the worst offender by far! The character misrepresentation pretty much tanked the film for me. The writer, director and Margot Robbie herself claimed they were researching the characters and wanted to make it great. This is probably what bothers me the most. If they did research the source material, they seemingly tossed that aside and just get character names. Overall it's decently made and stylish, but it fails with the story and the characters.

Ewan McGregor must have lost a bet to accept playing in this movie,"I thought I'd seen the worst movie I was going to see in 2020 a few weeks ago with Saint Frances but this is worse. This movie started off badly, and progressively got worse from there. The narration, the order in which the scenes are ""told"" and the action scenes that make no sense... But why? About the action scenes: Whoever choreographed them has either never seen an action scene in the past 20 years, or was a bumbling idiot. Perhaps both. They make fun of ""Montoya"" - the cop that quotes bad 80s cop movies? Ironic... I found myself asking ""but why?"" way too often during the movie. It lasts 1 hr 48 minutes but seems like a 3h movie to sit through. The scenes that are supposed to be fun, come across as cringe. The music is loud, pompous and often horribly out of place. Their attempts at humor are really not funny at all. The cast, which is actually not bad on paper, must have woken up on the day after screening this, with a head full of questions. Hopefully their bank accounts will also have been filled with money because I see no other reason for any of them to have accepted to play with that script. The screenwriting is worthy of an episode of Blues Clues, actually make that a mediocre episode of Blues Clues. Come to think of it, I've actually sat through and watched episodes of ""Lazytown"" that were more interesting with better intrigue and writing. Honestly, with the ""missing diamond"" plot - it made this seem like someone had an old Pink Panther script that was never developed, and instead decided to adapt it to the DC Universe (But why?) see? Again... but why? I sincerely hope that Margo Robbie and Ewan McGregor's careers can both recover from this fiasco because honestly, this is their version of Pluto Nash.",3.0,16 April 2020

I've seen several reviews complaining about the characters but in my opinion most of them were great and I'm glad I didn't have to muster through unnecessary sexualized outfits and scenes, and instead experience girls just kicking and providing lots of fun and action.

A story told by one Harley Quinn,"I really enjoyed this movie. Its set in a Gotham we know, but haven't seen before- somewhere between the NY streets of 'Joker' and the high camp sets of the Adam West era. It works well, as this is a comic book , live- action movie, so has one foot in a world we know, and another planted deep into the absurd fantasy of a comic villains den. No spoilers, but for those who know the Adam West villain dens, you'r going to love the final fight scene. Set in the days after Harley breaks up with Mr J, this tale is narrated by Harley. Margot Robbie just plays it to perfection, and her action and fight scenes are breathtaking. As you'd expect from a tale told by Harley, its kinda scrambled. She forgets to tell you bits until she realises she's forgotton something and has to back track and expain. Its just so well done, all in the dreamlike world between the printed comic , film realism, and the world of Harley Quinn. The cast does a fantastic job. Huntress is a simmering comedy gem. Black Canary has some wonderful lines.

I loved that whenever Harley meets a foe , their name is put up on the screen, and their key grievance with Harley, what she did to them in the past. When she is confronted by Black Mask, ( Ewan) , the grievances flashed by too quickly for me to catch them all, but i think they summed up the reason why some people have given this rollercoaster of a movie a low score and written reviews that only question their own empathy and intelligence. I can't wait for the Blu- ray so i can go through them as that could spoil the momment for anyone who hadn't seen this yet. I hope comic book fans get behind this film. It is not a chick flick, its a fabulous breakout for Harley, a nod to the Gotham of the 60's, and a really fun story, brilliantly told bu one Harley Quinn.",8.0,22 February 2020
I made it to the end...,"Pretty much ruined Harley Quinn for me...the acting was as good as could be with the script they had to work with. The structure of the plot was good, way to many gaps no humor.

Just because your the first at something doesn't mean your good at it, the direction, and editing was the worst since Ocean's 8. I know women think they are all that, seriously 4.5 women against 40 or 50 guys forget the weapons just the whole final act was horrible even for a comic. In all the graphics, and sets were good, but again the editing was all over the place.

Obnoxious,"To pull of a movie like Birds of Prey, you need talent on both sides of the camera. Well, Birds of Prey has that, but not for this kind of movie, which makes me respect the team behind Deadpool even more. Action/comedy is really hard to pull off, as this movie is a testament to. It just doesn't work. At all. First of all none of the characters are likeable. Second, the story is paper thin. Third, no I will stop counting now, and just list the reasons... The fragmented, time jumping storytelling, which is supposed to be hip, is just plain confusing and makes you lose interest in whats going on. The villain is boring. The violence is, like Deadpool, way over the top, but not in a cartoonish, fun kinda way, but quite off putting - skinning someones face will just never be fun. The main character is just plain annoying, and when the story becomes slightly interesting, telling the story of Huntress, which to me seems like a much more interesting story, Quinn takes center stage again, and the movie suffers for it. On top of that the choreography in the fight scenes seems amateurish and poorly edited. Lacking any exitement and awesome moments. The major flaw of this movie though, is that it just isn't funny. What a waste of my time.",2.0,20 June 2020

"Solid Movie, Miles Better Than Suicide Squad","Did a double feature of Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey to get the full sense of Harley's character. SS was an enormous mess even its star power, but that's a whole other review to be made about its script, its pacing, its tone, its editing, everything. Birds of Prey in contrast was vibrant and refreshing, with a lot of momentum despite a less star-studded cast. One of the most solid DC movies in recent years. With less of a gimmicky feel in its self awareness, BoP didn't take itself too seriously the way SS did (which ended up stifling a lot of its characters' potential), so it felt miles more authentic. It's hard to make anything truly novel and un-cliche in this current era of reboots and sequels, but BoP kept me engaged and wishing for more beyond the end credits. Unfortunate that it didn't get the marketing it deserved and instead was brought down by anti-feminists afraid of more than one or two women in a superhero movie. Even more unfortunate that there's rumors about replacing the side characters and little possibility of a sequel because of the marketing ""flop."" It's a good movie, well worth the watch, and pretty unfairly evaluated as a ploy or pushing an agenda when it's just women characters written and directed by women. Nothing controversial about actually developed female characters. 🤷🏻",10.0,7 June 2020

Huntress could have been a great character, but no deveolpment and a missed opportunity!

Some people and critics say the fight scenes are fantastic, amazing etc. Did we watch the same movie? If you considered this great fight scenes, you must have missed so so so so so many movies which actually HAVE fantastic fight scenes. It's half assed at best. Most of the times you can see the attackers waiting to get hit, sometimes half stopping attacks so Harley and the others have time to execute a move! Pathetic! The police station fight scene. Really? She would have gotten shot in about 5 seconds. Dialogue? Slightly fun sometimes, but mostly awkward.

Robbie was right when she said she was just scratching the surface of our ""Daddy's Little Monster"". you'll see a crazier, thus, more literally comical HQ in BoP. McGregor as Black Mask was weighty. he killed his scenes where the audience should be hit right at their un-comfort zone; hence, a convincing villain. the action scenes, for me, gave the movie a snatch up. you don't even have to bring a popcorn--let the visuals serve themselves. for me, the real emancipation they pulled off here is from the clutter of its predecessor film.",8.0,7 February 2020

Polarizing.,"Decided to be very VERY generous because of Margots performance and a few fun and creative set pieces and the colorful and enthusiastic look/editing and r-rating. An effort was clearly made to get this movie to a place where the audience would at least have some fun and visual enjoyment. It's by no means a particularly good piece of film, but it's (barely) tolerable if you completely shut your brain off and like the schizophrenic and ridiculous things that you're witnessing without wanting more from the story or characters. It really does take a love of the performers/characters/aesthetic/directorial style to enjoy this. The dramatic egg sandwich narrative arc was a cute and very well done piece of this movie, perhaps even one of the best parts, which basically tells you everything that you need to know about the overall quality of BOP. It feels like a huge waste of the cast though. It could have actually been a pretty big hit with better creative decisions. Definitely don't go into this movie with high expectations. It's not that kind of movie. The soundtrack bangs though.",5.0,11 May 2020

Boring Birds of Prey,"Uninteresting script that alienates a major portion of the audience, acting talents wasted with plodding pace, I'm more than halfway thru it...I'll finish it because I wanna support DC.

See. With a little effort DC can make a good movie!,"This is what a comic book film is all about. Suicide Squad and the rest of the DCEU take note. Yes it had its flaws - some of the characters were little weak and underdeveloped, the plot was somewhat thin and the script laboured in parts, however none of this ever detracted from my enjoyment of the film.

Harley Quinn as a character is really quite interesting, and Margot Robbie portrays her exquisitely. What I enjoyed most about Quinn in this film was her distinctive fighting style. Suicide Squad was far too muddled for us to get an appreciation of this, but the Bird of Prey stunt team rectified this. They put together a trademark fighting style which really augmented the action scenes and added a further sense of identity to this interpretation of Harley.

Speaking of the action, all of it was fun! It didn't have the DC tendency to resort to two CG blobs smashing through buildings. It felt like the action from an episode of Arrow but more violent and with a bigger budget. Much more real and gritty, but still maintaining a comic book style charm.

Aesthetically I thought Birds of Prey was fantastic. We finally got to see a colourful DC film. The comic style freeze frames and cut scenes were great, and the soundtrack fit the film and its tone perfectly.

The plot was spread a little thin, and the sudden team up of our heroes felt a bit contrived and unearned given the rest of the film, but that's not a major gripe. The film zipped along at a great pace, overall making the film a delightfully bite sized comic book romp.

One of the major flaws was the lack of character development. This was not unexpected as it was always going to be a struggle fleshing out so many new characters in under two hours. That being said Robbie carried the show so well that I'm glad the focus was on her anyway and not the other characters.

What more can I say about Birds of Prey other than it is a fun film to watch! Definitely the best DC film for a long time and a great comic book movie.",8.0,11 March 2020

I loved, LOVED, the characters - all the women are from different walks of life, but really come together as a group and that is always fun to watch, and something that is often lacking in these superhero movies.

The movie didn't take itself seriously, and knew how to make fun of itself in a Deadpool-esque way.

"Fun, light hearted action flick","Feels like the negative reviewers out here didn't actually see the film.

Harley Quinn was an enjoyable and wonderful comedic super hero/villain film, and a breath of fresh air compared to the more serious DC or overdone Marvel formulas.

Felt like a great action flick about people ending up in each other's cross hairs through a series of shenanigans. Black Canary and Huntress provided a wonderful grounding to Harley's hilariously manic antics. Cass was not true to her comic source, but still provided an entertaining revision fitting the mass Hollywood audiences.

It was leagues better than that unfortunate Suicide Squad.

My complaints are it should have been significantly more violent (considering it was rated R), and the character development should have been better on some supporting characters (ie Montoya).",9.0,18 February 2020
Bady Written and Equally Poorly Directed,"'Birds of Prey' is a perfect example of hiring the wrong people for all the the wrong reasons. DC chose their writer and director based on gender and not ability or an affinity for the material. Consequently the results on screen are dull, clumsy and not true to the original source material. There isn't a single memorable line or moment in this paint-by-numbers girl power pig with lipstick. DC threw a lot of money at this project and clearly it was all wasted. These days Superhero movies are a dime a dozen, this one isn't worth two cents.",2.0,18 June 2021

I do wish the hyena came out more tho ha. But it's a simple movie with simple laughs. I will say if you don't want your child to see drug reference or a lot of profanity this isn't a movie for that.

Amazing,I don't understand why people are leaving bad reviews on this movie. For me it was perfect and Margot Robbie portrayed Harley Quinn Brilliant.

"""Watch the girl squad kick bad man's arse for 109 minutes"", the movie.","Nothing wrong about trying to deliver a message, but when you do it in such a blatant way it becomes almost like a parody. You can't base the entire film out of a political ideology and give it no more to lean on.

What we have here is a generic and even nonsense ""kinda comic action movie"" with some decent features just as the action choreography and cinematography, but with mayor weaknesses, those being the plot, the lack of characters development, the events and the whole idea of the movie itself.

While it's not a boring flick per se, it fails to pull out any kind of interest out of the spectator. You'll be pretty much watching some generic bad guys being beaten in the most stylish ways, decorated with the most cliché and predictable elements you could imagine for an action movie. The plot, seems to lack of real effort spent because it's all over the place. The main villain? It couldn't be more goofy and generic. The events? Some scenes and characters actions are inexplicable or nonsense, even for this kind of movie. There's nothing really captivating about all of it.

As I said, there are some positive point here and there. The acting is mostly good and so is the visual presentation overall. This includes the action choreography sequences, which are well done.

So well, it will probably be a major disappointment if you sit through it expecting to watch a decent movie.",3.0,11 April 2020
A Fantabulous movie !,"Cathy Yan made the most original and different film in the Dc Comics universe with her own style, Margot Robbie shines and she was born to play Harley Quinn, she steals all the scenes, a cast where all were excellent.

(Jared Leto) and the comics, I loved the final battle, and I liked the post-credits scene.

No idea where to start,"I saw the film earlier today and I am still processing my thoughts of it. Because of the coronavirus, the title was moved to VOD early. After trying 3 different occasions to see this film before this pandemic started, each time the universe prevented me from seeing this film. One time it was weather related. Other time, it was scheduling. Last time was because the projector at the theater broke. So I had to see Bad Boys for Life. Well, today I finally saw the film while being comfortable on my sofa at home. Maybe I expected too much. I liked Suicide Squad a lot and I am a comic book/movie fan. While the film is not terrible, it definitely was not great and barely even good. I am not sure what to say about the plot but this one was all over the place. The constant flashbacks became nauseating as well as the voice narration. Used sparingly they can move the story along, but these tools were overused the complete film. Margot Robbie is one of my favorite newer school actresses. She just did not capture the character the same way she did in the first film. She actually became irritating and boring. Not words ever used to describe Harley Quinn. It seemed like she was phoning in the performance. Ewan McGregor was awful. Period. Black Mask is not a well known villian to make us care. Not sure where they got this Huntess from but she can go back. She has been performed much better by the actress on the CW shows. I wanted to care about Cassandra Cain and her plight. But I wasn't at all invested. She was just irritating and we were not given any reason to be invested in her outcome. The only thing I can say that was good about the film was Jurnee Smollett. I have seen her in many films and shows, but nothing quite like this. Her Black Canary was different from past interpretations, not just because she is African American, but she has more nuances in her portrayal of the character. The audience is given some reason to root for her and be invested in her well being. I have not seen Rosie Perez in anything significant in awhile. She tries her best as Renee Montaya, but mostly fall flats. Knowing her reported back injuries from a tv show a few years back, I just kept grimacing every time she is throw into something. The stuntmen and woman definitely had alot to do in the film. There is quite a bit of action and its always good to see women kicking but on screen. Lastly, I wish there had been more references/ easter eggs to other notable Gotham residents. There is much more to Gotham than the Joker and Batman. But after watching this movie, I could be wrong.",5.0,30 March 2020

"Fell asleep after half an hour, but not for the reasons you may think.","So having started a woefully vain attempt at getting fit over the summer (read less burger shaped), I finally caved and bought some of those poncy elastic fitness bands, mainly to bring to an end the very long and sustained advertising campaign, complete with full psychological warfare across all things social media, that all the apps in the appniverse came together and decided was imperative, after I most likely thought about it briefly in a deep sleep.

On the evening my partner and I had decided to watch BOPATFEOOHQ (try saying that when you're leathered) I had just started out with a new laccy band workout video, as the guy and girl from the first series I tried were the YouTube channel equivalent of go pro cyclists, trying to do that whooping, shouty alternate beasting / encouragement thing that Americans seem to never tire of (they tried alternating good cop and bad cop, it didn't work and just left me thinking they were both sociopathic). The new guy I'm using is also an American, but more of a mid west agricultural type, bit daft but means well sort of thing, and he gets straight to the exercises without trying to convince me that organic chia seeds aren't just dried ants made to taste like cow pats.

Having finished my half hour sesh with billy bob and eating an exciting root and stamen salad, we stuck the movie on, and for the first half hour I remember being reasonably entertained, I recall one scene in particular saved me from having to gauge my eyes out with a teaspoon from boredom, but it also brought on the biggest wave of sleepy tiredness I'd felt in a long time, one of those rare and amazing sleepinesses where you know you're falling asleep, and you know it's going to be brilliant.

Needless to say I woke at the end of the movie, and my partners facial expression of ""meh"" suggested that hitting rewind was in no way a priority over more sleep, so I waited until the next day to watch the rest, and can safely say my partners facial expression spoke a thousand very accurate words. It's just ok, and while some of the acting was clearly being done by those who had acted before, and as such was passable, there were clearly quite a few actors for whom this was a first outing, or who just wanted a 9-5'er acting equivalent pay check, and who will clearly realize that acting isn't for them when they see it, and who will hopefully then get employment where being filmed with a camera isn't a requirement. We can but hope.

Anyway we are watching Air Force One for the first time this evening, and it's a rest night from bouncy bands with billy bob, so I'll hopefully be able to matchstick my eyelids through the whole thing. Ill post a review over on Air Force Ones profile page once gleamed.",3.0,24 June 2021

Add a soundtrack that consists of a playlist from someone who probably played Guitar Hero ten or so years ago, and you'll get the picture. Even Harley Quinn's voice is annoying after a while. Could have been better by far. Not even in the Sucker Punch way. It's forced agenda bs with too many f's and Jeff's for it's own good.

Movie in Summary: Poor (slightly below average),"I really wanted to like this more than I did, but besides Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Ewan McGregor as Black Mask, and all the colourful violent action, there's just not that much more to like. The Birds of Prey take 1 hour and 20 minutes to finally team up, most of the side characters were dull or poorly written, and the disoriented narrative was mediocre at best. Some action scenes were great and there were tons of fun colourful sequences, but this movie is all show and now substance. Oddly, I welcome a sequel, because this movie is at its best when all the Birds of Prey were finally together. (Or I just love me some more superhero movies.)

Recommended for: Fans of Harley Quinn, women, or people who like to do drugs and want something to stare at.",4.0,18 June 2020
A lot better then I expected.,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. It is a lot better then I expected it to be because of the hype and how disjointed Suicide Squad was. But Harley Quinn is so much fun so seeing it from her mind means bouncing around like a terrier after a ball. And you don't have to have seen SS because everything is covered, a few times. And I think some people have misunderstood the title and thought this was a team movie with Harley joining the team, it isn't. Harley makes the Birds of Prey team happen, setting up future movies the way Batman VS Superman introduce Wonder Woman and her 2nd movie is now (FINALLY) coming out. DC Entertainment isn't run by stupid people and movies like this are meant to help push a story along as well and tell it's own story and the thing it does best, Entertain. I expect to see the Birds of Prey heroes in future movies even if Harley isn't in them. There are a lot of Justice League stories, I'm a fan of the Dark Magic heroes myself and I'm hoping to see their story with all the other Justice League stories in the future. I plan to see this movie again, I think it is worth paying twice to see because there is so much to see.",8.0,11 February 2020

The action is different and really keeps you engaged. It's also hilarious in that dry humor kind of way. I personally loved it!

Fantabulous Indeed,"The upward trend of the quality of DCEU films continues with Birds Of Prey. With some great movies such as Wonder Woman and Shazam!, they've hit a new height. A big reason for this is Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn. She encapsulates the character brilliantly, switching from slightly depressed to absolutely crazy on a dime. The pacing is kinda all over the place, and while that's usually not a good thing, it fits this movie and the tone perfectly. The film also oozes style and contains some frantic editing, which again, fits right in.

Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis, aka the Black Hood, is the best villain of the DCEU so far. He's charismatic but menacing and you're never quite sure what he's going to do next. I got basically everything I wanted from this movie. Humour, great action sequences, very nice cinematography, costumes and production design. It's as in your face as a Harley Quinn movie should be. The supporting cast, the birds of prey, all put in good performances too. Any movie with a fight scene set to 'Barracuda' by Heart is gonna be a win in my book.",10.0,10 February 2020

Overly childish and pretty immature, this movie was badly scripted and made me cringe more times than I can count.

The plot was all over the place (despite being overly predictable) and DC is now forcing us to accept a version of Harley Quinn that goes against everything we've come to know her for. Where's the fierce, saddistic and ingenious character that we've come to love through the comic books?

There were very few highs in this movie and numerous lows. The only thing you'd mostly remember is the high pitched squealing from Harley everytime she attempts to talk.

The little Chinese girl swallows a diamond and Black Mask wants to kill her to take it back. The 5 girls gather to fight at the end because of the fate (and the script).

It also felt a bit cringe at certain situations and the dialogue didn't feel suitable from other characters, other than all that I thought Margot Robbie's performance was great and the action sequences were good mostly.

Disaster,"Looks like the creators of Joker did not have enough success with that movie that's why they decided to write a quick side story while sitting in the toilet right before launching this absolutely empty trash. The amount of idea is a massive ZERO and if i could set the score lower than 1 i would give -10. The empty movie tells us nothing, showing the lowest behaviour lines ever can imagine, such as vomiting in somebody's bag, or feeding humans to hyaenas and the only positive moment is Ewan McGregor, who sadly had to express soo much of bad language out of his mouth. Do not waste your time and don't hurt your eyes, ears and brain!!!",1.0,5 April 2020
"Waste of time, not horrible like Suicide Squad was, tho.","I always stay to see after credits if there is one, but I just wasn't interested in this one. It's that big ""whatever"" of a movie.

It seems DCEU is just not meant to be and work it's kinks out. I mean this is like, seventh or eighth movie or something along those lines and only Shazam and WW were worth a damn.

As for the movie itself, it's mostly boring, plot is really thin and stupid, acting is okay for the most part. However, tempo, editing and general cohesion of the film itself is all over the place, trying to hide it's flaws with very messy storytelling.

About mid runtime, there's a police station action scene, and it actually looked like it's finally gonna kick into the higher gear and start to be a good movie. But no, after that, it got boring again. Jokes are all but one - bad, flat. The only chuckle I had was during ""They call me... "" bits with Huntress.

I don't think Black Mask is a good villain in general, however, this movie's version is probably the worst. For a guy that calls himself ""Black Mask"" he wears it - and I'm not kidding - for 20 seconds, tops, throughout the whole movie. He's kinda wacky, but really isn't. As for the main ""hero"" cast, Jurnee's Black Cannary was probably the best character in it. But the camera is mostly pointed at Harley Quinn and, man, she's just try-too-hard, tiresome after a while.

One more thing that I noticed, everyone is dressed so ugly, and the movie itself looks ugly, nondescript.

For a time, I've actually expected at least fun movie, it really didn't have to be good, just fun. Instead, it was boring, not super bad, just boring, underdeveloped... like the DCEU itself.",5.0,9 February 2020

"Fragments of a potentially good movie are to be found, but never put together.","I originally thought this movie was only serviceable, but watching it for the second time really opened my eyes to how bad it really is. The acting all around is a mixed bag, definitely down to the director as these actors and actresses are definitely talented and can work with the right people. The jokes are very hit or miss, trying to be the DCEU equivalent to Deadpool while at the same time trying to do it's own thing which results in many scattershot attempts at humour that fail to make an impression. The script as a whole functions OK enough when you don't really think about it, but it's all of the other elements of the film that drag it down. The Birds of Prey themselves are barely in this film, so not calling it ""Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey"" from the get-go was an odd marketing choice.

I like action films, but as in every form of life, women are second rate to men, so the lead character has to be either very good or very attractive to look at, and Hayley Quinn just isn't.

Seeing the end credits it's obviously one of those #MeToo films with writers, directors, producers etc being women, whereby Hollywood felt obliged to let them have a play at making a movie to shut the dykes up. Well they failed, so stick to the kitchen or getting laid on the casting couch.

The writer should be ashamed,I don't overreact and give 1's when I don't like a movie but this movie was pretty heinous. The script is brutal and it's hard to tell whether it's just a myriad of casting mistakes or if the script is truly irredeemable. Margot is the only saving grace but even she forgot how to play this character a little and devolved into a slightly cooky long islander. None of the characters actions make any sense. The movie makes huge leaps in reasoning and logic. I didn't have high hopes and was still let down tremendously. Rosie Perez's character (along with nearly all characters) is pointless and 1 dimensional. If Euan Mcgrecgor ever takes his own life look to this movie for the seeds of failure based depression. I almost never write reviews and usually only positive ones. This was that bad.,4.0,1 April 2020
So much fun,"This was such a fun ride! The disjointed mind of a madwoman finding herself and telling the story of her independence. It's a visual explosion (literally and figuratively) and it was so fun to see an action movie with a female lens. I didn't expect how deeply rewarding that would be.

Of course Margot Robbie was incredible, but Rosie Perez *really* shined as Det. Montoya. She gave the movie something of an anchor. I wish there had been more development of Huntress and Black Canary, but I guess you've gotta save something for the sequel. Cassandra Caine's character was an interesting choice but it works and she serves as a sort of Pre-Ivy side-kick for Harley.

I dont know HOW someone could dislike this movie,"This was seriously just such a fun, lighthearted action flick with sweet female friendships and an eyecatchingly dope color scheme!! What's not to like? Seriously, whats not to like- why are there so many negative reviews on here?

I'm a fan of the comics and though I'm sad that the actual Birds of Prey weren't highlighted enough, I'm honestly just appreciative that they made it to the screen AT ALL given DC's favoritism towards male characters :eyeroll:.

Plus it makes sense why the film was set up this way- Harley is basically guaranteed to bring in new viewers, but DC prob didn't wanna put all their chips on a new team like with Suicide Squad to potentially have ppl not like them and hate the movie. I see this as a nice intro to the BoP (hence why its subtitle is the Fantabulous somethinsomethin Harley Quinn) and since it OBVIOUSLY set itself up for a sequel, we'll get to see more of our girls in action next time around!!

But fr this movie is genuinely cool af- the fighting choreography is absolutely my FAVE, its so fresh and exciting! That and the costuming... and sets.... okay Im a huge sucker for the visuals. But the jokes land perfectly too!

I think most of the negative reviews are coming from lame fanboys that would never comment this stuff if the main character was a guy (oh yeah I'm playing that card! Bc there are stupidly high expectations for ALL female-led comic book films to be absolutely perfect in EVERY way. Also, ppl keep crying ""wah this is just female Deadpool"" as if Deadpool created the snarky vigilante trope or smth?? Yall didnt complain when Star-Lord was just Tony Stark in space or when Dr. Strange was just Tony Stark with a cape, so drop it.)

"A joyous, fun time","I was not expecting to like Birds of Prey. I thought it was going to be another R-rated superhero film that tried to push the envelope, and while it was certainly an R-rated film, it was very enjoyable with the R-rating content feeling not forced but a smooth fit for the film.

The characters and cinematography are colorful and energetic. The film is told very non-linearly, but it fits Harley Quinn's hyperactive stream of consciousness perfectly, making her the perfect narrator.

A lot of flack is given towards the film regarding not the subtitle, which seems to be the main plot to this film, but its main title, which seems developed on the side.

Yes, the characters are sort of sprinkled in as the film goes along, but I prefer this over Suicide Squad's character intro assault from the beginning of that film. This feels natural and builds up to the inevitable Birds of Prey that this film advertises.

It feels messy, but the sort of messy when you have sweets all over your fingers. It still tastes good and perhaps better for it. This film will not be considered making some grand statement about society, but it's very enjoyable and it's one of the best superhero team-up films of all time.",8.0,18 February 2020

I won't blame them for hating it. Because this is the matter of point of view. But to be honest, if you are not a person who anti-feminism or love Joker, give this movie a try.

Like you know 95% of crime is committed by men? I thought movies are supposed to be realistic? Plus women are always exploited in the workforce, that's fact.

Better than the 2002/3 Birds of Prey show and that´s it,"I have been reading DC comics since the mid-90s, actually liked Suicide Squad Extended Edition (it was weirdly comic accurate by the standards of these adaptations) and I love Harley´s new TV-Ma rated cartoon but I had to force myself to pay attention here. The film has little to do with anything, neither the performances nor the visuals stand out and both the direction and writing feel a bit amateurish as they are done by no-name newcomers. I can fully believe that this was a troubled production and I don´t get how any of this cost 85 million to film. Gotham or most of the Marvel shows on Netflix honestly ""felt"" more expensive.

Don´t ask me where the Golden Tomato on RT came from as I struggled to enjoy myself despite being the target audience. The middling Metascore is way more accurate. I don´t necessarily think that the film derives to flop, which it actually might after the abysmal opening weekend, but I honestly don´t care for a sequel either. WB should have done a Gotham City Sirens starring Harley and a Birds of Prey film starring Batgirl instead with seasoned directors and writers. David Ayer and Jared Leto might get the last laughs here, lol. Good luck James Gunn, you might need it.

All in all the worst DC life action film since Green Lantern and I would have given the film a full point more if it wasn´t burdened by a cringe inducing narration that can´t stop. 5/10",5.0,10 February 2020
Save your 5.99 rental for... anything.,"The development of the Harley Quinn plot was an utter flop (once again) for Dc Comics. To develop Harley and build up the Birds Of Prey storyline of DC, this was a real disappointment. However, If you're down to watch a 2007 kung fu styled movie, with a decent cast... knock yourself out.

Fairly Entertaining,"The reviews on here are so toxic. A lot of negative reviews here are written by people who have an innate hatred against anything female. As a male I found the movie fairly entertaining. The movie is not trying to be cerebral or particularly thought provoking. It's pure flashy entertainment with a little bit of storytelling and as someone who was expecting the worst, found it an okay flick. It's really a 7/10 movie but I gave it 8/10 to offset all the idiot reviews on here.

The movie does a decent job in storytelling. It keeps the story non-linear while introducing new characters that come together at the end and that's not an easy task handling this many characters in a movie. It's done a respectable job in that aspects and kept the pace of the movie really well to keep things entertaining. It's no masterpiece but a movie worth watching for some entertainment on a boring night.",8.0,31 March 2020

"Ive never read the comics, not a DC fan really, and have never heard of Harley Quinn until Suicide Squad","The DC movies have mostly all been ""meh"" or lower in my eyes. Just not my favorite really. I have never read a comic book, but I do enjoy a lot of the super hero movies. So thinking that Suicide Squad was ok i figured i'd enjoy this enough to watch. Wow was I wrong........I played this movie for about 25 minutes, and shut it off. There was just SOOOO much bad in this short period alone that it wasn't tolerable. Margot Robie is pretty so there are points there, but theres not much worse than the stereotype NY accent. The story is a joke too....they don't take anything seriously. They couldn't even take the time to make jokes funny in this if they weren't going to write a real story. The woman cop and that singer just did me in. Such bad acting that I finally hung it up.

The big takeaway. The #1 thing in my head was feminism. You can tell that this was written by someone trying to force women empowerment down our throats. The women in this movie were all tough, witty, indestructable, perfect and in your face. The men were slow, lazy, stupid and are tripping all over themselves. I came into this not reading any reviews, checking scores, or having any expectations really. So a cringeworthy feminist approach being picked up this fast by me (again, 25 min in) is pretty horrible. Stay very far away!",1.0,25 March 2020

An upopular Review,"I don't know anything about the comics, and I didn't like suicide squad though Jared Leto is often good, and I liked Margot Robbie in it. So I started to watch this and I couldn't even get through an hour. Its very good that Hollywood recognizes that female directors have something to offer. There are many good ones out there including Katherine Bigelow who has made some awesome movies. There are many Chinese directors who are also very good and have had very successful careers. So what I don't understand is the need to pick someone who had only done one other feature film in her short career, an arthouse pic. Certainly there were more skilled and deserving Chinese women directors out there. The tone of the movie is all over the place. The action was so choreographed I felt like I was watching a dance recital. The frenetic pace seemed to be a symptom of bad story telling, not a method of story telling. This could have been a good movie and still hit all of the necessary societal undertones it wanted to. Movies can be fun and still have a message, even super/anti hero movies. This is definitely not one of them and I felt the failure lay in the director's chair.",2.0,19 August 2020

Badass women!,"Love the film! Finally we have badass women, who swear, drink, kick ass and support each other. The writing is brilliant.

"As a standalone story, it's ok, and Margot Robbie is the magic sauce","I'm not familiar with the harley Quinn 'canon', so am approaching Birds of Prey with an open mind. The story was a bit weak in places, but Margot Robbie's performance is the saving thread of the film. Not that her character's depiction was pitch perfect at all times, but it hit most of the notes and continuously saved the story. The other characters were pretty lame and more like props than characters, except for Rosey Perez who character was strong in the first half of the show and then faded back in the final act for some reason.

One could go scene by scene and nitpick what's there, or simply go with the flow and the ride.

Watch it for yourself!,"I don't base my reviews on other reviewers. I always like to watch the movies myself and make a informed decision. So for this movie, was it chaotic? Yes. Was it eccentric? Sure. However that's what they were going for. The whole point here was that this movie wasn't suppose to be just another hero or anti-hero movie. It was suppose to be off the wall, and strange in it's concept and execution.

Now onto the movie. First let me assure you that the reason why people think it's all over the place is because it is. The reason it appears this way is because it has no less then 3 flashbacks out of order, and a dream sequence that's a bit difficult to recognize until it's over.

Having said that, the actual movie was excellent. The acting was top notch, the story was more or less realistic from the mind of someone straight out of Arkham. I really enjoyed the quirky humor, because it wasn't too over the top, it was just the right amount of quirky mixed with a gallon of crazy(aka Harley's recipe). As for the rest of the birds of prey, they were there, and had some parts to play, but they were minimal because the focus was mostly around Harley and her antics.

All in all I give it a 8 out of 10, great vision, great writing, great acting, a bit discombobulated.",8.0,7 March 2020

Lets Pretend Suicide Squad Never Happened,"After the announcement of this movie and seeing a couple trailers, I admit I was super skeptical. After the ginormous dumpster fire that is suicide squad, I did not plan on seeing this movie if it had any relation. A friend of mine actually dragged me to it, and I have a happy to say I was delightfully surprised.

Not only was this nothing like suicide squad, but it made a 180 on the franchise. With a new director, writers, and much better plot, they actually tried on this one. With the oversaturation of superhero movies on our market today, it's really hard to make a winner. This did it for me.

From beginning to end, this movie was so much fun. Margot Robbie please the perfect Harley Quinn, and it was a smart choice to make her the lead role.

Because of the way they framed the trailers, I was worried it was another girl group ""feminist"" movie like Ghostbusters, but I was so wrong. It's Harley's story. It was a refreshing take on anti-heros. It did what suicide squad tried to do but it actually succeeded and being entertaining and not problematic.

The characters were well fleshed out, the plot was solid, the villains were captivating, the humor was balanced, it didn't pander to any kind of audience, and there was no major traditional Love story which is refreshing.

I could not have been more surprised and more thrilled with the outcome of this movie, especially coming from a mentality of wanting to distance myself from this genre.

If you have major doubts about this movie, you're justified. Go see it anyway. Trust me, you'll be just as surprised as I was.",8.0,14 December 2022

Gotham felt rooted in reality during the day yet became comic booky at night which was really fun. All of the actors brought their A game and we both can not wait until the Blu-Ray drops. I really hope people give this film a chance and appreciate the cinematic joy that it truly is. The soundtrack by the way is OFF THE HOOK and we're getting it.

"Perfect? No. But it's still a fun, crazy romp with some awesome performances.","First of all, Margot Robbie still proves that she was the perfect choice for Harley Quinn. Badass and hysterical, but with moments of genuine heart. Jurnee Smolett-Bell was an unexpected surprise. I love the TV show Black Canary so I was skeptical, but she was fantastic. One complaint I do have is that the movie felt like it was moving a little too fast at times. Another 30 minutes for character development and a few action scenes would have really improved things. And good lord, Ewan McGregor is just a treat. He hams it up in every scene and it's pretty clear he's having an absolute blast. He's intimidating and unpredictable but he never feels like he's trying to fit another villain's shoes.

Lastly, I think anyone who thinks this is a ""man-hating"" movie needs to seriously check their privilege. Women are the focus of the movie. That's the point.

Looks like a decent budget as well, what a total waste. How can so much continual action STILL put you to sleep?

Beautifully extravagent,"Birds of Prey: and the Fantabulous Emancipation of Harley Quinn is a great movie. The costuming for every character is gorgeous, the cinematography is colorful and fun. The fight scenes are entertaining and well choreographed (they used the same guy who did John Wicks fight choreo) and each character has a fighting style that is unique to them.

Margot Robbie did a fantastic job acting and producing this film and Cathy Yan did a fantastic job directing. The story might be considered a little basic, but it's easy to follow and is an all around great action movie.

Ewan McGregordid a great job as Black Mask and is terrifyingly charming and unhinged in the same scenes. And Chris Messina's Zsasz is creepy and well acted.

One of my favorite parts of the film were the supporting Birds of Prey. Huntress played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, with arguably the smallest part stole the show with her stilted social skills and rage issues. Jurnee Smollet bell as Black Canary was gorgeous and did a great job portraying the reluctant hero type. And Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya is fantastic as the disenchanted cop. The women are all well written three dimensional characters and I would just like to say Bravo to the cast and crew of this movie!

"Unbelievably disappointing, and this is coming from a registered ""liberal""","I've lived in Seattle for the last 15 years. My mother is ""bleeding-heart liberal"", and I suppose I'm some sort of half-breed. Here's the question I asked my mother towards the middle-end of this movie:

""Name me a single normal, regular, or redeemable man from this entire film""?

Not only could she not do it, but she was beside herself. Initially she tried to name the one man in the entire film who ""attempted"" to protect Harley but, minor spoiler, as I was in the middle of asking that question, 'said man' sold Harley out, for no reason, on screen, like it some sort of ongoing inside joke by the director. ""Whoopsies, did we accidentally write that a single man out of the 300 we've portrayed on screen wasn't a PoS tyrannical stereotype of pop misogyny? Let us just write-in a quick sequence of him betraying the protagonist, for no reason, so that we can maintain our undeniable certainty that all men are disgusting PoS, just as we wrote them!

Normally, this is when my mother and I would get into some kind of argument. ""They're just exaggerating the social narrative"", ""they're standing up against the patriarchy"" etc. But nope. Even my mother was like... you're right... ""you have to go out of your way to write an entire script, where every man in the entire film, is following a blatant-identity-politics, anti-male stereotype... and not a single one of them has any redeemable qualities (as if men 'or all men' needed to be ""redeemed"" in the first place"").

Her words, and I'm not lying, ""women don't need to be juxtaposed against an unrelenting stereotype of male tyranny and male misogyny in order to (prove) that they're competent, powerful, or deserving of admiration"".

For the love of god, I consider myself pretty ""center-leaning"". I often label my mother as ""when the left goes too far"", and even SHE agreed with me. She even referenced Wonder Woman as a wonderful example of a strong female role model who's entire story, script, acting, and directing don't need to rely on ""all men are bad"" in order to inspire young women (and men).

I'm a man who idolizes Margot Robbie and (especially) Mary Elizabeth Winstead. I look up to these wonderful actors and human-beings, and I'm at a loss trying to reconcile what I saw here. I'm not petty enough to hold this film against them (or anyone, besides the director and maybe writers perhaps?), but I am absolutely frightened that this received such high praise from the critics and audience, as if this was just a normal reality that we all accept and agree on.

Imagine a man writing a film where every single female character was a scathing, kniving, unreasonable, disgusting, evil, fragile, egotistical, horrific monster. You'd be shocked, but I guess it's normal when it goes the other direction? Is it reparations? Perhaps men are over-represented in film, but they (and the women who they work with) don't need to write their entire script at the expense of women. That would be... ridiculous (or I guess not?).""Being a man"" doesn't mean cutting-down women, in fact, it means the opposite.

Ultimately, I wasn't bored. However, it was hard to follow the thin-plot when the film kept jumping around from, men are bad, men are bad, men are bad, men are bad, women are tough, men suck, women can do things too didn't you know? men are bad, women are tough, men are bad, screw men, women are tough. I'm telling you. I don't need to hear about how all my ilk (who I don't know, and have nothing in common with besides an Y chromosome) are all evil, in order for you to substantiate yourself as a badass woman. In fact, in doing so, you've managed to paint a portrait of a bunch of petty women who can't even manage to get through a scene without dwelling on pop-culture identity politics. And my god, does that hurt, when you're seeing your personal heroes (love you, for your talent, Winstead) regurgitating these lines like it's reasonable (or...anti-sexist, when it's the exact opposite).

Long story short, I don't think I've ever been so disappointed by a movie (I paid to see) in my entire life. 84% of people on Rotten Tomatoes LOVED IT, because they consider frivolously anti-male identity politics the norm. They were able to watch a movie that had 5x as much social exposition as it did plot and say to themselves ""this is normal, I'm going to ignore it, and enjoy all the good bits in-between"". But, ""the good bits in-between"", were few and far-between, and the director and writer's very narrow-minded perspective let down what would have been an incredible movie that actually would have established The Birds of Pray as legitimate badasses, rather than their personal political mouthpiece. We get it, you were probably raised in Seattle too. I'm tired of hearing about it.",4.0,9 February 2020
Another good Margot Robbie performance filled with flat and uninteresting side characters.,"I will admit: Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as Harley Quinn. The fact that she even got her own movie after her debut in Suicide Squad (2016) is a testament to this. That being said, she's a bit of a shallow character past being ""Joker's girlfriend."" Look no further than Birds of Prey (2020) to see what I mean. If it were truly a Harley Quinn standalone film, it wouldn't have needed the sub-plots of a handful of other characters to make the running time long enough.

As it stands, Birds of Prey is meant as a sort of ""origin story"" for this titular team of female heroes. The fact that it needed Harley Quinn to make it marketable is a bit of a disappointment in the ability of the writers to create a story that would give these women agency without resorting to a tedious series of events that center around Harley surviving her vast list of enemies and people out for revenge. Unfortunately, none of the other characters stand out enough to make this movie as entertaining as it could have been.

Perhaps the overabundance of tropes and stereotype characters is what made this movie not work for me. None of the motivations of the characters are really that interesting or unique to them. It's almost like these characters were purposely chosen never to come close to taking the spotlight away from Harley Quinn, which hurts the overall film in the end. I'm certainly glad that I used a free Redbox rental for this movie, as I wouldn't want to spend any money on it.

Feminism & Superheroes,"This was yet another weak attempt of a female director (side note: with little to no directorial experience which was evident at times), at showing off an emancipated Joker-less Harley Quinn paired together with other characters who are being knocked around by the patriarchal society... I wont get into too much detail about that as it is more than obvious, but it was tasteless and boring with too much focus of breaking the men's knee caps.

I actually stopped watching after the scene that Harley knocks out Renee Montoya by kicking a phone to her head - and she is knocked out cold as if a brick hit her. This was just the cherry on the cake on top of the bad acting. Margot Robbie did the best she could and she saves the movie as much as she can - if it wasn't for her portrayal of the character I would've stopped watching even before 1st act ended.

Victor Zsazs' character was butchered as well; and Sionis was a cheap version of the Joker with no depth - just that he is on top of the patriarchal underground society...

Margot's Harley can't carry a film on her own,"First off Margot Robbie makes a good Harley Quinn. She plays the character perfectly. It seems as though those who made this film thought that was enough. There's precious little story told and the fight scenes ought to have had the ""pow"" and ""blam"" captions of the 60's Batman series as they were so badly choreographed it looked like they were aiming for the send up market. Having female leads, a female writer and a female director is not a substitute for a story worth telling. Harley Quinn comes across as strictly a sidekick rather than any main event and that ought to have been obvious right from the start.

Try starting with a decent script, get some stunt women who can fight and stop relying on a sidekick to carry the film in their entirety.",3.0,20 April 2020
I asked for Birds of Prey. I didn't asked for Harley Quinn.,"To Be Honest, it's more Harley Quinn & less Birds of Prey. It was exactly what I've expected. Quinn overshadowed the Huntress, Black Canary & Montoya. Besides decent action sequences & stellar performances from Margot Robbie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett, Rosie Perez & Ewan McGregor as Black Mask, This was a letdown (even the title was flat out ridiculous). No offense but Robbie's character should've went either her own solo film or a Gotham City Sirens film. It was the weakest film and the low point of the DCEU.

Please no more!,"Having watched both Suicide Squad movies recently and now this , I can now say I've had enough of Harley Quinn and her antics .

As good as Margot Robbie is , this film took me over the edge and I really struggled to get through it .

After splitting with the Joker, Harley Quinn joins superheroines Black Canary, Huntress and Renee Montoya to save a young girl from an evil crime lord.

The best thing about this film is the choreography of the fight scenes . They are incredibly well done but there is only so much of watching men being spun in the air or being kicked in the balls , I can take in one movie . It's absolutely relentless.

This is obviously a film that champions the female as all the main characters are women and all the bad guys are men.

That's fair enough but I do feel , because of this , it alienates half the population .

The only real male character is Roman Sionis who is played by Ewan McGregor, who can't act for love nor money .

If there is to be another film that solely relies on Harley Quinn then I won't be watching it.

Underrated Action-Comedy Pleasure,"Margot Robbie certainly delivers the fun, fresh and comical Harley Quinn in this fast action-comedy. However, if it weren't for how well constructed and pleasurable the idea of Birds of Prey turned out to be, it would've been known as terribly executed and forgettable. The story revolves around Harley Quinn joining superheroes Black Canary, Huntress and Renee Montoya after being dumped by the Joker, to protect a mischievous girl from the wacky villain, Black Mask (also known as Roman Sionis played by Ewan McGregor).

It's a pretty simple idea, but Birds of Prey ended up being an incredibly entertaining story with plenty of violent, silly action and enjoyable humour. Other than the entertainment value, another excellent element of this film is the characters. They're completely ridiculous and silly, but that's what's good about them. The lead superheroes, and villains, are fun and have well built personalities and looks.

There's also lots of skill, action and laughs throughout the movie, which is obviously what you expect from a recent action-comedy. But most action films today are tedious, flat and boring. Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn) is definitely a fun DC witness for teens and fans of other films like Suicide Squad. The storytelling and events the film provides are light-hearted but violent delight.

DC fans stay away.,"If you are DC comic fan purist, avoid like the plague. ""The Birds of Prey"" movie takes a different direction for the comic book.

Victor Zsaaz is bald in the comic. He had short blond/ white hair in the movie. The movie tries to take a different direction from ""Suicide Squad"" and make it an action comedy.

Misguided,"Having enjoyed Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad I was looking forward to seeing Birds of Prey. I am also a comic book/super hero fan so I was interested to see how they would portray the Birds of Prey. Whilst Margot Robbie was entertaining I think her character missed out on having some male counterparts to bounce off during the movie. She just became irritating after a while and you wanted more from Huntress and Black Canary. The character development was poor due to the plot and direction of the story. To suggest that these super heroes were joining together to save the girl was completely misleading. I live in Australia which is in the middle of a PC frenzy and left wing attitudes rule the airwaves and social media. This film is hailed as an achievement as it has female everything from production to cast. As a person who loves movies from Rom Coms to War I don't care whether the movie is all female, male or somewhere in between. I just want a great story that entertains.

For Film it is 7 but 1 added Star For The Stellar Performance By Margot Robbie As Harley Quinn,"From average to negative reviews and an underperformance at the box office, Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey is been unfortunate in every possible way, which is sad very very sad. DCEU is already struggling by every means whether its critical reception followed by their box office collection having couple of exceptions which is not just enough but for this particular movie I would say we've been little too harsh on Cathy Yan. This movie does deserve every praise in every possible way because in my experience the film is hilarious, joyful and entertaining. From direction to its cinematography including well-choreographed action and chase sequences along with some great background music including the background narration everything about this movie is highly enjoyable and above them all is the stellar performance of Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. She is Lunatic, she is Bad-Ass, she is Nerd, she is Emotional, she is Lovable, basically she is everything in the movie. Robbie's command over the character is just phenomenal. Em not a comic guy so I don't know that Harley Quinn is exactly a villain or a Super hero but either way I just fallen in love with her and the sheer credit goes to Margot Robbie, she is indeed one of the most versatile actresses of present time and after Harley Quinn I've totally fallen for her. I do agree with the point that Birds of Prey part was the secondary thing in the movie because the sole focus was on Harley Quinn's introduction and with Robbie's outstanding performance Birds of Prey gets totally shadowed but that doesn't really mattered for me because I got the hell of a ride within 1hour and 48mins and the fact is I couldn't really get over the Harley Quinn.

Does the idea of an all-female Deadpool 2 reboot excite you?,"Then you'll probably like this movie fine. Granted, it's not an exact comparison, but the humour, plot elements, character archetypes, themes, even editing decisions are all reminiscent, and for me, it was at the point of distraction. When they were directly copying beats from Deadpool, it felt shoehorned in. The only thing that it doesn't quite copy, oddly enough, is how graphic the violence can be. This movie could be PG-13, and not lose much. It's not necessarily a bad direction: after all, DC has been criticized in the past for being too dark and edgey, and taking itself so seriously. Shazam and Aquaman have started to turn the tides a little.

If you're a casual fan of DC, then you'll likely recognize these characters from shows like Gotham or Arrow, but if you're completely new to this universe, this movie does a great job of summarizing their backstories. One of the largest flaws with Suicide Squad were too many characters with so little time devoted to them that they were difficult to keep track of, let alone form legitimate connections to them. Fortunately, DC learns from their previous endeavours, and responds to their fanbase, which I think is really cool.

Returning from Suicide Squad is Harley Quinn: the Joker's right hand woman. Coming back to this universe after the Joker's solo outing is a little jarring, but Margot Robbie fits the role like a glove. I like the scenario that they gave us. I'm sure it's been explored many times in other media, but I thought that it felt natural to the characters, to the world: it was a great set up, and it was, at least to me, very reminiscent of a comic book in how that aspect was portrayed.

This is also an origin story for the Birds of Prey. We've had a lot of superhero origin stories as of late, and this one is pretty unconventional. Kind of (but not really) like watching X-Men Origins from the point of view of one of the guys they saved. Because so much of this movie is centered on Harley, and granted, she ties most of the cast together, but the core character of each Bird of Prey is a joke, or follows an aspect of patriarchy, with the exception of Cassandra Cain. Badass motorcycle riding crossbow wielding mafia princess? A complete try hard. A cop who's accomplishments have gone uncredited for years struggling to serve her city due to the lack of an encouraging work environment? Only speaks in 80s cop dialogue. Backstories that could have been interesting feel especially glanced over. Again, at least these characters have recognizable character traits, unlike Suicide Squad. Honestly, I don't even mind their portrayal all that much: the actors do a great job of making their characters feel deeper than the writing allows. It's a way to weave humour in, and allows non-Harley portions to be slightly more engaging, instead of one note slogs. I connected to some characters more than Harley, and though I would have loved to learn more, I think anything extra would have been detrimental to the flow of the movie. What it is works fine.

The movie will halt the story to go back in time to exposit plot information. Having a character as our narrator, it feels a little less awkward than it could have. Some of it feels redundant, and there's one inconsistency that really bugged me throughout, but you're not going to get lost in this story: it's pretty straightforward stuff.

Ewan McGregor is a fantastic actor. His character, on paper, is the blandest villain archetype that you will ever see, with no real motivation, and no surprises. But he does a great job: there are moments with him, one or two in particular, that make you feel genuinely uncomfortable.

It's colourful, the fight sequences are fun. The biggest goal of this movie was to be a female empowerment piece. There's a lot of danger to be had in that, a lot of scrutiny that the movie is putting itself under. It's not a great thing when you have to point out ""Look how progressive we're being!"", or demonizing half the population to make the other half look more in the right. It's very understandable if you get sick of it. The goal is equity, but examples of that are hard to come across in feature film.

Here are a couple of things that I liked in that regard:


We should always strive to judge something for what it is, not for what we want it to be. Is this a great film? No. But everyone I went with had the same reaction: ""Huh. That was better than I thought."" It's not a long film, and the hour and a half isn't completely devoid of anything worthwhile. I probably won't be watching again, but I can't get as angry or hateful as some of the other reviews.

You know what does make me angry? There are screenshots going around the internet of fans of this movie attacking the Sonic movie (which isn't even out as of writing) for having racial and homophobic slurs, allegedly in an attempt to keep Birds of Prey at the top of the box office. Some of them are jokes. Some are not.

If you're one of those fans who are seeking validation, you're not going to find it here. Likely nothing in this review will change your viewpoint, but these actions go against the entire aspiration for Birds of Prey: striving for a better world in which working together, and supporting each other are normalized behaviours.

Films are art, and each person should be entitled to their own interpretation, but it's always better to give it a fair shot first. It's sad when films are bogged down by controversy, especially when it's something so petty, and it's going to leave far more of a bad taste and impact Birds of Prey more than anything in the film's runtime.",5.0,13 February 2020

I could care less if her face gets ripped off by the villain... and the villain for that matter...Ewan I love him as an actor as well but he doesn't do a great villain ... he's just not scary ... maybe he wasn't meant to be scary? Best part of the movie was the hyena we need more of the hyena ...,4.0,14 May 2020
"Awful all around, despite another strong Margot Robbie performance","Robbie is always entertaining, and brings charisma and scene-stealing energy to her work, but her portrayal in this fell so far short of Suicide Squad 2016 that I'm just flabbergasted. Gone is that rich Long Island accent, the garish and vulgar persona, all of the evil charm that made the 2016 character so memorable. This one's watered down, uninteresting, dull. Such a shame, considering that they already had a rich foundation to build on.

The movie doesn't lack for Hollywood production values, great colours and sets, great costumes, but it's just so poorly made - the director fails thoroughly to extract any nuance, any essence, any truth from her scenes, it plays so flat, so uninventive, so boringly. A movie you can watch half-asleep and not miss a thing. She tries to do a sort of Guy Richie in cuts and style, and flashbacks, with layered stories, but just doesn't pull it off. It's just hackneyed, dull, very mediocre work.

And to believe that this was meant to have an overtly political message! Just unbelievable. There's zero politics in the movie, there's no structure to it to suggest anything relatable or insightful, that could possibly draw the audience in. In contrast, even the most commercial Hollywood movies are able to rise to the level of philosophical and emotional essay, where they connect with deep and resonant human ideas or themes. This movie never hits a single high point of any kind. Just awful!

Inexplicable that it has 6 stars on IMDb, deserves at best a 5, so giving it a 1 to help offset the nonsensical reviews it seems to have gotten. I just wonder if having a female director, screenwriter and protagonists is enough for some to justify its entertainment value, simply the political symbolism of that arrangement. Not for me - there are remarkable female writers and directors out there, who deserve to be recognised for their work and not because of their gender. In this case, the team disappoints thoroughly, and fails to make a statement of any kind, good or bad.",1.0,12 August 2021
I loved It,"I was excited for this movie ever since it was announced, and it lived up to my expectations, the movie was great, Margot knocked it out of the park with a sensational performance, she proved again why she is one of the best!

Soooooo slow and drawn out,"None of the characters are very strong, the story is unnecessarily drawn out. Harley should've been a more self confident, crazy character who should've been smarter and had more of a sense of control (even in situations where she's not) e.g even in bad situations the joker would always laugh it off, he was never sorry for himself or fearful.

Much Better Than Suicide Squad,"Make no mistake here - this movie is way too different from Suicide Squad - Birds Of Prey is funnier, wittier, more deeply sarcastic, faster in pace, grittier and much more entertaining. Hugely entertaining. With Margot as Harley Quinn constantly breaking the fourth wall and making the funny flick even funnier, it is one delight of a watch. Excellent casting (Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a huge plus), fast tempo, awesome soundtrack and great sense of humor build up an outstanding suspense and it all leads to a mighty final. A large improvement and a great hope that all possible sequels will be better after that",10.0,22 March 2020
Okay way to pass a couple hours.,"Frenetic action and humor compete with disjointed storytelling and lackluster performances. Margo Robbie does a great job of showing depth and multiple facets of a woman scorned with a screw loose. Ella Jay Basco came out pretty strong for her first feature film role. Kurnee Smollett-Bell gave a believable performance and became a likeable character for me. Ewan McGregor was a little over the top, as would be expected for a DC villain. There were some humorous moments, mainly slapstick with a small amount of witty banter. Character development seemed like an afterthought. The story arc was confusing. Rosie Perez's character was extremely clichéd, but this almost seemed like a tongue in cheek, self aware gag. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance was flat and forgettable. Chris Messina was nowhere near the mark for his character, and left me confused and disappointed.",5.0,10 February 2020
Dope.,"I really liked Birds of Prey. I don't know why most of the people didn't like it because it's pure entertainment. Margot Robbie just rocked as Harley Quinn again and she proved that she's born to play this one of the best comic book character. Where the movie really wins is that she's not the only one who shined. All other characters like Black Mask, Black Canary, Huntress, Renee Montoya, Cassandra Cain and Victor Zsasz also stole the show and got enough space to shine. Yes, the story lacks some depth but it was not horrible as many people say. It's funny, gory and super entertaining. This is one of the best DCEU movie and DC films are on a good streak. I'm disappointed that this movie didn't make a lot of money in the box office. Overall, BoP is an awesome comic book based movie and a real entertainer. This movie also proves that DCEU is so much different from MCU and they can never make movie like BoP. Waiting for more from like this from DC.",8.0,22 March 2020
"Nice action, bland characters","Rather than 'Birds of Prey', this is especially a Harley Quinn solo movie. She is definitely the best part about it and Margot Robbie does yet another great performance in an otherwise lacking film. Most of the characters besides Harley were boring, I didn't care at all for the others heroes and even the villain was weak. Where this movie excels, other than Harley, is the action. It has some very nice choreography compared to other superhero movies. The genre is general lacks entertaining fight scenes, so I'm glad to see it proper utilized.",5.0,24 September 2021
big disappointment,"Gave 3 stars just for the sake of Margot. There is no need to make a detailed review about the movie that ""everything"" except her was incredibly horrible.

Put a smile on my face after a bad day,"I went to watch this movie on Valentine's day and not going to lie I wasn't in the best mood, but regardless went to watch it with my friend.

This movie is for those who like action scenes and want to have a laugh.

The whole theater was laughing through the whole movie. Different jokes were effective on different people but most made everyone laugh out loud.

I read reviews saying this movie was ''messy'' considering the storytelling, but that's because Harley did the storytelling throughout the movie. It made it more interesting.

Margot Robbie's acting and portrayal of Harley Quinn is what made this movie really enjoyable as well.

Birds Of Prey was a movie I'll watch again",8.0,15 February 2020
"Worst DC movie by far, only made it 45 minutes in before calling it a wrap","Due to the Synder Cut being released, I decided to delve into the DC 2010's Universe for the first time. Superman was good, Wonder Woman was amazing, Batman Vs Superman directors cut was great, Synder Cut of Justice League was legendary, and Aqua man was good.

Suicide Squad was pretty bad, but not as awful as I thought it would be.

This though? This is just awful. Margot Robbie is great and that is all that is even watchable in this movie. The writing is awful. It's just a terrible movie.",2.0,8 April 2021
LOVED it!!,"I loved this movie! The characters were interesting and the movie explained their backstories well. The flight scenes were very interesting, not the typical sort of choreography we see in a lot of films. The fighting felt like some sort of gymnastics/ dance/ fight combo- it was great! Yes, every man in the movie let the main character down so it was a bit anti male. However that is what made it interesting- it was from Harleys perspective, she had just broken up with the love of her life, obviously she is going to not love the male race. The sets and costumes were amazing! Someone had written in one of these reviews that Harleys outfits were ugly. Harley is no longer dressing to please/ impress a man. Yes her clothing was out there and crazy- the character herself is very out there! Overall I loved it!",9.0,17 February 2020
DC hasn't learned its lesson,"Damn. This movie is really bad. It doesn't know how to adapt any of the new characters and does what it thinks it may work but it actually doesn't. The story is all messed up for the unnecesary reason of telling it in disorder. The action scenes are decent but not enough for them to be good. I actually wish they erase this film from canon, so that they can actually make something good with Huntress, Black Canary, Orphan (Cassandra Cain) and Black Mask. It is the worst DCEU movie, even worse than Suicede Squad. Harley Quinn is the only good thing and isn't actually that good.",5.0,3 March 2022

One of the best movies I've seen in some time,,10.0,23 February 2020
"Terrible, forgettable, blah","Here's a few reasons why: number one is that this is a story that takes place in Gotham City, yet there's no Gotham in this movie at all. Generally the story is ok- not great, but ok. Casting is ok but all the headliners seem to be phoning it in. Supporting cast is great. Margo is meh, but that may be more the writing of her character and directing than how she's playing it. (Honestly I was never in love with her Harley to begin with so bare that in mind.) The haphazard action scenes around Quinn are pretty good, but they lack something I can't quite pinpoint- the narrative aspect of this film may be the biggest mistake holding it all back as it lacks the wit required to pull off this method of story telling- idk the charm just isn't there for me.

Is it an anti-man anthem? Meh... if you want to read it that way I guess you could, but it's not over the top so. It does go from one cliche to another in that respect which really betrays the story and Quinn's character. Quinn is chaos and carefree, that's her thing- she is the female Joker. That's why they're a pair. However not in this movie. Here Harley is more of a secret mastermind, yet a mastermind of nothing really. It seems like the writers didn't have a solid concept of the character.

Now, the fight scenes: okay, kinda cool, kinda bad-ass... But really contrived, mostly out of place and serve no purpose to the story or characters at all. It's like they just rummaged through a bunch of old comics looking for pictures to create fight scenes around and then forced them into a film they didn't want to write. There's not one moment of hazard to our main character, not really.

In short there is nothing extra about this movie. It feels in every way like a movie a few friends made without any consideration of a larger audience. I could go in to spoilers but why? There's so little of this movie that feels fresher than an old sock already.

Number one issue: this isn't Gotham in any way. It's a generic punk movie with zero character development and not much more plot.

I've been writing this whole thing while in the back of my mind trying to remember the name of the main bad guy (actor) in this film. You know who he is. You might even think he's a great actor- and he has been at times. But honestly he and his character in this film are so insignificant that I can not recall his name. And really that's the feel of this whole experience.",4.0,31 March 2021

Not Good. Not Bad. Somewhere between both.,I really disliked it when movie started but movie started getting it's momentum slowly and it was okay at the end. There were some good scenes but major missing elemen was.. Harley's Craziness.,5.0,30 July 2020
Birds of Prey...,"""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" is an Action - Crime movie in which we watch Harley Quinn joins superheroes Black Canary, Huntress and Renee Montoya after her break up with Joker. They have to cooperate all together in order to save a young girl from a vicious crime lord.

I have to admit that I expected more from this movie and unfortunately I was a bit disappointed by it. I also expected it to be better than ""Suicide Squad"" but it was not. The direction which was made by Cathy Yan was not the best and she did not present very well all the characters in the movie, something that created some plot holes. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, Margot Robbie who played as Harley Quinn was good but I believe that she did not reach her true potential, Ewan McGregor who played as Roman Sionis was very good and Mary Elizabeth Winstead who played as Helena Bertinelli / The Huntress was equally good. Finally, I have to say that ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" is neither the best movie nor the worst movie, it's just another average movie.",5.0,24 May 2020

Super Fun Action Film with Women,"I had a blast watching this movie. I love DC and grew up on the animated shows, my favorites were probably Teen Titans and Batman Beyond. For the last decade or so I've watched people go googoo-gaga for Marvel movies and I tried to stay excited but I got burnt out. I'm glad to see DC fighting back with their own movies. Especially with more characters than just Batman and Superman remakes over and over. Not that I don't love to sit back and rewath all the different Batman remakes too.

This movie let's the characters have fun, it definitely reminds me of a lot of the humor that I loved in the first Deadpool. So if you are a Marvel fan then come in thinking it's most in style of Deadpool. I also have no idea why I see reviews of people saying the violence is played down, I laughed so hard during an explosion that blew a guy apart that another person in the theater felt the need to comment afterward. So, yeah, snapped legs, people literally blown to bits, etc.

It's funny, the action is amazing and you'll enjoy yourself. Especially if you make sure there aren't any sticks up when you sit down to watch it. Don't forget that Batman has been beating up bad guys for decades and no one has complained about that.",10.0,15 February 2020

Crap,"The only reason I went to this movie was to see Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress and she's the only character who has a proper motive and can practically take down big men.

The story, writing, atmosphere, jokes, characters and everything else was bs. The fights would've definitely been terrible if it wasn't for Chad Stahelski.

She's just a joker punching bag. They also ruin Cassandra Cain. One of the best combatants of all of comics, and they make her a tiny thief. Character ruined.

Yes there is an underlying message but in a world where women can stand up to the Harvey Weinstein of the world, you are going to see these dogs and if you don't like it well then your probably a Harvey Weinstein yourself.

Entertaining little sprint,"It seems like DCEU has found the correct path if their intention is to continue the MCU type shared universe.

Speaking of the movie, I really enjoy the entire movie.There are good action sequences through out the movie with the killer soundtrack which I really enjoy. The soundtrack is really great.It is one of the plus points of the movie. And the best thing is Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. Its literally the fantabulous emancipation of one (and only) Harley Quinn. May be the main title of the movie about Birds of prey. But to me its more about Harley Quinn, the anti heroine. That doesn't mean its bad, not at all.Using well established crowd loving character to build up a all women super team is a great idea. Plus all other characters also portrayed well by the actresses

I didnt talk about the villain (or the villains) didnt I? Thats the biggest problem I found out in the movie. If Black Mask could have been a little bit challenging to the not yet established group of young (in experience for some of them) heroines, the movie would have been perfect. So far in the DCEU, the villains devision has been good.They are worthy villains for the heroes(except steppenwolf for Superman). Otherwise the movie is worth for your time.

What a Waste Money,"After her painful breakup with Joker, Harley Quinn finds herself all alone and a long winded and boring twisted tale told by Harley Quinn herself begins. You would expect action from the very start. We already know who Harley Quinn is from Suicide Squad but she explains who she is it all over again from back to front and front to back. You'd want the other characters Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya's paths to collide at the very start of the movie to make it a action movie. But they seem more like cameos during the movie and with only 20 mins till the end of the movie, the unlikely foursome have no choice but to team up to bring down Gotham's Narcissistic Villain Roman (Black Mask) and his thugs.",2.0,2 April 2021
"A hilarious, pulse-pounding hootenanny of the highest caliber.","I don't like reading other reviews when forming an opinion, but glancing at the ones here... jeez. IMDb users sure are flinging a lot of shade at this ""woke, anti-men PC"" flick.

Well, that's a bunch of bull and makes me question how many of those reviewers have even seen it. For one, the film makes no big deal at all out of its heroes' genders, but two... egads, the action! How could one watch this movie and not gush about the blisteringly inventive choreography? I lost track of how many fights there are, but there are a few prolonged setpieces that got the very small crowd at my theater hollering like it was a packed house.

Some fights remind me of a very darkly humorous take on Jackie Chan's work, and honestly, I'd say it has some of the most entertaining fight scenes I've seen since his 80s Hong Kong heydey.

The soundtrack is another standout, and the film is often quite in sync with it (akin to Baby Driver), which made for some really groovin scenes. And I can't end this review without mentioning Ewan McGregor, whose madcap, unhinged performance as a gangster who just wants to have a really good time is an absolute delight. He lights up the screen and owns every second he's in.

I'm not the biggest fan of comic book movies (I've seen everything from Marvel and a couple DC films), but Birds of Prey is one of the most fun times I've ever had in a theater. Count me interested in anything Cathy Yan makes going forward... doubly so if it's another action-comedy.",9.0,11 February 2020
Got better things to do with my time.,"She had a bad NYC accent, and the music was as annoying as most of the scenes. Plenty of questionable moral content, like being a cocaine sniffing, violent sociopath is cool. Ok for (most) adults that can discern, but if that was the target audience, they missed the mark with this Ritalin addled teenage girl fun fest, mess.

This film's too base to have any agenda, so all the people talking about 'all men are bad' are are just repeating an inane argument someone somewhere made. It appears to me that all bad guys in movies are mostly men, and mostly bad. Or they wouldn't be bad guys.

Big pointless mess,"A big mess from the movie, like they had no idea what to do. The film was supposed to be called Harley Quinn because it really has nothing to do with Birds of prey. Harley is the central and main character of the whole film and practically the only positive thing. The other characters are irrelevant, unimportant and do not have a good story behind them and characterization. The main villain is the caricature itself, it is neither funny nor scary. The whole movie wasn't funny to me at all or anything particularly entertaining. By far the worst DC movie on my list. What is the point of this movie anyway?",3.0,27 August 2021

This movie was a blast!,"Wasn't really a Harley Quinn fan Going in, but I am now. This is a great movie with some confusion and minor plot issues.

Great fight choreography, Some really solid and enjoyable acting performances by its various stars. The soundtrack is rocking, it's funny, action packed, and some awesome scenes (the fight in the police station is worth it for admission alone).

In the negative column, the plot at times feels a little confused, and not in the sense that this is Harley Quinn being an unreliable narrator, in the sense that they had some issues figuring out what they were doing. But it really doesn't detract from the my enjoyment of the movie.

The birds of prey were kind of robbed as this is definitely a Harley Quinn movie first. Huntress in particular needed more screen time.

But again, this movie was a lot of fun. Looking at the negative reviews people have left (one and two stars) I wonder what the hell movie they were watching. But it wasn't this one. I don't often re-see a movie in theaters anymore, and I would absolutely pay to see this again (and may)",8.0,8 March 2020
terrible movie.. waste of time. Read the script wiki!,"Birds of Prey: is more than horrible. It should not exist. Money should never have been raised for it. The screenplay should never have been filmed. Margot Robbie shouldn't have produced it. She certainly shouldn't have starred in it.

positive aspects: some songs and one or two action sequences... Final verdict one of the worst superhero movies made!",1.0,3 August 2020
The Incels HATE This!,"This won't be a long or analytical review, because I don't have the time. This movie sets out what it needs to, it's entertaining, funny, brilliantly choreographed, and aesthetic as hell!

Margot Robbie pulls off a brilliant performance as the unhinged Harley Quinn, it's also about time that a movie recognised that she's smart too.

The soundtrack is unforgettable, I haven't been able to stop listening to it.

A lot of people on here say it's all man-hating but it's not, it's just hating on one (1) man, like every other 'superhero' film. The incels on here are also calling it a chick flick, because there's a woman in it I guess. The thing is, most people on IMDB just really hate main female characters, so I would take these reviews with a pinch of salt.

At the end of the day, it's a good and entertaining movie. Is it perfect? No, obviously not. But it's fun and brilliant just the same.",10.0,14 February 2020

"Original, Funny and Exciting","Birds of Prey continues DC winning streak and cementing DC and WB as movie studios allowing directors to bring their own vision to the table and going all out. This movie could easily have been PG-13 minus a few violent fight scenes but the fact that the studio didn't bother to alter them to PG-13 is awesome. Now coming to the movie I liked for the most part and was conflicted when it comes to a few areas. The movie can be called a sequel to Suicide Squad which focuses on Harley Quinn after she broke up with the Joker. Now why the movie is called Birds of Prey I don't know because Harley Quinn is definitely the front and centre and the other characters shows up from time to time and team up towards the end. The movie is told completely through Harley Quinn perspective and is narrated by her thus the sequences of event that happened in the movie are a little out of sequence showing the chaos in her mind, It shows very well the chaos in Harley Quinn's mind but I think kills the excitement and build-up of a few scenes. The comedy is very quirky and organic which I love in contrast to the one forced upon. The action scenes are very well done and are exciting except for the last action sequence, It didn't do much for me and I was feeling bored towards the end of the movie. The cinematography was great and some sequence really popped, the soundtrack was great as well. The actors here have done a phenomenal job especially Margot Robbie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ewan Mcgregor and Chris Messina. Margot Robbie is the definitive Harley Quinn and each of her sequences lifted the movie. Ewan did a great job although I wished I had seen something more from the character than we got. Huntress was an interesting character but we didn't get much in this movie and Victor Zsasz was menacing. In all I really liked the movie except maybe the last 20 minutes, I am excited to see Harley Quinn and Birds of Prey in future movies.",9.0,7 February 2020

"Quinn a ""Grateful rebel"" instead of Anarchistic.","The angle they're coming from is completely wrong. Margot Robbie plays it as a ""grateful rebel"", instead of actually anarchistic (wide awake, following your hearts desires).

Daniel Bernhardt, who plays the first ""casualty"" (1 min into the film), is a far better actor than anyone else in the film and he was the first to go. The comments afterward about it were slack jawed.

10/10 cheff's kiss*,"Now this is what a DC film should be, best they've done since Watchman! It portrayed the grittiness of Gotham city way better than other DC films and the fighting scenes were incredibly directed and a visual master piece! This film was brilliant from start to end and had the same chaotic energy and excitement as what a good Harley Quinn film should be(the version of her in suicide squad was a pathetic attempt which was far too focused on the male gaze and had no substance what so ever!!). Sure, the black mask could have been more menacing but considering how many other villains there were, I don't think it's that huge of a deal in the grand scheme of the film. From the writing to the directing, to the brilliant soundtrack and cast, this film outdid my expectations!

I'm not offended that it was sexist but I do find it hypocritical for feminists to complain about sexism and then make a sexist movie. Stop messing with the originals. That's The Joker's chemical plant. It's only a side note that Harley Quinn came out of there. And she fell in love with him at the asylum, by the way.

"All wrapping, no present","Having broken up with The Joker and therefore losing her immunity from vengeful low-lifes, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) finds herself targeted by grudge-holders and ends up in a search for a diamond that holds the key to a mob fortune. Despite being promoted as a 'team' movie (perhaps in the wistful hope of kick-starting a B-lister movie or TV franchise), the film focusses almost exclusively on the Joker's loopy ex, who gets most of the best material. The simplistic plot serves only to launch action sequences and the script comes off like a series of punchlines with insufficient setup. Nothing in the film is clever or original - for better or worse, fans of the genre will have seen it all before (the climatic fight at the decrepit funhouse has all the garish stupidity of Joel Schumacher's abysmal 'Batman and Robin' (1997)). As main villain Roman Sionis, Ewan McGregor (who deserves better material) trots out yet another 'over-the-top jolly psycho' who, despite a number of grim scenes, fails to be menacing in the least (especially after donning his silly looking skull mask). I appreciate that these films need play in part to the fans of the comic books, so many of the details and subtexts may have been lost on me, but I found the film repetitive, boring, and derivative. On the plus side, the CGI effects are outstanding (most notably the hyena). If only the stories and scripts could catch up to the visuals, we might see some D.C./Marvel adventures that are worthy of all the hype.",5.0,15 February 2021

Harley Quinn mad head is a new form of art,"I got to say, I wasn't expecting much of this movie. Even When the firsts reviews came out I still had some caveats about It. Seeing the BOP history from Quinn's perspective was something... unusual, but in a very positive way, because we can connect with this character in a very unique way, in which not only we can see how they are in a group, but as unique individuals, and for me, It's a new way to make movie. The movie will only be good if you buy what it is selling: Quinn's mad head. If you can buy that, the movie flows just perfectly. On the technical details BOP are very good, with the biggest highlight to the soundtrack, which fits perfectly with Harley's crazy narrative. Another highlight is the cast chemistry, seeing the BOP together is one of the most awesome parts of the movie and Ewan Mcgregor version of Black Mask is great, It really represents how a misogynist man is. The script also discuss femininity in a very touching way, in which we can see routine female problems applied to her reality, and, again, perfect. Last but not least, Cathy Yan direction is also amazing, not only on the camera moving, but also in coordinating the cast. My only caveats are in Rosie Perez and Ella Jay Basco performance, which are not on the level of the rest of the cast, making all the scenes they are alone really boring. Also with the costumes, which are really weird. And the scenario is really different of what we are used to see in Gotham, so It takes sometime to get used to It. My advice? Go to the theater and watch it",9.0,10 March 2020

McGregor as the over the too bad guy (is that snot?) was well done. Yeah he's a bit one dimensional but shows that one side in all it's facets. Proper performance from him.

The bits where neither were on screen the movie felt very flat. The story of the cop wasn't needed and added nothing. I'll make an exception for Winsteads performance, she did alright.

Hands-down the most fun DC movie,"Birds of Prey is a fun-house ride, a sassy chick-flick for the dudes and a stylish romp that comes together with Margot Robbie reprising her Harley Quinn scene-stealing role. It's exaggerated and violent (like every good action picture) but with incredible use of color and style and spot-on incorporation of tunes. The stunts are fantastic and done really well. Margot Robbie continues to improve her star power by amping up the wattage here; Ewan McGregor has a boat-load of fun with his Black Mask character; and the rest of the posse of girls has just enough to do to keep them in the picture, although I don't think they were as fleshed-out as they could have been. I loved this picture as did the vast majority of the audience in the theatre when I saw it. I don't think the marketing did the movie justice, unfortunately, and the title is ridiculously long when it doesn't need to be. And yes, the editing makes it overly confusing going back and forth until finally settling into the story. But it's a riotous mess that ultimately works.

If you gave $84 million to a precocious 17 year-old film student...,"... and then asked him to make a movie for a 15-year old audience. I imagine the movie would not be bad if you are in that category, but if you are over the age of 20 this is a real let down.

It could have been good with a great cast, nice sets, good color grading, but the wardrobe was bad, the script was bad, the great actors were BADLY directed and wasted and Margot really needs to hit the gym for a couple weeks before a movie like this, she looks way to soft to be an action figure. I am not saying you have to be in shape to be an actress, but if you are going to play an action super hero, you should look like you at least run around the block once or twice a month.

"Another ""Meh"" DC movie","Why is it that DC is unable to make good movies? Apart from one or two notable exceptions most of them range from ""boring"" to ""Ok"" and so does this one. This movie wants to be Deadpool. It wants it soooo bad, but it fails. It's rated R, but it still looks and feels more like Batman and Robin than Deadpool. This seems to be another movie that doesn't know if it wants to be campy and fun, or gritty with dark humour, so they went ""Why not both?"" and the result is this. Now, to be honest, Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey are characters I know little about, apart from the comics I vaguely recall a TV series about them, so I haven't got any relationship with the characters that might have helped me enjoy this movie more. Fans of the characters might see things differently. All in all, it's a movie that didn't manage to keep my interest, but there are some pretty colours in it and I didn't turn it off in disgust (Did start to read a book to keep myself entertained while I watched it, though), so I'll give it 4/10.",4.0,1 April 2020

The complaints on the movie just don't seem all the valid at times. I've notice however that this sight tends to have people who leave reviews no more than about 8 stars as finding a nine star is difficult.

If you're familiar with Harley Quinn, particularly Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley Quinn, you should have an idea of what to expect, but I'd like to think the film shattered many expectations. What I enjoyed the most about this film is its departure from DC's trend of dreary superhero movies; the film is bright, upbeat, and has a sense of humor.

Favorite DC Film!,"Margot Robbie is back as Harley Quinn and is front in center. Following the events os Suicide Squad we see Harley after breaking up with Mr. J as she goes out in Gotham on her own. This film is colorful, fun, action-packed and absolutely hilarious. I see a lot of people criticize this movie's choice to tell it's story. The film jumps around as it gives you information for the scene your about to see. I personally loved this choice because it really put you in the mind of Harley Quinn. I loved when the film freeze framed and would show chaotic vandalism-like drawing over the frame (presumably written by Harley). It just helps put you in her mind. Also this direction of story telling was also in Deadpool and people praised that film (because it's amazing) and didn't even bring up how it told it's story in such a chaotic way. Honestly, the chaotic story telling works better with the character of Harley Quinn anyways because she's a psychopath. I love Deadpool, I think it's absolutely incredible I just don't think it's fair to hate on BOP for it but turn the other way when it comes to Deadpool

Some good amongst some bad!,"So a 5 out of 10 is just about worth a watch if on TV already & if you in the mood for an ""action packed not taking itself too seriously film"" with some good choreographed fight scenes, as yes you hope for much more but you get about your expectations.

I always feel with a movie like this if the movie makers took it more serious like the Christian Bale Batman films & concentrated on a better more logical storyline they could have then made a really great movie, however they chose not to go this route which is a real shame as a much better more believable script would have been a possibility. I think the actors & director needed a much better screen play script.

Harley Quinn's character is literally ""crazy"" like the Joker character ( Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson or even Cesar Romero all were believable in their Batman worlds ). So the point is Harley Quinn can be 100% outlandish so long as everyone else acts how they would do in a normal world then you could really appreciate such a film. So if like the original Batman series with Adam West you can have more family friendly characters, but with Birds of Prey it is a 15 rated movie so as fans we want something more like The Dark Knight 2008 as we want something that could then in theory cross over the best DC film genres, however Birds of Prey is not up to it.

I personally did not like the film Joker 2019 but that was not Joaquin Phoenix fault, as again it is down to the script ( as others loved it so good for them ) but again we as fans want to see cross over films that are quality adult entertainment but so far let's say most of these DC films are just not as Marvellous ( pun intended ) as they should be. Only the Christian Bale Batman 2005 to 2012 trilogy is truly top notch & now I see in 2022 this great actor is starring in Marvel's Thor: Love & Thunder, which is a good indicator of where the best actors are finding the best scripts.

It is time the makers of DC films had a serious rethink as they have the potential to be as good as Marvel films but they have to start by getting a truly great script for a movie & making sure they then have a great director & actors to make it great.",5.0,12 February 2021
Give me Harley's Angels over Charlie's Angels anytime,"My Review- Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn) or as it's been renamed Harley Quinn Birds of Prey My Rating 9/10 DC Comic hero or heroine movies even if MA15+ are not my usual movie preference but I'd go and see any movie that Margot Robbie is starring in. I'd read a bit of negative gossip about that this film and that it had been poorly marketed so I left it for a few weeks but what a wonderful surprise. I loved the Comic/Carnival atmosphere of this movie it reminded me a little of Baz Luhrman's approach of Colour and Action I don't know if Director Cathy Yan was inspired by Moulin Rouge but Bird's of Prey especially in the Roman Sionis Nightclub scenes reminded me of Baz Luhrman. Yes it does have some violent moments but most are tongue in cheek like Harley 's shoot out scene at Police Headquarters not the conventional high powered assault guns but a pop gun with bullets that explode with confetti. There are so many reasons I liked Birds of Prey primarily Margo Robbie who I commented recently has that rare quality of having a love affair with the camera lens . As Harley Quinn she glistens and shines her Screen presence is magnetic like Marilyn Monroe who gets a Margo Robbie tribute in this movie .Margo Robbie who is also a Producer of this film gives this once ""significant other "" now The Joker's ex girlfriend a villainous vengeful but absolutely loveable personality . Harley Quinn guides us through her rise to infamy with funny narration and comic book captions which add to the fun . Harley wears fabulous costumes and makeup that reminded me of Cyndy Laupers video for ""Girls Just Wanna have Fun "" maybe an accident but very appropriate for this fun film. I knew nothing of Harley Quinn or the other many characters of this comic strip but the script by Cristina Hobson which is basically a jewel heist chase tells the audience everything we need to know without previous knowledge plus it's humorous quirky and intelligent . The ""choreography "" to use an old fashioned term or action scenes are amazing and as an ensemble cast I liked everyone in this film. The only 2 significant male cast members Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis the narcissistic ruthless villain and Chris Messina as his sadistic right hand man or BFF as Harley describes him Victor Zsasz are a great partnership. However it's the women in this film that reign supreme give me Harley's Angels any day over Charlie's Angels they're much more fun and entertaining. I particularly liked Jurnee Smollett- Bell as Dinah Lanse the Black Canary and Yep, That's Really Jurnee Smollett-Bell Doing Black Canary's Singing in Birds Of Prey. ... Dinah sings a smooth, slow rendition of the famous James Brown song ""It's a Man's Man's Man's World,"" Rosie Perez is also great as Renee Montoya the defective detective who's only mission is to restore law and order to Gotham but is never taken seriously by her superiors. Ellen Joy Basco as pickpocket Cassandra Cain and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the sole Bertinelli family survivor and now The Huntress are both impressive in Birds of Prey. I'm pleased to read although initially Box office takings on this film was not as impressive as expected Birds of Prey which was estimated to cost USD 84,500,000 had already nearly doubled its cost World wide at USD 145,618,302 hopefully that will mean the team of Harley's Angels may return for another Crazy romp. If you expect the Drama and darkness of the recent wonderful DC Joker with Joaquin Phoenix ( although I'd love to see Joaquin and Margo together in a film ) you won't find it in Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn but if like me you enjoy an entertaining ,movie with fantastic sets and visuals and most importantly great ensemble cast and plot you just might enjoy this film.",9.0,18 February 2020
Disappointing even with low expectations,"Though I was not really looking forward to this movie since I was not familiar with the source material other than the Arrowverse adaptation which was not my favourite part of the series. 1,5 hours of my life that I'll never get back! The plot is predictable, the characters are flat, the jokes feel forced, and most of the action scenes are worse than in a low-budget network TV-series. Not even Ewan McGregor could make it interesting.

Has as many flaws as the Shard,"I have so many problems with this film I don't even know where to begin. Obviously with a movie like this violence is to be expected but this film was just violent for the sake of it. It didn't add to the storyline, and at times was just uncomfortable to watch (and not in a good way). Harley Quinn didn't seem to know whether she was a hero or a villain. A villain should be evil to the core and never consider anyone else's thoughts or feelings, but Harley Quinn was doing bad things sometimes, helping people other times and feeling guilt for doing wrong. And when she was doing bad, did I feel empathy for those she wronged? No. And by the looks of it, everyone in the cinema felt the same way. I looked around and it was just a sea of silent, blank faces. The attempts at comedy were pathetic, the audience laughed once throughout the entire showing, which was right at the end of the film. And the character of Huntress? Completely pointless and added no value to the film whatsoever, if she wasn't in it the story would've gone exactly the same way. Disappointing.",5.0,16 February 2020

This was one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in my life, the script and characters were totally on point. I wasn't even a Harley Quinn fan going into this movie but now I am. Just go see it.

I would honestly say that I enjoyed this movie more than any Marvel movie I've seen in recent years. I honestly don't get the disparity in ratings and reception between Marvel movies and a movie like this, it doesn't make sense to me at all and seems like people are just bandwagoning Marvel and hating on DC for no reason.

People who hate on this movie for being all-girl protagonist are ridiculous, the movie was just entertaining period, who cares if it was an all girl cast? I don't think it affected the actual entertainment value of the movie at all.

Seeing some of the reviews for this movie makes me discount to a degree the value of reviews on IMDB because honestly this movie deserves higher then its score and what some people are saying. For the haters, I honestly think they just have bad taste.

Why is Hollywood trying so hard and unsuccessfully to bring up those movies that suppose to empower women, but in fact look like a bunch of kiddies playing in the sandbox till the adults arrive? It's just ridiculous. Even the villains are a laughing stock, by the comics standards. It's not an awful movie by my standards, it's just not any good.

And those are the kind of men who are the villains in real life. They are not cool, they're not something you can aspire to be. They're pathetic and immature and narcissistic. And that was whole point. Humiliating women is not cool and he wasn't glorified for it. Apart from that, Harley Quinn is an unreliable narrator. That was established pretty early in the film. And it was great to watch. It wasn't a straight narrative and the film was much more better for that. All the outfits were so colorful and amazing. It's feminism wasn't forced.

"What a mess, a fun mess","To be honest ""Birds of Prey and bla bla bla Harley Quinn"" is not actually the proper title of the movie since the later is actually the true main character rather than the former which consists of a group of heroines, instead, it should've been called ""Harley Quinn and the bla bla bla Birds of Prey"". Okay Jokes aside (actually I'm quiet serious about that), I was quiet worried when (before the release) some of general reviewers in Youtube called this movie a mess or quiet a little ""Meh"", I mean, c'mon DC, you were already on the right track since Aquaman (2018) until last year's ""Joker"", now you're gonna make another mess like BvS, 2017's Justice League, and 2016's Suicide Squad? I can't take this anymore, I'm a DC fanboy, I can't take any kind of embarrassment of a movie anymore, can't you guys be creative enough to consistently make a movie that everyone likes or even loves? I mean, you're creative enough to produce tens of comicbooks monthly, with literally the same characters which every fans read but suddenly it becomes sucks when you bring it up to the silver screen??? Have you guys learn nothing??? But thankfully, oh thank god, all those worry and disappointment washed away after I decided to watch it myself. Yes not so much were with me at the studio, which is understandable since it's not ""Endgame"", so I decided to just focus on the movie, and guess what? it's pretty fun to watch! Harley is funny, she stole every scene she was in, the absence of Leto's Joker gave rise to her charisma and interest in the general viewers regarding her personality and kickass action that I feel was lacking in 2016's Suicide Squad (though in the story his presence is felt almost in every filth of Gotham and his very name strikes fear in the hearts of the city's biggest mobs, since the filmmaker position him to be like Ledger's Joker than the one portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix). We also get to see her other side, her lovely kind-hearted side that would make anyone easily sympathize and fall for her, I mean seriously Margot Robbie is quiet stunning (almost with the same effect when I first saw Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman on her first portrayal in BvS) on the camera and her acting skill really bring up the best out of Harley Quinn, which makes me wonder how did I not realize this on her first silver screen appearance in 2016?. Ewan McGregor's performance definitely cannot go overlooked too, I don't quietly aware if his character's counterpart from the source material has the exact same personality, but Ewan reaaly kills it on portraying an evil of a mafia boss with anger management issue which constantly is always in a state of flux thanks to his insecurities. Black Canary's appearance is a little bit different from her image in the comicbook, huntress is a little bit weird to me (almost to the point that I think she is a robot), Renee Montoya's performance is sadly I think is just average, and Cassandra Cain, in my surest opinion, is not what fans would expect or hope for to the point that many of them will fall into disappointment. The choreography for the fight scenes, especially the ones that Harley performs, is very cool and badass, though sometimes I think some of it are a little bit forced by the power of the girls' plot armor. The style of some shots and the gag sequences remind me of any movie directed by Quentin Tarantino (maybe inspired, I don't know), some elements from Harley's previous movie are also brought up here (to make an indirect connection I guess) and most of the time, I enjoy watching it from the title to the credits. Sooooo, yeah, I think it's another win for DC, though not commercially, but at least critics like it more than 2016's Suicide Squad and saw this as an improvement and a good sign that DC is finally find it's own way, it's own style of bringing up its beloved characters without as so much as just blatantly copying Marvel's formula. I think DC should prioritize more on the critical acclaim rather than the commercial one, even though the latter is also very important, because in any company or corporation, the quality of the products must always be put first. From there, comes the trust and faith of the customers (in this case, the fans and the general viewers). From there, commercial success automatically follows.",8.0,7 February 2020

Violent fun and a great time at the movies,"Bird of prey

After watching suicide squad yesterday I am all fought up ready for pirds of prey I know it's more of a spin off than I direct sequel to suicide squad but as it's still the same Harley and the same film universe.

Hats off to Margot Robbie as Harlequin she is fantastic and although called birds of prey is without a doubt her movie and not really a birds of prey movie It may aswell he called Harlequin featuring the birds of prey But by the end that really doesn't matter. Starting with her breakup from the joker one from then on events unfold in a spectacular violent fashion. This is the first dc extended universe movie to be rated 15 and it earns it There's loads of f bombs and plenty of violence. There's a part where Haley breaks a guys leg 3 times with a bat and it's glorious. The fights were imaginative and there are plenty of them. For me it had a Deadpool sort vibe We start out out movie with Harley narrating her story and even jumping back and forth to explain thing or characters. Glorious swearing and violence Not taking itself too seriously and plenty of fourth wall nods and even a joke about lack of weapons before the final showdown. The cast are great After Margot Robbie My favourite being Ewan McGregor as Roman sionis aka black mask and he is twisted He plays basically I violent child who throws a tantrum when somebody takes his things. He hates mess , He is cold and chilling while also being sadistic,funny and another well done batman villain although not completely comic accurate. Ewan mcgereggor really puts himself into his role. Victor Zsasz is his sidekick who isn't too bad as his henchman he is just as sadistic and is romans implied lover. Only thing that could of made this better is Anthony cardigans Zsasz from Gotham. Jurnee Smollett-Bell as the black canary she is stunning with a beautiful voice and baddass to go along with it. Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya plays a cop lifted from 80's action movie and even being referenced so. And Mary elisebth winstead as Helena bartellin aka the huntress played a somewhat smaller role than the others but just fit right. And finally Ella jay basco as casandra Cain the thing that brings them all together The kid who steals the diamond from Sionis and end up being protected by Harley Quinn.

I really enjoyed this movie It's defiantly my sort of film It was pretty much a blast from opening till the end. It had a good story,great character bone crunching action,plenty of swearing and some laugh out loud twisted humour and it's the first dc film in this series to really let lose and make a fun movie.",8.0,7 February 2020

A Zany Fun Ride,"I truly didn't expect to enjoy Birds of Prey as much as I did.

The Good:

Margot Robbie hit it out of the park as Harley Quinn (made me chuckle quite a bit too).
Mary Elizabeth Winstead was decent as Huntress.
Ewan McGregor played a convincing enough Black Mask.
Cinematography was good & fight choreography was satisfying.


The Bad:



That being said when I disapprove of an actor/actress taking on a particular role that does not mean I blame the actor. They have every right to audition for any role. All it means is I don't think that they are meant for particular roles. If anything it's the casting directors that I start to question...

This movie makes me sad.,"Let's start with the good.

Margot Robbie was stellar in this, and did well with what she was given. The amount of work and sheer effort she puts into the character is laudable. Ewan McGregor also delivered an incredible and believable performance, and I look forward to his Obi Wan series.

As for Mary Elizabeth Winstead? Her delivery and moves were tight. She trained for her action scenes, and it showed. To be honest, she steals ever damn scene... but it does seem that that was intentional. Every good quip, every memorable scene - all her. Reloading her crossbow, trying to introduce herself, the slide, the motorbike... meanwhile, I can barely remember any specific scene for any other character. As for them...

Ella Jay Basco. Is she related to a producer? She can't act to save her life. There's a scene where she's pretending to see people massing outside as she looks out of a window. Totally laughable and actually made me laugh.

Rosie Perez. I could barely understand a word she said, as she slurs everything. I had to rely on subtitles. The character is shallow and unimaginative, adding zero to the story whatsoever.

Jurnee Smollett. Bad choreography. I get the impression she didn't train too hard before shooting began.

Now for the movie.

What. The. Frack. Where did the budget go? The choreography and general cinematography was straight out of a CW 'Arrow' episode. Uninspired and unrealistic fight scenes, flubbed action scenes (watch Winstead as she exits the slide), poor action shots (Robbie's stunt double with thicker arms). The script? LOL. What was the point of the lengthy shopping scene? There's a 5-6 minute sequence starting at around 55:35 that served no purpose. After a lengthy car/motorbike chase sequence, two people on foot just materialize out of nowhere right when the plot calls for it.

This was supposed to be set in Gotham, but never did I get that impression. No real effort was made with the set, lighting or cinematography. It felt like downtown in a nameless modern American city... especially during the daylight scenes, of which there were many.

Great movie for wife and family..,"My wife does not understand the DC Universe. Even the animated ""Harley Quinn"" Series , doesn't impress her in any way?

Sisters getting. It. Done.,"Hilarious, stylish, and powerful, the Birds are no man's prey. Margot Robbie and the talented women making this film actually got me out to the theatre and I was not disappointed. The ladies kick some serious tail, and the Harley Fu made the fight scenes entertaining and satisfying when I usually find fighting boring. The disjointed narrative is perfectly congruent with the state of Harley's mind. They problem-solve and succeed by supporting each other as total badasses.

Harley fascinates; the actual Birds of Prey not so much! [+54%],"It's true that the best thing about 2016's turdy Suicide Squad was Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. But whether the character was strong enough to warrant a movie of her own was another debate altogether. And here we are, with Birds of Prey, featuring all-women leads, written and directed by two women. Their effort is commendable and Harley is the closest you can get to a Deadpool in the DCEU but it still lacks the tongue-in-cheek oomph that a movie such as this, desperately needs.

The screenplay by Chistina Hodson is very patchy. Every time a set-piece is about to commence or a new (or random) character appears on the screen, the viewers are quickly spoonfed a backstory as to how to why it's happening - it's a trope that the likes of Tarantino and Guy Ritchie have successfully attempted and pulled off. That too, featuring umpteen instances of black humour. Birds of Prey mistakes glitter guns, fancy hairstyles and girly catchphrases for coolth.

We do get some extra insight into the animated psyche of Harley Quinn - how she deals with life post her breakup with the Joker (who is nowhere to be seen; neither is Batman - this is Gotham City after all!). There's a delicious (literally!) stretch about Harley craving an eggs & bacon sandwich that was fairly amusing, and I wish they had retained the same zing for the rest of the movie. While The Huntress' (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) story was the most bearable (and fleshed out) of the lot, the characterizations of Dinah Lance, Renee Montoya, Cassandra Cain, and especially, Roman Sionis a.k.a Black Mask felt off.

Mcgregor, who plays Black Mask, seems to have had some R-rated fun but his character doesn't intimidate. Same goes for Victor Zsasz (a knife-wielding serial killer and one of the rogues on Batman's take-down list), played by a bleached-looking Chris Messina. To make matters worse, the film always plays to Quinn's vicious glee and untimely comedic lines (""This is just like a sleepover! We should order pizza"") and never puts her character in jeopardy.. even when she's held captive by Roman. All her break-up trauma is explained in bar scenes where she's getting drunk, beating men up, or being saved by the Black Canary. Basically, it's all just an excuse to go all-out weirder and noisier (and to ignore Jared Leto!).

The set-pieces are well shot; the one in the climax particularly stood out. It even temporarily makes you believe that a familiar Gotham character cameo is about to appear (but nope). No mid/post-credits either. None of Harley's female sidekicks (except for The Huntress) leave lasting impressions. Unless the stakes are upped big time and the comedy is written in a much more engaging manner, I'm not sure if I'd be excited for a sequel.",5.0,25 March 2020

Whatsername that played the heroine was ok, but no one could have saved this vacuous muck from the bin and I strongly advise her to keep away from comic book films if she wants a career ... Another one of these and I'll think twice if I see her name attached to anything ... In fact her and Samara Weaving are interchangeable really, but Weaving has more suss and has chosen her work more sensibly and will last as an actress ...

Lifeless,"I went into this with low expectations. I wanted to just have fun, I wanted a fun movie with some good action. So I was disappointed when the movie ended and I just felt like I saw a shameless cash grab. It's sad when a movie centred around Harley Quinn has a more interesting character. Huntress was my favourite character but she doesn't even get any real lines until the last 30 minutes of the movie. This film introduces so many characters and expects you to care about them but I just didn't. I see people talking about the police station scene. Yep, that's the best scene but even that didn't feel like a Kingsman church scene to me. It's all just choreographed poorly and I didn't get invested in it. There were actually shots in this film that I was about to say ""wow, this is going to be a cool long take"" and then it just cut. I really wanted to like this but it just feels like an empty dead cash grab. I think this movie needed a better plot and more set up for it's characters. The main villain just feels weak.

"This is a really unusual movie, full of laughs and brutal violence. Excellent.","Just watched Birds of Prey again. The elegant violence of the fight scenes, and the sheer Tom and Jerry comedy of them is fabulous to behold. This is a really good, joyous, dark unconventional superhero movie, with an oddball anti-heroine and some really excellent direction. The script is also hilarious. So, I would say, worth a look.

I had to go twice, because the first time I didn't realise it was going to be quite so much of a comedy, and it took me ten minutes to tune in. I was expecting something more like Suicide Squad than Shazam!, and this is very much a fun movie in the Deadpool vein. Dark and hilarious, it also has something of the 1960s Batman in it, especially with one fight scene.

Joyously oddball. Margot Robbie is outstanding, but so are the other women in it. The guys are baddies, mainly, or feckless and the women have to work together to win. There is a message there, and I'd say it's probably worth knowing. If I had a daughter, I would be pleased for her to be given this piece of advice in film, rather than she learn to be bit of eye candy draped on the set to furnish it.

"Margot Robbie is brilliant, the film is visually spectacular and very enjoyable","I wonder sometimes if I have watched the same film or seen it with the same eyes as some of these super low scores. I then read many to understand their points and consider my own thoughts about the film.

Here is my opinion, and I DO WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN, SO I WILL, I am not particularly a Marvel or DC only fan, I love films for being enjoyable, watchable, well acted, good story, beautiful or meaningful. This film certainly met many of these in my opinion.

Margot Robbie was brilliant, endearing, awesome stunts and very intense but in a whole different level to the recent a Joker performance, but still very well played. The story was weird but I followed it and it made sense despite jumping backwards and forwards, it's a style, accept it and move on. All the Harlequin toys and props are there in the film, awesome and funny seeing them actually being used like the baseball bat, hammer and all the rest. As for the Birds of Prey, yes, these were disappointing and this was the only let down in my opinion, but it's a starter movie, it's how she became independent of Joker, I'd expect a sequel to use them more and introduce them in a deeper way.

Birds of Prey,"Birds of Prey seems to be more of a Harley Quinn solo movie. It is way more about Harley Quinn than the Birds of Prey, so this movie seems like it should simply be called Harley Quinn. This movie delves more into the mind of Harley Quinn, as it's told from Harley's perspective. The movie is like DC trying to pull a Deadpool. The main difference is Margot Robbie didn't have roles like Hannibal King in Blade Trinity and Green Lantern. The concept of this movie is similar to that of Deadpool. It's about a mercenary with a superhero team in the movie that the mercenary is not really in. I feel like Deadpool did it better overall. By the time Deadpool released, the X-Men were well pretty established. In this movie, the Birds of Prey were supposed to be introduced to the audience yet they're sidelined. Not comparing to Deadpool this time, one thing about this movie I have a complaint about is that it's more into action than formulating a cohesive story.

Mediocre acting and mediocre action,"I am not a big Suicide Squad fan, but this feels like a budget version of Suicide Squad: the same kind of interchangeable plot dressed with a little edgy-teen humour to make it look 'adult'.

Despite some good ideas (i.e. Roller-skates car chase) the action scenes are not particularly convincing, in part because the choreography is uninventive, but mostly because the acting is subpar. This problem reaches beyond the stunts however: the kid is great, but the rest of the 'Birds of Prey' are too generic for anyone to care. Largely, this is because Robbie/Quinn monopolises so much of the screen time. The villains are forgettable (which is OK for the type of 'street-level' super antics the film goes for) but all in all there are few memorable scenes, characters or dialogue lines in the whole flick.

This is unfortunate because Quinn herself has potential (in fact the animated Harley Quinn series is pretty much what this film tried and failed to be.

Be aware the movie's Cassandra Cain, Renee Montoya and although Helena Bertinelli and, of course Harley Quinn do follow heavily from their DC Comics origins - Harley even has one of her trademark hyenas and Beaver!

The movie doesn't really take itself seriously but that isn't to say that it is slapstick but it is a whole lot of fun - as you would probably expect from anything 'starring' Harley Quinn.

When people say that they couldn't follow the storyline or didn't understand what was happening then I really don't know what movie they were watching??? The storyline is easy to follow and, yes there are some flashbacks, and yes you do need to actually WATCH the movie, but isn't that why you paid to go to the movies in the first place???

But who asked for this?,"As the DC Extended Universe muddled on at the turn of the decade, there were plenty of signs that things were not going in the right direction. The introduction of 'Birds of Prey' as the first DC entry of the 2020s is symbolic of the trajectory that would follow.

Subtitled 'The Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn,' the Margot Robbie-starring violencefest is intentionally offbeat to match the individual whose story is portrayed, but it falters in similar ways to 2016's 'Suicide Squad.' Aside from Robbie's transformation into the crazed former psychiatrist turned vigilante, it's just not enjoyable to watch the onscreen antics of this rag-tag crew, from the bumbling villains (a screechy Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis and Chris Messina as his ""lost puppy"" Victor Zsasz) to the clichéd bad girls club (Ella Jay Basco, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rosie Perez and Jurnee Smollett).

It's not a hot take to say 'Prey' as a film is a dumpster fire. It's loud, snippy, gross, and despite its uniqueness as a superhero (or antihero) film, it feels forced. It's possible I'm not its target audience, but it's hard to say who is.",3.0,7 April 2024

Some viewers may be put off by female angst against masculine oppression, these themes in art disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed, as is reflected in many of the reviews here.

Just watch Harley Quinn the animated series,"This is my second time watching it, or trying to. I either fell asleep or turned my tv off because there is no way I watched 3/4 of this the first time. I don't remember anything past the intro.

Just the opening monologue annoys the vinegar out of me.

I much prefer Kaley Cuoco's portrayal and the world they've built there.

This is just a stupid idea probably pitched by a suit who has no understanding of either of the source materials. Which isn't a bad thing, except they should have made a birds or prey movie AND a Harley Quinn solo feature. Not combined the too because frankly women deserve it.

And this feels almost on purpose like some angry dude trying to cap two bad ass female driven pieces of DC IP.

Idk maybe I'm not the audience but this just feel like tokenism versus actual representation. Like where oracle? The disabled vote?

Oh and the face tattoos? Seriously? Ok Jared Leto.

Aftern finishing, I've upped my rating from 1 to 4.

It's a bad movie and I do think DC needs to have faith in their intellectual property and stop shoving all these names into one movie. But I enjoyed it.

And they need to stop sucking batman's codpiece, why is oracle not in this? You've replaced an integral DISABLED superhero for another minority character with no legacy other than a name commissioner Gordon says once in a while. No connection to the birds of prey.

I'm totally cool with race bending black Canary. Like that plus the kid were enough. You could have given representation to the disabled community, but no her other name is batwoman. Ergo stop sucking batman's codpiece, especially if you're not gonna feature him where he's appropriate. (The boss fight)

Same reason they turned the green arrow edgy and dark. DC has some weird thing about actually using the characters they own.",4.0,23 June 2021

Potential -,"Firstly I gotta say a well done to the actor's and actresses, but you tried your hardest but was let down by the people in charge.

Where should I begin?

Editing was done poorly with a question of... Did you really watch your movie before releasing it? Did you take criticism on board?

Director, the flow felt off, a good example is the big fight scene towards the end! A simple fix, slightly speed up the frame rate and the fighting would have made the fight seem real rather than a rehearsal take on slow Mo.

The style of filming, well just watch the movie, disjointed with different styles but adding nothing to benefit, the lighting, the speed and so much more was just off.

If you think I'm being cruel and insensitive then think about the actor's and actresses you let down.

If you want it fixed then I'm willing to help as it wouldn't take much with the right people at my side but try and save it.

To the producers, you had an opportunity to make a movie with real impact... But did any of you really watch the movie before you launched it or even had any passion?

I still scored the movie a 5, but that just for the potential, just imagine if you took a little more time and care on this one.

A Fun Thrilling Ride With Harley Quinn as Your Tour Guide!!!,"I absolutely love Margot Robbie's portrayal as Harley Quinn. She's funny, cute, adorable, quirky, psycho and kicks ass! She definitely makes the movie better. The movie itself is similar to the style of 'Deadpool' because Harley breaks the 4th wall and talks to the audience directly and purposely tells the story out of order, from her perspective. This is the kind of comic book movie I like; fun, quirky characters and lots of action. I don't really care much for dark dreary DC movies that are overly long and drag on (I'm looking at you, Christopher Nolan) This movie is the 8th installment of the DC Extended Universe. This review might contain some spoilers!

The movie takes place a little bit after Suicide Squad. Harley Quinn is a sad depressed mess because The Joker breaks up with her, for good. (Jared Leto does not return, but we just hear about him throughout) Harley goes through all the stages of a break-up like cutting her hair, eating junk food, buying a hyena as a pet and watching sappy love movies and soap operas.

Now that Harley and Joker are over, criminals and mafia kingpins have declared war on her. The main villain is Roman Sionis, a psycho brutal crime lord who owns a bar and is looking for his missing diamond that was taken by a teen-aged girl named Cassandra. Harley makes a deal with Roman and tries to get him the diamond in hopes that every thug in Gotham will leave her alone.

Over the course of the movie, we meet The Huntress, Black Canary, and Detective Montoya who all have a score to settle with Roman. Harley must team up with the 'Birds of Prey' and take down Roman and his goons if they want to save the girl and make it out alive. If you love action, comic book movies, and Harley Quinn, I highly recommend BIRDS OF PREY AND THE FANTABULOUS EMANCIPATION OF ONE HARLEY QUINN!!!",10.0,15 May 2020

Birds of Prey,"The film should have been about this interesting gang of misfits but unfortunately they gang up way too late into the movie. The process of getting there is full of bad jokes, corny backstories and really not that interesting. The actions scenes are mediocre at best when comparing to straight action films. Visually, it is quite pleasing at times (the police station scene) and does have that Harley Quinn sort of quirkiness, but Margot Robbie's iteration of the icon feels barely acceptable, still not psycho enough. Financially, totally see why the film is a box-office bust as there really isn't much to market there, and the films feels geared towards a more female tween oriented market. Also a little abrupt what they did to the villains, feels unnecessary to finish them off in the ways they did.",3.0,14 July 2020
Quintessential Quinn,"Maybe you had to be there? There is no way anyone growing up with the comics wouldn't appreciate this addition to the universe. I am updating my review because I recently caught this on television and it translates into timeless entertainment. If your reading this in 2030 you might be suprised to learn that as I write this updated review 8/20 the rating is a 6 . If you are wondering how this could have happened , I believe it's because of the expectations that movie Joker placed on the direction of the story telling. It may have been a a tough act to follow for anyone. Sure, I wasn't expecting much but the opening credits nodded to what was to come and I appreciate so many aspects of how this was done. And there is Roller-skate fighting! This qualifies everything I have stated lol I wasn't sure I was in for a zany Harley Quinn ride. I didn't even know what I wanted, Soon I was won over and for the price of a movie ticket I was thoroughly entertained ! Update I recently caught this on television, it translates beautifully! Maybe it was meant for the longevity of the small big screen. No spoilers, I get that, I personally avoid previews to movies I plan to see. Ps when will IMDB have some basic standards?

Cause Birds of Prey hasn't been touched by PC wokeness. It is just a hugely entertaining, extremely R-rated romp with fun characters, dazzling visuals and bone-crunching fight choreography! Not to mention it's filled with wicked performances, charm and lots of laughs.

BIRDS OF PREY (2020) - 14/02/2020,"I'm slowly coming to the realisation that this isn't as amazing as I wanted it to be on third rewatch. It was fine, not as funny or unique as I was hoping for and the rewatch value sure has went down, but had fun fight scenes and a decent cast. Some of the fight choreography was fun to watch, but the pacing of the movie was questionable and most of the characters didn't have anything interesting going on. Despite it's disjointed storytelling, unneeded characters and an overuse of narration, Birds of Prey succeeds on what it promises thanks to some fun action sequences and Margot Robbie's crazily fantabulous performance.

Mitchell Bulfin",5.0,10 March 2020
I really didn't think they would make a movie worse than Suicide Squad.,"I can't say I had high hopes for Birds of Prey. The only reason I watched it was because I love Harley Quinn. But going by the trailers I had a bad feeling about it. And when they changed its name to more feature her, I worried even more.

I finally watched it and I was very disappointed. While Robbie was excellent as Harley yet again, they wasted her potential. I'll skip the fact that the ""team"" doesn't get together until the last 20 minutes. But it felt like they really had no good ideas for a story and just ended up throwing in a bunch of super stuff to try and sell it. Now normally I don't mind female power, I think it's great. Wonder Woman, Captain America...etc did it well. But it fell flat in this. It felt like 99% of the movie focused on every man in it and every woman was good. Literally even good men are shown as bad. And while I can agree the ""good"" men turned on the women, it felt over the top with its message. It lost focus on a good story.

If you thought Suicide Squad was all over the place then you will find this to be a nightmare. The amount of songs in it was also a bit much. I do understand this type of goofiness is what you think of when you think of Harley, but it was very cringy in this. They would have been better leaving the Birds of Prey loose storyline out of it really. To be fair I can't think of what a good Harley story would be since people always associate her with Joker. Which is why despite how Joker treats her, she really works with him in a movie.

The only reason I even get it a 3 star was because, again, of Robbie's performance is wonderful. You can tell she put a lot into being Harley again. While I doubt we will get any more movies with her, we are stuck with this. This flop. I feel like DC only makes amazing movies or terrible movies. Nothing inbetween.",3.0,10 April 2020

A review from someone who watched the movie twice,"I don't get the hate for this movie. It's a really fun kickass Harley Quinn movie which introduces some awesome characters such as Black Canary and Huntress. I love how it is Harley telling the story. It makes it more unpredictable and keeps the humor ratcheted up the entire time. I do wish Black Mask and Huntress got more screen time because they were both outstanding in this film. In regards to the ""wokeness"" of this movie, I personally didn't see what everyone is complaining about. If you want to have fun, laugh, and watch Margot Robbie at her best, go see this movie.

Yes HQ did dominate, but did anyone think that this was a decision made because an HQ exclusive movie wouldn't satisfy? Birds of Prey needed a backstory so we got a 2 for 1 deal. DC is not constrained by ratings and are trying to appeal to an adult audience (like Joker before), but will probably suffer in the end. I have to say this one satisfied.

The vividness of Harley Quinn's image and clothing overrides everything else.

Birds of Prey is a hymn to the now fashionable feminism. Nothing against independent and strong women, but not so grotesque and straightforward. If a man is strong, he is strong in himself, not at the expense of the weakness of others. In the film, however, one gets the sense that the not-so-intelligent young ladies are defeating a bunch of half-wits.

Rebel In The FDG,"The film already begins with Harley being thrown out by the ex-boyfriend, to the sound of the best and loud Rock N ROLL !!

And then the Roller Derby scene, it's awesome, energy and pure attitude, everything to do with the Harley Quinn character.

I was surprised by this film, I found things that I have never seen in any film. Birds of Prey are rebellious, fun, wild, I loved it !!

The action scenes don't have CGI and are long, rough, loud, fast and uncut, it's awesome!

I freaked out at the police station, from start to finish, it's a funny and electrifying moment, Harley Quinn has an exciting presence and power.

And Margot Robbie then ?! I couldn't see the actress, she is just Harley Quinn !! You can only know that it is Margot, because MY GOD, she is very sexy, cute. The expressiveness of Harley Quinn is something apart, in the moments when she is sad, just because of Margot Robbie's expressions and her striking eyes, you feel the depth of sadness and disappointment, and these scenes last only minutes, it's incredible , just a very dedicated, passionate and talented actress to do that.

And the scene where she smiles with bloody teeth, a demented smile? She is crazy and don't give a damn !!

Finally, the roller skating chase was the apex of the film, again congratulations to Margot Robbie for all the passion and the willingness she showed in these scenes, it was so epic and rad !!

Enough entertainment,"I love Margot as Harley, I can't imagine anyone else but her playing the character, she is awesome.

The movie is funny at times, and it has great fight scenes (I really think that's the strength of it). It has some plot holes (namely, how did Harley knew who had the diamond...?), but it's fine, I won't get into it that much.

I love Ewan as Black Mask, I think he is over the top just enough that's truly entertaining to see him on screen every time.

I don't like the storytelling approach they kind of went for it when trying to tell the story tho, for most of it, the storyline is all over the place, and can get a bit annoying at times. Maybe that's what they were going for? Sure, still, I don't think it was the right choice.

I agree somewhat with some of the criticism that I saw some people having towards the movie. Yes, I think that sometimes, the its formula can get pretty dated, and you pretty much can see where they are going. Every single man on screen is a jerk, or a rapist, and etc. But again, I get what message the movie was trying to pass, even though it's far from being subtle, I think that it manages to give Harley the so called emancipation, and well, I'm ok with that.

If they ever make a sequel, I truly think that the formula cannot survive one more time tho, they will have to re-think some stuff.

Overall, Birds of Prey: Harley Quinn, or whatever it's been called nowadays, is a good movie, is definitely better than Suicide Squad, it has great action scenes, and great acting, is funny enough and will get you entertained for most of its runtime.

--------- 2022 update

After rewatching the movie again two years after writing this review, surprisingly I liked way more than the first time. What at first glance seemed to me like a confused movie, now I realize it was actually the whole point, and I thought it was pretty clever to have the storytelling structure in a way mirror Harley's crazy mind. As I said before, the fight scenes are awesome, and watching Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor on screen going crazy with their characters is just awesome. The movie is fun, and goes by really quickly. I still thing the overall emancipation message isn't subtle and could be a bit better, however, it might be just that I'm a dude and this specific part isn't necessarily for me, which I get and respect. My previous grade was 6,5, now I can give it easily an 8.",8.0,26 February 2020
a real effort to not turn it off,Jumbled Nonsense. First film with Margot Robbie I've disliked. Shes the perfect harlequin..very frustrating.,4.0,25 June 2021
The things wrong with it shouldn't be the things wrong with it,"First and foremost. Why the hell is the choreography so bad? This is supposed to be a big blockbluster. I havent seen a movie entirely rely on slow motion since the mid 2000s. Theres just no excuse. And as much as I like Margo Robbie, I dont think the script writers did her lines any favors. It wasn't her portayal for me, it was the things she said. Theres no reason i should find a lead character in any movie to be annoying or dumb unless they are intended to be. I actually found a movie where I didn't like Ewan Mcgregor. And the final complaint aside from it just being dull and lackluster, is the complete lack of comedy when it tries so hard to be funny. I could care less if it has an agenda. There's plenty of amazing agenda heavy movies out there. That isnt the problem here. This movie is bad just because it is bad.",4.0,9 October 2020
Surprisingly Great!,"I absolutely haaated Suicide Squad so I was prepared to hate this one as well, but was pleasantly surprised! Yeah some of the writing is cheesy, but that's DC for you.

The Appalling Title Is Better Than the Movie,"Oh boy, this movie is such a step down from the already mediocre Suicide Squad flick.

High expectations and then high disappointments,"Maybe, the name of the movie should be called: Harley quinn. The story begins with Harley quinn's narrative and it used backwards many times. To be honest, its watching experience is not very good. Especially for the audience without any background, it is difficult to quickly accept and understand the plot. Finally, there was a DC film about the Women 's League, where the characters were pale, simple and without connotation. As for the cooperation of the female protagonists behind, it is simply casual and childish. In addition to these, the movie music is pretty good, and if you don't ask for a deep and meaningful story, the plot is quite crazy, refreshing and personal. But, when can I see a good movie that truly shows the qualities of women and women?",5.0,15 May 2020
Highly entertaining and inventive.,"Birds of Prey is surprisingly good film with splashes of originality missing from most DC films of late (Joker withstanding).

Theres many moments that are fun, the action is both bizarre and over the top-just like joker girlfriend you expect her to be-and she got her mission to save gotica girls from the bad guys(in a movie where theres no batman) basically, i highly doubt you can not enjoy her acting, she is pretty, but this movie proves that she is fun, really fun, theres alot of comedy scenes that works because she know how to deliver the jokes.",10.0,4 May 2024

Absolute Perfection!,"So I have to straight up say that for all of you who are cautious of seeing this film because of the negative articles about it's box office failure, that doesn't negate the absolutely outstanding talent behind this movie.

To finally end this review I just have to give massive credit to Margot Robbie and gang, especially to her because she isn't Margot Robbie in the movie.

I don't get the hate- I found it fun and entertaining,"The movie was colourful, fun and entertaining, it certainly lacked a bit of depth but what superhero movie doesn't. I feel like a lot of the people who left reviews might have not whatched the movie or simply stoped early as there are a lot of outright mistakes abou the story. I really don't see the politicised argument since there are two blink and you miss it vague refrences to feminism. Harley is fun and the story concise, I particularly love Huntress and how she is simoultaniously a cold blooded killer but is unabel to comunicate her chosen name accuratly to the world which results in her being called with complelty different one. It also portrays a more human Harley and starts showing hints of being a deeper character. FInally I loved the relationship between Harley and Cassandra Cain reminding me of two sisters. This movie doesn't take itself too seriously, has comedy that works and is over all a fun ride.",10.0,4 February 2021
Was vulgarity really necessary?,"I enjoyed the color, confusion, and chaotic pace. It was interesting -not unlike a DC comic- lacking long story arcs and character development.

However, the continual use of vulgar language became boring. It was like watching prepubescent children daring to talk dirty when parents weren't around to scold them.

Frankly, it's poor writing.

This audience didn't appreciate it. And it certainly didn't WOW audiences in North Am. And I bet if it was well written without using vulgarity, it would have made far more money.

Of course, the jump cuts, shaky cam, and overall unintelligible dialog didn't help. Had to turn on subtitles to catch much of it. Sure I could be going deaf, but I have no trouble with dialog in ""old timer"" movies, action or otherwise.

Sadly, ""modern"" mass media has embraced crapola in the vain attempt to squeeze out every bit of moolah. Does anyone try to make a product that would be remembered as quality from 500 years hence? Definitely not going to be the ""Shakespeare"" of this generation.",3.0,4 May 2024
Harley Quinn longest movie name ever!,"The DCEU is (in)famous for its darker take on the comic book genre, and this movie is like that... In no way whatsoever.

This movie is like a bubblegum pop music video on an acid trip. It's bright and colourful and very girly but it's funky, fun and refreshing. It doesn't take itself too seriously, it's pretty funny and the characters and action are over the top.

I think this movie unfairly gets a lot of stick because it's a female lead movie, but it's much better than other movies that try to have an all female cast.

Ewan McGregor does a fine job playing a villain for a change. Might be your standard over the top villain, but I feel he blends moments of campiness and moments of intimidating bad guy to keep him more interesting than many more forgettable movie villains.

Some random thoughts from someone who enjoyed this movie as a guilty pleasure,"Gotham City has been portrayed in films and television many times since the first Batman serial was released back in 1943, so you'd think that town would have worn out its welcome by now. But Birds of Prey takes great pains to remind us that today's cities are more than just bloated villages; they're multicultural microcosms. Most depictions of Gotham make it look like Manhattan (specifically, as comic book editor Dennis O'Neil put it, Lower Manhattan around midnight on the coldest night of November), but here Bruce Wayne's hometown smacks a lot more of Brooklyn, and 21st-century Brooklyn in particular (especially ironic since this movie was filmed entirely in Southern California). Harley lives in a hipster's paradise where you never know just what you might see (or what you might eat, since Harley is very fond of food, and particularly ethnic food). Everything looks like a carnival, and that's before we get to the Joker's former amusement park hideout. Not only does the location make a very fitting dwelling for the story's unapologetically bohemian characters, but in an odd way it brings a dash of realism to what is otherwise a fantastic tale. Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher constructed Gothams composed of what were basically glorified cardboard cutouts, while Christopher Nolan depicted a sterile and anonymous world where technology seemed to have utterly triumphed.

But of course, the location is only half the setting; the staging is equally important. And what a stage we have here! All comic book movies contain at least a hint of the absurd, but Birds of Prey makes all of them look downright tame by comparison. I would say that watching it is like looking at the world through the eyes of the Joker, but then I remember that the Joker is even crazier than what's depicted here! But after all, Harley Quinn has been the Joker's disciple, and he certainly instilled her with a sense of wildly imaginative wonder in addition to all his other wacked-out sensibilities. Harley is a most audacious graffiti artist, and what a joy it is to watch her literally use the movie screen as her canvas! (Remember all those Day-Glo doodles in Suicide Squad? Here the entire movie is like that.) I think that's actually the key to Harley's appeal: there is plenty of innocence mixed in with her cynicism and coarseness, not to mention an inborn penchant for everything bizarre and outrageous. Compute all those factors and you get precisely what Birds of Prey is: an ultraviolent and very contemporary urban crime drama that often looks more like a classic Tex Avery cartoon. We all come to see the dark side of life at some point, but that doesn't necessarily mean we grow up.

Oh, yes - the violence. It is with only slight exaggeration that I dub Birds of Prey possibly the most violent movie I have ever seen (including all the horror films). Quentin Tarantino and Zack Snyder may have raised ""violence porn"" to the level of high art, but when it comes to sheer spectacle neither of them can match what director Cathy Yan has crafted here. Harley is such a terror with her ""confetti gun"" that you're almost left wondering whether Al-Qaeda just created a ""circus"" division, and she strikes grown men with her ""Itchy & Scratchy""-style mallet viciously enough to crack jaws and break bones. (Home Alone burglars Harry and Marv were very lucky that they picked the McAllister residence and not the Quinn residence.) As if that weren't memorable enough, we also see the assassin Helena Bertinelli (also known as ""The Huntress"") using her crossbow to shoot people in the throat! And of course, how could I neglect to mention the scene of a runaway truck smashing into a chemical plant and causing it to explode in a cataclysm of neon-colored vapor? In the shadow of all that, the villain's nasty habit of slicing off the faces of his torture victims is almost forgettable.

Many people have said - almost to the point that it's become a cliché by now - that Birds of Prey is ""feminazi,"" or ""anti-man,"" or something similar. Considering how far afield our American culture has drifted, I find an issue like that almost trivial. Anyway, Birds of Prey, with its more heteronormative take on gender roles than we often see in the junk culture (one character is a lesbian, but that almost never comes up), is much less offensive to me than many of the ""girl-power"" farces I grew up watching. I need only mention Buffy the Vampire Slayer, where a girl grows up to become the deadliest fighter in the world despite having spent her youth in privileged sloth. But that wouldn't include the countless cookie-cutter heroines who thrived irrespective of Buffy - ladies who were able to effortlessly kick you-know-what because, well, they were women, and to dispute that point was to reveal yourself to be sexist. Birds of Prey, on the other hand, is more grounded in reality in the sense that it acknowledges that gender difference does matter: not only do all the heroines dress in basically masculine attire when they're out doing hyper-macho things, but the cutesy-wutesy Harley is more a cheerleader than a star athlete; and in comparison to the other Birds, her martial arts skills are lackluster and would not serve her well if she did not have one of her trademark Joker-style gag weapons in her hands (aside from the fact that she also somehow knows some professional wrestling moves, because ha-ha, comedy).

And that point brings me to the one ideological sweet spot that Birds of Prey hits right on the bull's-eye: despite its diverse cast and its message of female empowerment, the movie goes beyond psychosocial realism and straight to unvarnished emotional authenticity, thus becoming unabashedly politically incorrect. The humor is wacky, but it articulates a sort of antic disgust with the ""conventional"" world and especially with sociocultural pieties of all varieties. Harley Quinn may be a sociopath, but at least she's fair and rational, hating everyone pretty much equally and making the point that every single human being is a piece of scum at some point. In the course of reflecting on this movie, I'm reminded - fittingly enough - of last fall's Joker, wherein the Joaquin Phoenix incarnation of the character spewed misanthropic rhetoric with an absurdly ironic grin (definitely an improvement over Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, and Jared Leto, all of whom colorlessly drawled anarchic wisdom with the glibness of a Zen master). But whereas Phoenix's take on the Clown Prince of Crime was deadly serious behind the obscenity, Margot Robbie's Clown Princess manages to channel her rage into jolly camp. That's probably the one thing about Birds of Prey that most appeals to me: for all its flaws, it manages to tell a tale about Gotham every bit as bleak as Burton's in a way that leaves you feeling almost as if you've just watched a marathon of Adam West's Batman. By the time the Picasso-inspired end credits sequence rolls, you're joyously drained.",5.0,16 February 2020

Just Go See It,"I personally loved the movie. I don't think it was perfect, but it was unlike any other ""super-hero"" action movie I have seen before. It's hard to read all of the 1/10 star comments complaining about a ""man-hating"" and ""too-feminist"" movie. I even read a comment calling it a ""chick flick"". Did we watch different movies? Do you call this feminist propaganda because it had female leads? Are you too easily offended to enjoy any movie outside of a male lead? (Sorry you had to look at a beautiful woman for 106 minutes.)

The movie was messy, yes. Harley Quinn is messy. It is not often you come across an unspoken, respectable ""girl gang"" in action movies (not like the God awful and trite scene in Infinity War).

So, my conclusion: it was a good movie. Funny, entertaining, and great fight scenes and effects. It genuinely surprised me, too - choosing to watch this movie was by chance and I had seen every other movie at the theater at the time. It is not perfect, but it addresses a different crowd in a non-condescending and purely enjoyable way. If you can't enjoy this movie because you think they ""made Margot Robbie ugly"" or because its main group of protagonists are women and ""too diverse""... You might want to do some reflection on how sensitive you are.

Suffers from too many undeveloped characters,"The movie feels like DC/WB rushed it into production after everyone agreed Robbie was the best thing in Suicide Squad. Unfortunately WB didn't let Robbie carry this movie on her own and instead weighed the story down with too many other characters they tried to develop. In a better universe this movie would have come out after we had movie that introduced Huntress' backstory. It's only towards the end that we get to really have chance to see Winstead's take on the character. Her humorous social awkwardness was never really given enough room to shine in a loaded ensemble piece. Likewise Perez's Montoya and Smollet's Canary are not fleshed out well in the runtime allotted. The movie also feels like a step backwards as far as Harley's skills are concerned. In Suicide Squad she was lethal when not distracted by something shiny. Here her skills seem to play second fiddle to blind luck at times. DC has much more interesting characters than Marvel in their stable. It's really frustrating that they can't figure out how to do anything decent with them most of the time. The Harley-Joker breakup in the comics with Poison Ivy would have been a much better film, with less clutter and more of a chance for Robbie to chew up the scenery.",5.0,18 May 2020
A high flier,"Birds of Prey gets a lot of hate that it honestly doesn't deserve and it is a great movie, it follows Harley Quinn once again played by Margot Robbie, easily the best part of Suicide Squad and after watching it for the first time I don't understand why so many people hate it.

Margot Robbie is once again fantastic as Harley Quinn and it's a top 15 CBM casting of all time, the movie looks wonderful and it's fantastically directed by Cathy Yan, with a great color palette and while the humor is minimal, when it's there it really hits, I will say the movie definitely faulted in characterization, Ewan McGregor is greatly over-the-top in this film and this film is really fun to watch, with a hilarious ending and one of my favorite comic book movie team-ups.

Engaging and Powerful,"I don't often write reviews for movies but after seeing ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" I knew I needed to write one. This movie is funny, action-packed, fun, and has a great soundtrack so I don't know where a lot of the negative reviews are coming from. Margot Robbie plays Harley Quinn to a tee and absolutely kills her performance. The supporting cast--Rosie Perez, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, and Ella Jay Basco-- does a great job at bringing to life their powerful characters. I heard a lot of hesitance about this movie stems from the fact that people are worried that it would teeter on the line of ""man-hating"" but I am here to dispel those rumors and let you all know that it is nothing like that! The movie does not focus on trivial ideals such as ""hating men"" and instead choses to focus on Harley Quinn and how she struggles to move on post Joker.

Fun yet Messy Rollercoaster of a Movie,"I'll make this simple. This was overall a fun, quirky, colourful and unique girl-gang movie with a basic plot, enjoyable action, amazing soundtrack and cinematography, and more than enough comedy. A solid introduction to the Birds of Prey. Here are some pros and cons to give you a quick insight:

Pros:
Margot Robbie's and Ewan Mcgregor's performance. They truly gave more life to their characters.
Everyone gave an overall acceptable performance, acting wise.
Huntress', Black Canary's and Renee Montoya's comic accurate 'origin' (wasn't really origin for Black Canary and Renee) story.


Cons:


Overall a fun film. The cons I wrote were things to consider if you're a bit pickier (like me at times).",8.0,15 February 2020
Terrible patriarchal movie,"The movie is revolves around an exaggerated patriarchy where men are manipulative & condescending to women. It's so obvious & exaggerated that it's annoying to me, and I'm not even a feminist. In addition most of the cast are just terrible actors/actresses. Very disappointing especially the lady detective and little kid. The dialogue & humor in the movie is also just plain. Not much thought put into it. I wouldn't recommend watching",3.0,27 December 2020
Absolute blast from start to finish despite small comic inaccuracies,"Let me start this off with saying I love this movie. I am A black male, and its great. Let's get this out of the way. This is a girl power film even more than wonder woman, the villains are men the heroes are women, but thats not a bad thing. There are lead characters who are men, and they are great. The show-stealer, considering this is more of a Harley Quinn film is Margot Robbie as the woman of the hours. She lights up every scene she's in, and pulls off impressive stunts. An unlikely favorite is Mary Elizabeth Winstead as The Crossbow Killer (if you've seen it you get it). Every line that comes out of her mouth is hilarious and I laughed out loud far too many times. The other 'heroes' are all great as well especially Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya. My only gripes about this film are the comic inaccuracies and the pingpong pace of the first 30 minutes. It launches between a harley/canary scene then to a roman/renee scene a lot in the first act of the film. Cassandra cane seems to be a totally different person from the comics, but Ella Jay Basco is polarizing in the role. The main male presence, Ewan Mcgregor as Black Mask (though he only wears it in like one scene) has the high ground in dceu villains. (Get it?) he really has a blast with the 'I'm just such an irredeemable terrible person' character. The action is amazing, being in part shot by John Wick director Chad Stahelski. Every scene pops with color and every hit pushes its R-rated gore. Overall a fun ride, for anyone over the age of 12.",9.0,18 February 2020

Lots of violent fun.,"By god, if we have to watch moronic super hero movies out the wazoo because they make so much money at the box office - then this bit of vibrant silliness, and eye candy, is just fine.

Behold a silly, ridiculous, colorful, violent, kick-@$$ origin story about a FEMALE superhero group. Much overdue in my opinion. I'm rating this a 9 to off-set all the misogynistic,15-45 year-old jackals who gave it a low rating to keep the littl' women in their places. And btw, my husband even enjoyed this.

Ewan McGregor was both deliciously evil and hilarious in equal turns, and Margot Robbie who is always great in any role, also kept one's attention. Supporting cast of Chris Messina, Rosie Perez et al where fab. I especially enjoyed the antiheroine character of Helena Bertinelli played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead.

A Fun and Enjoyable Ride,"Birds of Prey isn't a movie that is going to impress everyone, but guess what? I don't care. This movie was fun from start to finish and it was clear the cast had an absolute blast during filming. It's jam packed with colour, whether it be the costumes, set pieces or effects. This helps it stand apart from the rest of the DCU which normally employs a more dreary colour pallet. The costumes in themselves deserve more praise because they were so well done. Everyone looked comfortable and relaxed with their wardrobe (especially Margot) which was nice to see after the blatant hyper of Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad. I can't tell you this right now, nobody feels comfortable in shorts that ride that far up.

The action scenes are engaging, well choreographed and easy to follow. The film is backed by an amazing soundtrack that meshes well with the screenplay and re-introduces some old favourites.

This film is great because it doesn't take its self too seriously, it definitely has its tongue in cheek moments. It's an enjoyable little romp that employs intelligent humour, a vibrant colour patent and an overall sense of fun.

If you don't like it? That's fair enough, to each their own. I'm not going to try and convince you otherwise.

But if your looking for a movie that's easy to follow, has a well put together cast and an amusing premise? Give Birds of Prey a shot.",8.0,29 February 2020

"LOVED IT!! Suck it up boys, and get used to it.","Please ignore the many and tragic reviews posted here. This is the movie I wish I could have seen growing up. Chicks kicking, and so obviously made by women, not by men with women in it to for the pleasure of other men. It's fun and funny, super sweary and ultra-violent.

One of the reasons so many critics, a profession that is 85% pale and male, took such a dislike to Birds of Prey is the men are relegated to the roles usually occupied by women. The archetypal girlfriends and secretaries - in this case cops and short order cooks, and a couple of over the top bad guys who may or may not be a couple.

It is sad that so many male viewers and critics are so totally unselfaware that they don't seem to understand why they don't like the movie. They do not see themselves, or the selves they wish they were, represented anywhere. Well, suck it up, boys, and get used to it. Have a tiny taste of what we've had for the last 100 years in movies.

As to the criticisms that it's unrealistic and too far-fetched - get over it. It's an action movie based on a comic book series. Get butter on your popcorn and enjoy.",10.0,22 February 2020

"A hot mess, and not in the way you want it to be","Where do I begin? This movie was a WOMBAT - a Waste Of Money, Brains and Talent (or Time, depending on your perspective). The director was clearly over her head and needs more experience before helming a big-budget action film.

The first error was not developing the supporting characters. Time was spent with the backstories for Huntress and Montoya, but virtually nothing for Black Canary. No explanation of her powers (how she got them, why she passes out when she uses them, etc.) That could have been handled in a 60-to-90 second montage.

Second error? Unnecessary cuts back and forth in time (4 minutes? really??). This got old REAL fast and made no sense.

Third error - voice-over narration. It is a good rule of thumb to be wary anytime a film uses this trope. Sure, in the right hands, it can be effective, but it usually is used when the writer or director doesn't know how to link scenes together.

Fourth error was the lack of convincingly menacing villain. We know Ewan is a good actor, but the material just isn't there for him. And there is ZERO explanation as to why he decided to wear a mask in the final fight sequence? Everybody already knows his character's name. This just looked weird.

The fifth error was the final fight sequence. Over-saturated colors in an amusement park. Holy 1960's Batman! I half expected to see the words BAM and POW superimposed on the screen, a la the old campy Batman television show.

Finally, there is no credible explanation how any of the female leads (generally around 100 to 120 lbs) can effectively and consistently take down much larger male characters in hand-to-hand combat. I'm all for kick ass females, but please make it realistic.

In the end, the writer and director delivered a sloppy mess of a third-rate DC character. It's time to retire Harley Quinn for good.",1.0,19 August 2020

A study of mental illness in the midst of a heist movie,"Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)

A sort of Suicide Squad side step, Birds of Prey follows Harley Quinn after an off screen break up with the Joker. The movie is told from her point of view, which is quite amusing and difficult to follow. The movie is a good case study in bipolar disorder and advanced ADHD, though they seem to be conditions brought on by the toxic chemicals she is submerged in.

As soon as the Joker is no longer in her life, that gives the entire city the message that she cannot get away with whatever she wants any more. Being quite bonkers, she has collected quite the list of people she has harmed. Though nothing will stop her from getting her favorite breakfast sandwich. Oh my goodness do I want to try that sandwich.

The movie also has many nods to long time Batman fans featuring Renee Montoya, Helena Bertenelli, Dinah Lance, Black Mask, Victor Zsasz, and a completely different Cassandra Cain from the source material.

The main plot focuses on Black Mask and Zsasz committing various crimes that affect everyone else. Cassandra is depicted as a young teenage pickpocket who has the great misfortune of stealing a large diamond, and then swallowing it.

Remember, this is all told from the POV of a crazy person. The plot line is not completely linear as Harley's ADHD kicks in. The same scene is shown several times with different parts of the scene appearing after Harley remembers to add that point. She does show empathy at times thus showing her insanity is not quite completely total.

The movie is extremely fun to watch. If it weren't for her antics, acrobatics, creativity with weapons, and emotional outrages, this would be a mediocre crime drama. Thankfully, this is far from mediocre. Margot Robbie does a great job and shines much brighter than being part of the Suicide Squad ensemble.

Another surprise comes from Ewan McGregor as Black Mask. He does so well in the role of an unhinged crime boss that he is almost unrecognizable. To be fair, I didn't recognize him at all at first.

Misses the Mark,"The DCEU is still trying to find its footing in the franchise-obsessed world of Hollywood and continues into the realm of villainy with Birds of Prey (The Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn). Or is it ""Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey?"" Who knows? This movie feels like a sequel to Suicide Squad and isn't much better, having many of the same problems. In this movie, Harley Quinn breaks up with the Joker and seeks out a life of crime of her own, picking up an all-female group of criminal accomplices in the process. The movie does have a nice style to it, but that can only take it so far. It is very disjointed, but that somehow seems appropriate.

While this is the story of her supposed ""fantabulous emancipation,"" nothing really changes with her throughout the movie. She starts as a psychotic criminal who gets herself into trouble and ends as a psychotic criminal who gets herself into even bigger trouble. While Margot Robbie does make an excellent Harley Quinn that feels like the character of the comics, the character arc simply isn't there. The only change is that Joker's not in the picture anymore. Speaking of, the Joker should probably be in the movie. While it's clear no one wants to see Jared Leto as Joker again, especially after seeing Joaquin Phoenix in the role, he's probably the second-most important character in the movie after Harley Quinn. The rest of the cast is pretty forgettable. Which, I suppose, is better than having them be hateable.

Black Mask was a pathetically terrible villain. In the comics, he's a sadistic crime boss with an array of tactics and weapons. Here, he feels like a stereotype of an effeminate gay man. While Ewan McGregor is a good actor and he's not terrible, there's no saving this character. He's just terrible. He also only has his mask on for 30 seconds at most. Such a disgrace. He's still not as bad as Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor or Jared Leto's Joker at least.

While not the worst entry in the DCEU thus far (it's better than Suicide Squad, on par with BvS), it's certainly not their best effort. Given how messy the DC canon is, it's kind of hard to tell if this movie even counts anymore.",4.0,21 July 2021

But no, slow moving wide angles, slow cuts as well as absolutely not syncing cuts with the music in a modern fashion break the spell and make every fault visible in length.

Something fresh and fun,"This move is just... good. Being absolutely honest, I was getting tired of watching superhero movies which are showy, cliche with nonsensical plotlines (looking at you, ""Endgame"").

""Birds of Prey"" is not a revolutionary movie because it's something new in terms of visual effects nor the plot; I'd even say that the latter it is quite simple. It's revolutionary because it's fun and fresh and portrays characters in a natural, relatable way. It was a pleasure to watch the anti-heroes team up and actually help each other.

Additionally, I'd like to thank the director for not making it a comic book movie ""for men""; female characters weren't oversexualized, even the scenes which in any other movie would be made as ""sexy"" or ""seductive"" ones were just... normal. I loved it.

Now, had the 'Birds of Prey' idea kicked in about 1/2 way into the movie, had the main characters taken on the worst of the worst to save the day? Then, that would've been epic. But that was not to be.

Instead you're subjected to 108 minutes that are slow moving, poorly scripted fight scenes and a story line you'd think would never get produced. But here we are. And to think lists that this movie received 10 nominations for awards..

"NOT a ""chick-flick""","Chick flicks- in my honest opinion - are ooey-gooey romance movies about the girl who looses The Guy, but finds another guy and finds love and happiness forever after.

That's not this movie. Unless you count Harley & her egg sandwich.

I loved this movie! Kick-ass women, women of color in the frontlines and the bad guys lose. What more can you ask for in an ""anti-hero"" film?

And the fact that it was produced by one of the main characters?? Yes, please!

I have this sinking feeling that all the men in these reviews clearly can't handle a decently written movie about women who kick butt and don't take no for an answer. And the whole ""men are bad"" take- isn't that every single villain, ever? That they're evil. Ewan does an amazing performance of playing that evil psychopath, tears and all.

Similar to other anti hero films we've seen recently, but in a new colorful tint. We get to explore more of Gotham & the villains that try to take over.

Fantastic performances from everyone. Beautiful cuts and shots.

Overall disappointing,"I'm a huge fan of Margot Robbie as an Actress, she takes on and is successful in a hugley diverse number of roles. Harley Quinn is arguably her best known and although she is a natural as the character it's unfortunate the two films she has appeared in have been disappointing. This film is just another vehicle for this over the top 'feminism is great. Women are so strong' fad of the last few years. Women are strong but this constant obsession with raamming down throats has the opposite effect from the one intended - it makes women seem weak. I felt the constant introduction of characters throughout the film slowed it down somewhat, though the story being told via Harley's point of view was interesting and added something to the film. Ewan Mcgregor was poor as an antagonist and never really had any character arc. He was introduced as a bad guy and just continued along that line with no expansion. The fact he's not a great actor either didn't help. This really was a Harley vehicle with all other characters as bit parts. It's not a bad film, it's not great either. The sooner Hollywood gets over this obsession with 'Girl Power' and gets back to just making good films, with good stories the better.",5.0,13 March 2020

UNLEASH THE MADNESS,,9.0,1 June 2022
I wanted to like it,"I wanted to like it, I really did, I really tried, most action movies I can suspend my disbelief, but the action sequences were so fake I actually felt bored during them. The size differences are laughable, the punches are sometimes pro-wrestling bad, and the storyline is ho-hum, there are no surprises, no twists, and other than Harley, the characters feel very flat.

I don't know what this movie is missing, but I actually felt sleepy during the fight scene in the boomboom room or whatever that building was called.

I kept expecting Harley to use assorted traps or something as it was clear she used to live there. Instead it was just somehow 4 girls beating up over 100 guys, often without weapons. The weapons I cam understand, and Harley's martial arts skills, but the direct strikes from a 100 pound person on a 300 pound person don't feel believable, they don't seem to know martial arts and it shows.

The director and entire cast should be required to attend a UFC training camp for a year as punishment and training for this grade C movie.

What was this movie missing? A second storyline showing WTF the Joker and the Batman were busy doing this entire time. Even if it was just 20 minutes spliced up here and there.

Bottom Line: It feels like a direct made for DVD movie that they only allowed in cinemas because of 'The Agenda' as we're apparently calling it now.",3.0,15 April 2020

I loved this movie,"I'm trying to figure out where all the hate is coming from because I'm shocked at how some people are viewing this movie. I understand that people may have felt burned by Suicide Squad (I personally wasn't hyped for that movie and - like previous DC movies it was a hot mess of very good and very bad things) and I will say that if you hated Suicide Squad with a passion (for whatever reasons) that you probably won't like this movie. Fortunately, one good thing that came out of Suicide Squad was Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley Quinn which is so spot on and comics accurate it's a pure pleasure to watch onscreen. That same performance and visual presence continues through this movie and really leans on Margot's amazing acting abilities by telling her own story, her own way. This is what you're signing up for.

Even though the story isn't the greatest it's so Harley Quinn that I can't help but love it. Watching this movie felt like an R-rated, modern spin-off episode of Batman the Animated Series with a focus on Harley instead of Batman or his other villains. Much like Suicide Squad, the greatest element of this movie are the actors and characters. You could easily argue that the other ""Birds"" were underdeveloped but you'd be kidding yourself if you think we won't see them again; this movie makes me want to see this version of Huntress or Black Canary in more DC movies - there's so much potential with those actresses and characters in the DC-Universe. Give me more!

I do have some minor criticisms. I think they went a little too real with the outfits. Harley looked amazing in every shot but Black Canary and Huntress looked too much like common, generic street thugs. Hopefully by the next movie they look much closer to their comic book interpretations. I think some people are also complaining about what they did with Black Mask's lore and honestly, he's not the greatest Batman villain so I'm glad they tweaked his characterization with Ewan Mcgregor's amazing performance. The action sequences also felt inconsistent but not as bad as I thought they would be since I knew there were re-shoots. I think if every fight scene felt like John Wick but with a badass, female, DC hero/anti-villian instead of Keanu, nobody would be complaining.

Lastly, I think there are some criticisms that are just ridiculous and feel like I have to address. Is this movie anti-male in order to be pro-female? No. I personally think the movie handled its feminist commentary well but others, obviously, disagree. Although these girls kick ass they are far from perfect (no Mary Sues here) and even comment, repeatedly, how nobody likes Harley (but the audience I was in was laughing with Harley the whole time). Does this movie have poor editing? It's either a love it or hate it situation. It's a matter of taste. The editing in this movie is better than Suicide Squad but more disjointed than your common action movie. As I said in the beginning, if you understand Harley as a character, you'll better understand what you're signing up for before watching this movie.

Birds of Prey is another example of social statements overpowering any other element of the movie,"I want to start of by mentioning two really important aspects to this review; the first one, is that I am making this analysis with no knowladge of how Harley Queen is portrayed in the comics, so just from the movie prespective; and secondly I do agree with the importance of social statements in movies, I fully support it and specially these days I even consider it a necessity, but you really need to do it right (looking at you Captain Marvel!) otherwise it compromises the whole film So the movie is set in the same universe as its predecessor Suicide Squad (yes, that mess) this time exploring the famous Joker girlfriend, former psychologist Harley Quinn and her (future) group of vigilantes the Birds of Prey. The tone of the movie resembles a lot Deadpool, being slightly less violent but attempting a similar formula of the empathic mercenary, fourth wall breaker beating her way up to the main vilain!

There are a couple of things that I found negative in the movie, the first being the lack of humanity of Harley Quinn. Sure Deadpool was more of satire than an actual superhero movie, but that's established and as the movie progresses that idea becomes more clear, Harley Quinn on the other end is a villain which of course can be explored not to become a 2 dimensional character however, she is clearly likable and easily made a hero here, which doesn't seem to add up - by the way this also applies to the predecessor Suicide Squad, for pretty much all of those characters, where we are supposed to see a villain or better yet an Anti Hero, we actually see heroes, not much of agrey are there to explore",4.0,16 October 2020
"""The Extravagant Tale of the Harlequin""","""The Extravagant Tale of the Harlequin""

Cathy Yan steps into the spectacular realm of superheroes with a wild ride of a film full of chaos and insanity that straps you in and never lets you go. ""Birds of Prey"" is the latest installment in the troubled DCEU (or whatever they're calling it these days) and places Margot Robbie's wonderful Harley Quinn at the forefront with a batch of fresh faces for a nearly two-hour film that is a solid entry for the franchise. With shades of its predecessors, the entire cast and crew of ""Birds of Prey"" unite to construct a strange rollercoaster of a film that basks in its outrageous style with no retrains and no regrets. When the bubble of superhero films continues to inflate every passing year, it is truly refreshing to watch something in the genre that does not take itself too seriously or have the job of building off of past films and setting up new storylines for the future. ""Birds of Prey"" is as wacky as its full name would suggest; it is a film that takes the characters and locals of the historical DC Universe and views them through a lens of lunacy that will either make audiences laugh or cringe (I experienced the former). ""Birds of Prey"" writer, Christina Hodson crafts a script that brings the legendary Birds of Prey team to the screen eighteen years after their last live-action incarnation. The story picks up with our titular ""hero"" Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) as she narrates the life events that have led to her downward spiral since her untimely breakup with the clown prince of crime himself, the Joker. This breakup has shattered Harley's heart, but given her a new lease on life; a fresh start to define herself as not just the ""Joker's girl"". For the time being, Harley takes refuge in Roman Sionis' aka Black Mask's (Ewan McGregor) nightclub where she becomes acquainted with the talented and lovely singer, Dinah Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) as well as the prideful psychotic killer, Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina). However, in a final effort to destroy the fragments of her past life, Harley decides to demolish the binding place that sealed Harley and Joker's love, Ace Chemicals. The nearby explosion rattles a force of GCPD officers as they are investigating a grizzly murder by committed by the hands of a vigilante known only as, the crossbow killer. Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) hurries over to the ruins of Ace Chemicals and discovers Harley's broken necklace; she quickly realizes that without the Joker's blanket of protection she is in real trouble. Once the grungy criminal underground of Gotham City becomes privy to this news, Roman not only sends his goons on a search to uncover a diamond that holds the secrets to the Bertinelli family fortune, but he decides that going after Harley is also of the utmost importance; because with both objects, he would surely rule over all of Gotham. Through several moments of misfortune, Harley, Dinah, Renee, Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), and Helena Bertinelli (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) all cross paths and must come together with a common cause and assemble to become the Birds of Prey. Despite ""Birds of Prey"" not being a direct sequel to 2016's ""Suicide Squad"", it is hard to not compare the two seeing as how on the outside, a lot of the DNA infused in both films crosses streams almost directly. Production designer K.K. Barrett, art director Kasra Farahani, and costume designer Erin Benach take all of their immense talents and come together to create a world of insanity and madness that displays a visual style that is wild and unmistakable. Every frame is packed with a rich spectrum of color, every set is dressed with a personal approach that focuses on character, and all of the costumes pay homage to their comic book counterparts while making them one of a kind with their own unique flairs. On a visual level, ""Birds of Prey"" stands out from the bland pack of superhero films that flood the market today. The R rating of the movie is another key factor that helps separate itself from the myriad of other films in its genre; sadly, it is not fully used to its full potential. Within the very first ten minutes of the film, a least fifty (probably an exaggeration) f-bombs are dropped simply because it is allowed. The language can at times be seen as a bit juvenile when an expletive must be said within every other line of dialogue. Yet, despite the language feeling excessive and not adding to much of the film, the action is certainly propped up by its rating. In ""Birds of Prey"" the bombastic and erratic action that explodes on-screen is fast and deliberate. The individual set-pieces leading up to the third act are sparse while being quick as to not overstay their welcome; which is a plus. We as the audience get an understanding of the combat styles each of the ""Birds"" employ which is helpful for us to understand what tools each member has in their kit. Harley's brutal close-quarters style makes her a baseball bat-wielding ballerina, Canary's martial art techniques along with her sonically charged screams make her a massive threat, and Huntress' swift fleet-footed movements and mini crossbow give her a distinct range advantage that many of her fellow ""Birds"" can not cover. When all of the ""Birds"" come together combining their individual skill sets in the final act against Black Mask, Yan perfectly encapsulates that fierce violence and paints a memorable scene of blood and fun. However, no matter how much fun the spectacle of the film may be, the script does a disservice to the other ""Birds"" as they hardly get enough screen-time and are never developed in a meaningful way. Everyone outside of Harley evokes the same kinds of emotions at the beginning of the film as they do at the end. With some minor changes sprinkled throughout, most of the characters are depicted as being extremely one-note meaning anyone going into this film who is not already a fan of DC Comics, may not be as interested in them or their stories. Nonetheless, ""Birds of Prey"" bathes in its own extravagant chaos from start to finish which is an attribute that must be commended. Although ""Birds of Prey"" does not utilize all its characters in fantastic ways, there are certainly some standouts that can not go overlooked. Both Ewan McGregor and Chris Messina who play Roman Sionis and Victor Zsasz respectively, deliver two performances that are truly exceptional. McGregor takes the traditional stale mob boss character of Roman and turns him into a deranged, unhinged, psychopath hell-bent on striking fear into anyone who opposes him while showcasing his malevolent power for all to see. Every scene McGregor partakes in is one he instantly steals with the haunting performance he delivers through the atrocious acts he unabashedly loves to engage in. McGregor and by extension Roman, is a true showman with a ton of baggage that is all used to exhibit a true sinister debonair devil. Then there is Messina who plays Roman's right-hand man Victor Zsasz. Messina's performance as this psychopath makes him one of the best characters in ""Birds of Prey"". His unsettling dialogue, tone, and mannerisms will make you feel uncomfortable with every repulsive action he partakes in. Messina flawlessly plays alongside McGregor that bolsters his performance (and vice versa) creating a villainous force that is as remarkable as it is menacing. Any discussion around ""Birds of Prey"" can not be complete without talking about Margot Robbie's deep involvement with the project. Robbie had been shepherding the idea for a ""Birds of Prey"" standalone film starring Harley Quinn for several years before a script was drafted or pre-production even began. Robbie had a detailed plan she believed in and stuck with it until the studio gave her the green light. Her intimate involvement shows as she not only helped produce the project, but she also takes center stage. In many ways ""Birds of Prey"" feels like a completely standalone film for Robbie's whimsical portrayal of Harley Quinn to burst free; which is not a mark against the film as Robbie takes the complexities of this character to new and exciting heights. Robbie takes many emotional leaps forward evolving this character beyond simple eye candy (as she was utilized in ""Suicide Squad"") which is greatly appreciated. Robbie embodies this role with all of her essence and it is appearing as though that in the same way we view Robert Downey Jr. as the Tony Stark, I believe Margot Robbie will be looked at in that same light as the one true, Harley freaking Quinn. ""Birds of Prey"" is a sporadic film that is a blast of fun. The entire cast and crew all bring their best to create a superhero film that feels like nothing the genre has ever seen. Although at times the film will push in a certain direction that can feel a bit unbearable, it always quickly recognizes its strengths and pushes onward showcasing its best attributes. Despite a lackluster script and stunted character development, all of the performances are serviceable with a handful that are absolutely impeccable. ""Birds of Prey"" is a film that is not ashamed of itself nor anything it says or does which is a truly refreshing revitalization that is sorely needed in this bloated cookie-cutter genre that we have all grown accustomed to; that being the ""superhero film"". However, IF we ever see the Birds of Prey unify once more, the other members will need to be further developed and propped up in order to play on Harley's level.

DC's Deadpool,"All and all, I definitely did not hate this film, which I thought I would. It has its positives and negatives, but overall not what I expected. One of the things I enjoyed about this movie was Margrot Robbie's performance. She absolutely crushes it as Harley Quinn, and she is very funny and entertaining to watch. I also loved the villian. He was smart, creepy, manipulative, and very unsympathetic. The aspects I did not like about this movie were the other characters, and the overall story. The story and vibe of the film felt like a rip off from Deadpool. I dont blame them for going this route, especially with a character like Harley Quinn. However, it crossed the line when it became blatantly obvious that it was cashing in on the success of Marvel. This seems to be a common trait (with some exceptions) in the DCEU, and I wish they made their films feel more original.",5.0,12 February 2020

The title is the worst,"This movie should never have been called Birds of Prey, they probably did it to sell merch.

Post-reality Fun House,"If Americans are so irreverent to European traditions, why do children's cartoons and graphic novels (comic books) introduce us to characters based on commedia dell'arte, a tradition of improvisatory Italian folk theater? The biggest revelation I got from watching Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey is that the main character's name is a parody of ""Harlequin."" (After all, I only saw bits and pieces of Suicide Squad on television for the past year and never even heard of the Saturday morning cartoon debuting her three decades ago.) I saw this film on a Thursday afternoon, paid $11, and was the only person in the theater. I had heard it was all but tanking at the box office, so didn't expect much. I had not even researched if I was to be in the DC or Marvel universe (let alone cared that much which). Other expectations I took with me were that Thanos already showed us you can only blow up the universe a few more times before it gets dull; Scorsese taught us guilt for being curious about these post-cinema comics creations; a retaliating AARP invented new cinema awards for grownups; but Joaquin just won an Oscar for portraying Harley Quinn's ex-boyfriend. That and a couple of routine curses to the Libertarians for exchanging our once promising Star Trek future into a Mad Max one. So, this slow-cooking razzle-dazzle about fighting chicks who do slow-mo cartwheels accompanied by lots of rock and rap music sneaks into an arid February release slot. In a panic, the studio even truncates the title. Villain-protagonist Harley Quinn brings us plenty of moral ambiguity. It's Kill Bill territory or even Pulp Fiction's ""Fox Force Five,"" as well as Tarantino's convoluted narrative and skewed timeline. Margot Robbie herself co-produces this most confident Harley Quinn incarnation, with only a few CGI explosions and a pet hyena as sole CGI creature. Rosie Perez deadpans her way as crusty detective who turns to join forces with fem vigilantes. Fresh off Dr. Sleep comes a solid supporting role for Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis, a.k.a. ""Black Mask,"" a sociopathic kingpin, sexually immature, who cruses for bruises and gets them from high-kicking, grenade-tossing girls. Kooky gender warfare. That leaves seething Mary Elizabeth Winstead (unrecognizable from Death Proof and Die Hard IV) as edgy, crossbow-wielding ""Huntress;"" Jurnee Smollett-Bell as smooth crooner in tight pants named ""Black Canary;"" and Ella Jay Basco as pathetic teen pickpocket caught in the middle of it all. Fellow chick Cathy Yan directs only her second feature, first entirely in English, with style and humor. No need to spoil a plot that is barely necessary anyway. Find your way into this post-reality fun-house of effects that jump into your lap and other colorful surprises and there will be a sense you've been thrilled as you step out of the theater. This genre may be short-lived and shallow, but get yours while the getting is good.",9.0,16 February 2020
Why does DC do this?,"So I'm not a fan of comic books, I like them, but do not know any source material. Always loved superhero films. Well, at least Marvel films and maybe a couple DC. DC displays an amazing trailer for each movie they produce, but it just doesn't hold up the weight come showtime.

Plot- Harley gets wrapped up hunting a diamond and also fending off a gangster that wants it. Easy stuff.

Characters/Acting- All amazing actors, Ewan and Margot were stellar per usual. Characters weren't all interesting.

Writing- I think all the good dialogue was meant for Harley Quinn. Otherwise there's just room left for jabs at gender roles n stuff to please feminists (all for it when it counts but I'm JUST trying to watch a movie)

Quality- Yeah yeah yeah, we get it, girl director, girl cast, girl everything, every single song by a female artist. It's like yeah thats cool but something about it seemed forced. And iI was honestly disappointed with the action. A PROFUSE AMOUNT OF HIGH KICKS. Literally made every characters fighting style look like Patrick Swayze.

Overall, I think we should just wait for what James Gunn has to offer. If the bar wasn't set so high for superhero flicks, this movie would seem better, but it just doesn't bring in anything exciting. Bummed.",4.0,5 June 2021
No One Can Play Harley Better Than Margot Robbie! No One.,"'Birds of Prey' is a perfect example of how one should make an Action-Comedy. It packs enough humour alongside some pretty great action and a bunch load of scenes with Harley Quinn just being herself; frankly can't ask for more.

Cathy Yan, the director did a phenomenal job balancing the tonality of the film. She created a perfect blend where the Action or the Comedy never cuts each other much and one can definitely enjoy both the aspects equally well.

Cinematography and the Sound score both played major parts and certainly improved the overall execution on the plate. And I must mention how well structured the screenplay is and how much the quirky editing helped in regards of the prefixed vibe. The movie moves with Harley Quinn's Narration. As we all know her character is a nutjob so the technicalities were similarly chosen keeping that perspective in mind. Great job on that!

Now moving on to the performances. Man oh Man! Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn Is unbeatable. She is just perfect for the role. I couldn't even imagine anyone but her playing such psychotic yet complexed character. Her eyes, posture, way of delivering dialogues; she got herself so deep into this particular role that is discernible via her hardwork and dedication both on and off the screen. The others characters were decent but a lack of attentiveness towards them and their individual backstories resulted in just an okayish representation of the same. Ewan McGregor as Black Mask has done real good and I really wanted to see him getting his due back by each of the protagonists by the end! That could have been the perfect climax. Alas! That wasn't too be. It ended rather quickly!

Is it Insane? Yeah. Is it Quirky and over the top perhaps? Yeah Definitely; but that's how a movie based upon 'Harleen Quinzel aka Harley Quinn' should be. One of the best coming from DC for sure!

Highly recommended.",8.0,9 July 2020

I loved this movie,"I am a female and growing up I have never seen so much focus on female characters being their unapologetic selves. It's refreshing to see women be portrayed as powerful, but also stupid, funny, that know how to enjoy a sandwich or two and to be able to pickpocket on the streets rather than just being useless eye candy that are always the victim to be saved by a handsome buff dude and/or the sexual/romantic prize after some heroic struggle. I don't understand why people are complaining (understandable from the comic fans) about it being ""man-hating"". This movie has the typical beat down of men that you would see in any action movie, the only difference is that there were awesome fight scenes involving ladies (especially when it was lady against lady!) and that for once, a team of all women won collectively against the evil henchmen through a silly but heartwarming alliance. Yay! If you don't like the ""political agenda"" of this movie, there are plenty of Seth Rogen movies to remind you of how awesome your manhood is. As for the arc and overall plot, it is definitely not the best and it's not trying to be. If you want a cinematic masterpiece, go watch Parasite. This is a movie for good laughs and a big F U to typical helpless bimbo eye candy tropes that female characters are subjected to. Overall, I think Cathy Yan did a great job of balancing action with comedy along with clever insertions of female allyship (the hair tie scene was so subtle but hilariously relatable). Would definitely watch again for the laughs.",8.0,27 February 2020
"This movie is the equivalent of a trashy chick who gets hammered at a bar and thinks she's being ""funny"" by ruining everyone's night","Had to turn this off at some point because it was giving me a headache, the movie is literally unwatchable. The screeching, crass-without-being-funny dialogue feels like listening to nails on a chalk-board. The movie also has an absolutely HORRIBLE soundtrack and some of the visuals just look godawful. It's violent for no reason, the characters are all screaming idiots and the plot makes no sense at all. Margot Robbie also completely misses the mark, her character is just unbearable and at no point are you rooting for her to succeed in any way. I just wanted her to stop...

It really is an assault on all senses, this movie makes 'Man of Steel' look like 'Citizen Kane'.",4.0,15 April 2020
The madcap misadventure of Harley Quinn,"This installment of the saga of the DC Comics universe takes us into the life of Harley Quinn after the events of Suicide Squad. A Harley trying to get on with her life until a series of events intrude. This movie features a lot of fun black humor and drops the PG13 rating for a more adult tone that works well. It has a good dose of action, black humor and excellent shots. Margot Robbie is great in her role as Harley Quinn, she brings a lot of grace and spirit to the character. Mary Elizabeth Winstead also does a good portrayal of Huntress, but her character had such an interesting backstory that I wish she had been given more relevance. Ewan McGregor fits very well in his role as Black Mask, but he is a rather cartoonish villain who can rarely be taken seriously. The concept of the film isn't too bad, but it does feel somewhat generic. Interestingly, most of the villains are male and that makes one have certain ideas about the image of the film. Even so, it is not so bad and more if you take it with a certain humor. This Harley Quinn movie turns out to be entertaining, but it would have worked better with a better script and Zack Snyder as a producer. My rating for this movie is 8/10.",8.0,21 March 2023

Lacking,"I get that Harley Quinn is an overtop character but Margot Robbie's acting is so overtop your watching her and not the film. She nails it in suicide squad, making her a shining light in that film, however it seems this is a case of 'to much of a good thing'. Fight scenes are poorly executed, especially ones with Rosie Perez as she can barely move. Jurnee Smollett is to this film what Miss Robbie was to suicide squad. Her fight scenes flow, her timing spot on. With believability in her acting. There are some funny moments. The story is ok but the over narration seems a desperate attempt to win over Deadpool fans.",4.0,2 July 2020
Birds of prey and the fantabulous emancipation of one Harley quinn,"Admittedly speaking, remember there was a time when DC Universe was bashed because most of their movies were directed by Zack Snyder who decided that style-over-substance was more pivotal to making superhero films? Then, came David Ayer with a set of the best movie trailers ever created but the outcome for the anti-hero film, Suicide Squad was at best, a mediocre motion picture.

Now after Shazam!, Aquaman & the masterpiece Joker, DC presents us with Birds of Prey, the fourth entry movie that proves that their tables have pretty much turned around by finding suitable directors for their movies and that they are catching up to compete with the Marvel Universe. No feud here please.

Here's my thoughts on Birds of Prey:

The movie features slick action scenes which complete with very acrobatic-like choreography that constantly pleases the eyes of everyone who are looking forward for femme fatales kicking ass. There are plenty of them to keep you amazed.

Birds of Prey also delivers a vigorous energy throughout, it feels like you are high on drugs. The close-ups feel very intimate yet feel very caricature in a positive way. The quality of cameras & the colour palette capture a reality of life, giving a sense of how rough it actually is, very dark and gritty but... also sometimes sprinkles the dour tone with graciously boisterous and delicate tinted colours. The occasional slo-mo ampes up the already intense energy.

Some of you might have asked regarding the feminist movement. Birds of Prey is a done right feminist film. A key successful factor to driving a feminist film is to create an innate story on women without being pushy on the political agenda. Birds of Prey does that. Another thing is this is not a guy-turn-girl remakes (Yes, I'm watching you Ghostbusters & Ocean's 8). And BOP does not or rarely knocks down the men genes as weak or indecisive. Kudos Birds of Prey!

Now, let's talk about Margot Robbie & Mary Elizabeth Winstead. These two really go beyond the next level to dive into their character as uniquely as possible. Margot Robbie as always should be receiving a standing ovation as Harley Quinn again, after the meh Suicide Squad. She restrains from letting anyone steals her spotlight. If her and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker are caught together in a love story, it will be the best romance movie of the decade. The complexity and different types of deranged personalities they uphold. Wow! Winstead as Huntress is the runner up here, she gives out a hot breeze of aura that it is hard to back away from. Her charismatic sexual energy captures the attention like a bullseye 🎯. Bell as Black Canary is cool, but not as great as the other two. Bella as Cain shows to be mischievous but her character only pretty much follows where the major characters take her.

It also offers decent humour overall. Harley Quinn is consciously great in this, her facial movements contribute a lot! Some are fresh from the oven, others are a bit obsolete but those humours though feel old keep us glued to the screen.

Final battle, the best thing is the lack of unrealistic weaponry that they occupy which makes it all feels so real. It is entertaining and fun too as there are certain scenes that feature a low amount of quick cuts.

Now, the most detectable problem with this movie is it spends so much time on character development of the all-girls group that it forgets that they can excite the audience with the combo pack. An hour later and they are still focusing on so many character devs!

Because of this, the relationship between members of Birds of Prey is very shadowy and leaves an unsatisfied feeling by the end. Like somehow they have been forced exponentially to know and work with one another.

So many developments but they forget Roman's character, the main antagonist which feels quite underdeveloped. When a scene of him pops up especially after 40% of the film, it really wants to tell something meaningful about him, but eventually moves on with it,",8.0,7 June 2020

More Tank Girl than Deadpool.,"I finally got round to watching this, having mixed reviews I wasnt too keen on spending the cash to see this at the cinema but home for home viewing its fine. While the usual ""its a woman"" movie complainers have tried their best to force people to avoid this movie, having watched it its not really a feminist movie. It just happens to be a movie that has women in it. I couldn't see a single incidence of male bashing throughout. And thats something I am always critical of. The tone of the film is a bit strange for a superhero movie of that universe. It doesn't have at times nasty humour of Deadpool but nor does it have the same level of engagement. Thats my main issue with this movie. It sort of just happens. For example the fighting scenes have almost zero tension. Its simply one or a number of women beating up men who fail to land a single blow on the women. The outcome is that there is no risk or peril involved. Its like a shooting gallery and I found myself checking my phone. It does have the tone of a comic book adaption, probably more so that any of the recent super serious Marvel movies and it reminded me mostly of Tank Girl. As for storytelling, it does jump around alot and not in a satisfying way. I found this frustrating at times as would have preferred a linear narrative. Visually its well done and the cast is decent although its basically a Harley movie, the rest of the main cast are basically an add on for the final half hour. Worth a watch and while girls may enjoy this more than boys its certainly not pushing a feminist narrative or is anti-male in any way. Its just a female led story.",5.0,23 March 2020
Good for a somewhat satisfying one and done viewing.,"@garcwrites : Birds of Prey is essentially an Harley Quinn movie with some sidekicks. It's pretty good. The movie has some redeeming qualities, because the best things about it is sort of brought down by the bad ones to settles smack in the middle of that line, or the hedge of that cliff that would make it a bad movie.

The story is just ok, it's nothing to write ad nauseam about, but it has enough little gems that with some ""more"" work, it could have been a stellar script. The fact the story is told out of order is not a problem but it's actually one of the good things about it. It goes well with the tone of Harley. There are moments in the film that doesn't make sense even if the action is amazing at times.

I'm not too familiar with the comic book counterparts of some of the characters featured in the film so maybe my impressions on the actor's portrayal is skewed. Let's talk start with the good ones, Jussie Smollett-bell as Dinah Lance / Black Canary is amazing, she's likable, believable and very good in the rôle even if she's a bit short-changed by the script. Chris Messina is so good as Victor Zsasz that you forget the lovable guy from The Mindy Project or whatever other role you've seen him in. Ewan McGregor was good but cringy at times, he's one of the ones where I'm asking myself if my lack of knowledge on his character, Black Mask, might be the problem. Besides, I thought the guy was suppose to be queer. There was some queer coding between him and Zsasz but that's an outdated ploy to placate to the queer community with this semblance of representation that I'm going to pretend it wasn't there in the first place. As for Cassandra Cane the actress is nice and all but grossly miscast knowing what I know about the character. Rosie Perez is kind of wasted in this movie because her presence doesn't bring much. And Mary Elizabeth Winstead is simply weird and awkward as Huntress and again maybe it's me not knowing the character too well or it's the way she chose to play the character? The story doesn't help her, her weapon of chose, the crossbow, has no meaning behind and looked out of place. Margot Robbie is a good Harley Quinn but Kaley Cuoco is so good in the animated show that Robbie pales a bit in comparison.

The thing I liked the most in this movie was the action, there's not enough of it but what's there, is entertaining as hell. Now Harley Quinn makes sense in a fight; Black Canary is so badass that her ability becomes an afterthought. The fighting styles are effective and suits these two characters. The cinematography is pretty cool as well.

Birds of Prey leans into Suicide Squad in areas it should avoid it like the plague. There's enough good for a somewhat satisfying one and done viewing.",5.0,25 March 2020
Best non-serious film I've seen in a while,"I haven't read the comics, so I had no expectations for Birds of Prey, other than that Harley Quinn would be great, given that she was (in my view) the best part of Suicide Squad. In Birds of Prey, most of the boring and cringey parts of Suicide Squad are replaced by more awesome Harley Quinn. Emancipated from gimmicky sidekick role, Margot Robbie revels as Harley Quinn, and it's a joy to watch. Harley Quinn's a celebration of violence, intelligence, humour and unpredictablity, and Margot Robbie is great in the action scenes too, many of which are impressively performed and choreographed, worth rewinding to catch slivers of wtf moments. Apart from a slow section near the end, the film moves fast and entertainingly. Ewan McGregor plays Black Mask well but he and the other actors mostly fill out the background to Margot Robbie and Harley Quinn. That might disappoint fans of the comics but it's perfectly fine with me. Given this liberating upgrade of Harley Quinn and Margot Robbie's action skills, I look forward to more!",9.0,2 October 2020

Harley Quinn: Birds Of Prey Film Review - Cathy Yan Directs Margot Robbie Tripping As A Badass With Glitter Bombs & Egg & Bacon Sandwiches,"Cathy Yan directs Birds of Prey and...Harley Quinn, and who knew that Harley Quinn was a PhD, certainly not me. Our girl as a bonafide psychologist. I remember how she talked down the fire eating Diablo of Suicide Squad in the trailer - no alcohol for you. And it's a great asset in bat crazy Gotham. I saw the film opening day, before the name change, and I didn't know the DC Birds of Prey so think switching the name around is the right move. It's Margot Robbie's movie. And in the wild weather of half-term a trip to see Harleen Quinzel may be just what the doctor ordered.



Even if Harley is having a hard time getting over Mr J. She narrates how they met when she was his doctor in Arkham and pledged their love in a vat of acid. But when Joker dumped our girl she took matters into her own hand and blew up the very spot where they had once celebrated said love. Take that Joker, and don't acid rain on Harley's parade! Ever again. Except she's all alone now, apart for her hyena Bruce. After Wayne of course. And he's so adorable, in crazy world of course.



So Harley starts her cartoon life with a whimper; slurping cheese from a can, chopping her hair and getting plastered while ordering the shots. Even taking up roller derby as a (non-contact!) sport. Ice-skating seems so tame now. But because she's Joker's girl she's untouchable outside of her apartment. But what if the bad boys of Gotham found out Harley is flying solo now? Chief among them being Ewan McGregor's Roman Sionis, a big Gotham crime lord. And it's a wild ride of a story with his nom de plume Black Mask. I'm not sure where the name came from (DC history and all that) but Roman likes his African antiquities.

But Harley isn't the only bird in Gotham with attitude. And in need of emancipation. Rosie Perez is a tough talking detective in the Gotham PD, but her Montoya never gets the credit for any of her busts. She finds Harley's necklace just after the acid blast and realises Harley is on her own. As do all the Gotham criminals on the grapevine. Harley has a target on her back. But Monoya is already chasing a killer who just took out a crew with a crossbow. Execution style. Someone really didn't like those bad boys. Turns out Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress has a ton of history with Gotham. Her real name is Helena Bertinelli, and her family were slain in an eye popping display of blood when she was a child. She understandably wants those involved dead. And Jurnee Smollett-Bell is Dinah Lance, the Black Canary with the killer voice who sings for her supper at Roman's club. She was awesome with a roundhouse kick.

Throw in the Bertillini diamond that Roman could make his fortune with, Ella Jay Basco's young pickpocket Cass finds it all very easy to swallow. Although it will be harder to recover. Roman has an idea, but Harley's option is the non lethal route. And comes with a Marilyn riff that was totally fantastic in an out of mind experience.

There's plenty of glitter and colourful smoke bomb style violence. Harley is nothing if not stylish. Armed with her beloved bat. But at the end of the day she's just a girl who wanted to be loved. And when the chips are down with Roman calling out for Gotham's worst to come do their finest to recover his diamond, she and the girls know how to get the job done in a riotous fun house. And it's a wrestlemania with choreographed mayhem. And maybe just maybe they can blow the whole Kerpow style comic book of psychopaths to their mutual, and a tasty egg and bacon sandwich, with cheese, satisfaction.

You go girls. With a great cast Cathy Yan passes the Bechdel test, these women don't need men, and Matthew Libatique makes the screen fizz with his cinematography and K.K. Barrett production design. That fun house was awesome.

But does anyone really die in Gotham? Stay tuned.",10.0,27 February 2020

"Fun, Entertaining, Surprising - Women can have comics too","Comic book fan boys hate this movie because it was made by women for women. I loved Suicide Squad but liked this better. It was about Harley's life and personality, not about her sex appeal or body. Its about women living in a world that doesn't revolve around men. Does that make it feminist? Nah. Just real. And also not like 99% of the movies that Hollywood comes out with. Women want their own superheroes, and anti-heroes, and action movies too - not just rom-coms and period dramas.

The costumes and sets are colorful and vibrant. The action scenes are creative and not seriously over the top (there are no men jumping onto moving helicopters). There's a bit of violence and gore but its not shockingly gratuitous. There is mostly hand to hand combat. There are not 234 kills in this movie (I guess that's what the boys are missing).

And Harley gets to have a heart and friends - she's not just some over- the-top schizo dancing around and bobbing her ponytails around.

Imma gonna go ahead and ignore the comic fan boys' opinions on the internet just like I ignore them in real life.

They quite obviously try to push a message of empowerment but fail horribly at it.

Jolly good bubble gum action flick! What's there to not like?!,"First, i'm a male and i watch a lot of films. I thought Suicide Squad was quite bad! I love Margot and so i had to watch this movie. Went in with my wife with zero expectations. To our surprise the movie was kick-ass and both of us enjoyed the film completely!

It was very refreshing to see the female angle, i don't think any other movie does this as convincingly and this is the very thing that makes the movie special! There is one very short scene where a woman is kind of shamed a bit (avoiding any spoilers here), typically this sort of scene is almost always shot in a somewhat arousing way, but here even the slightest bit of glorification of this perversion is completely removed in this movie. This was quite mind-blowing to a seasoned movie buff like me, really, and makes one wonder how almost all movies are tainted by this creeping testosterone influence!

They also, to my great relief, didn't do any of the women empowerment/feminism crap as well.This would have been a great let-down if they had gone that way, and thankfully steered clear from shoving any political ideas down our throats. This is simply a movie with all the main characters having a lot of fun, only they are all girls this time. The women mostly look normal, and not overly objectified - this was very refreshing to watch. Ewan McGregor kept us chuckling all the way through - he totally nailed his character! You can basically let out a chuckle at every line he delivers. And of course, Margot, the queen of Hollywood herself, effortlessly carried the film on her shoulders and did an amazing job of it! Harley Quinn in this film is more like a very impulsive,highly distracted and slightly crazy girl! She is bundle of joy throughout the film and has an amazing command of the screen-space.The other actors were good enough, and i wouldn't go so far to say anyone's acting was bad per se.

Action scenes could have been better towards the end- this is the only little thing that was slightly lacking, in my opinion. Although, I'm really glad that they didn't overuse CGI.

The saving grace of the film is it never took itself too seriously. This is a very well made fun-flick for those with a broad mind and a good sense of humour.

The movie is much better than the Avengers-Endgame which i watched last year. I thought that movie was absolutely boring with an overdose of CGI, bad acting, flat dialogues. Birds of Prey, on the other hand, had better acting, was much more fun, funny, colourful(!), and left me leaving the theater with a big smile across my stupid face!

It takes too much time to get into real story because it was introducing every characters and their history so it was difficult to connect to story at the first hour but after that is was a fun ride.there is no male Character to support the movie and all males are villains, idiots.to be frank this whole movie fells like male vs female movie.

Margot Robbie does pretty well as the lead character but there is no drama, no tension, little genuine comedy, a cardboard villain and a non-sensical plot all of which leads to a poor film. The fact that Batman vs Superman, Man if Steel and to a lesser extent Suicide squad suffer the same issues speaks volumes.

"So so, but better than most DC movies","The good: As usual with all DC movies the production value's good. Good costumes, camera angles, and editing. The characters were pretty good. I'm a fan of Margot's interpretation of Harley and I'm s huge Ewan McGregor fan. Plus, huntress and ther other one was okay. And the action was good and well choreographed.

The bad: Not a huge fan of Rosie Perez tho. And tbh none of the characters had avy real good character arcs. Ther story is by far the weakest. I'm not a fan of going backwards then forwards when avoidable. They could have told the story in chronological order and eliminated most of the flashbacks. Ther comic relief was short sided and fell flat most of the time.

They could have done better.",5.0,12 April 2020
Not a high quality popcorn movie,"I've always liked the take on Harley Quinn's character played by Margot Robbie in the DCEU. Had a somewhat decent expectation approaching this film, and well... it has certainly exceeded my expectations, not in a good way though.

I can forgive this movie having a forgettable boring plot, tbf we aren't watching superhero movies to get enlightened. Then again this film present you with a groups of unlikable, unoriginal characters: the mid-age policewoman running around achieving nothing, an annoying kid with family issues who is the McGuffin and being a pain in my ass half of the runtime, an assassin woman with cheesy revenge backstory introduced halfway into the film, a singer/driver woman with hidden superpower reveled in a deus ex machina fashion. Thanks to the writers, even Harley Quinn is somehow crazier and stranger in this film.

Its a mass-produced superhero film catering towards younger female audiences, has decent fighting choreograph, standard CGI performance, has a few good sound tracks and that's about all the good things i can say about it. Watched it because of Harley Quinn, and walked out realizing I don't actually like her that much. If there's one character benefited from this movie, it has to be the Joker, Birds of Prey made me understand he's choice to dump Harley.

Overall maybe 5 or 4 out of 10.",4.0,13 May 2024
da,"After a badass and scintillating turn as the naughty kaleidoscopic vixen Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad.

Margot Robbie gets her own spin off squad. The Birds of Prey but this feels like more of a chaotic Harley Quinn standalone movie with some new members bolted on.",1.0,14 December 2021
Okay,"This movie tried too hard.

Margot Robbie was good as the titular Harley Quinn and I wouldn't be mad if I got to see more movies with her as that character. Ewan Mcgregor was really hamming it up as Black Mask and it's not his performance I hate, it's how they write him, man did they make him horrible in this movie. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was good and the character was also well-done. The action in the last 20 minutes was also very good and fun.

Now time for me to say mean things, first, since I already touched on it, I hated Black Mask in this movie. He was just so badly written and his death was equally horrible. Also this movie rips off Deadpool in a couple ways, one being Harley narrating the movie, it worked in Deadpool because it was Deadpool narrating Deadpool, but in this it's it Harley Quinn narrating a Birds of Prey movie. Also the part where the characters team up was extremely sudden and it felt very jarring for me and didn't work. Also a dash of bad CGI doesn't hurt, right? Right?!

I won't be revisiting this anytime soon.",5.0,14 April 2020
Just awful,"Between the feminist fantasy of how men behave to the overreach of the physical expectation of a slight Margot Robbie, this is a bad, bad film. Margot Robbie is a great acress, but the biggest failing of this film, despite all of the opportunity for CGI, edititing and every other trick is that she was set up as an equivalent to a powerful, male lead. I don't know why. There's hint that they writers tried to write in her winning through wit, cunning and smarts but so many of the fight scenes are presented like she was a man with the result that the people she is beating, attacking, pummelling appear to spend half their time waiting for her to hit them. It's a female-led production. How could they have let her down so much? The bits inbetween the action look and feel like a fly on the wall documentary at times as she walks around between weak set-pieces like some talking to the camera reality documentary. Was this written as a quick to market cash-in? It feels like it. An actress of this calibre deserves far, far better.",2.0,15 October 2020
Fast track downhill,"This film started as a 7-8, but in the last half hour went from a bit messy with a lot of potential for a good finale (both plot and cinematography wise) to a complete incoherent disaster. It went down to a 6 as soon as 'the birds of prey' came together, that just felt really weird and their action sequences just didn't connect like how the police station raid from just Harley Quinn managed to do excellently earlier in the movie. However, it became super bad once the antagonist (Ewan McGregor) arrived to the scene and black canary went from badass singer/driver to having a supernatural sonic scream blast that just wiped out and entire army of gangsters... That was just too much for me. This film could've been pretty good, especially considering the first and second acts, but not only failed to deliver, it utterly disappointed in the finale. 4/10 for me. Don't watch past the first hour or so.",4.0,28 March 2020

Not a better one,"I appreciate DC working on female lead comic movies before marvel kick starts with their characters. But, in this movie DC failed to deliver what Marvel does.

Harley Quinn = DC's Deadpool,"There are certain actors who have been cast excellently in comic book movie leading roles. Among those, is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" offers a look at Gotham's crime-filled underworld with our totally unhinged leading lady, the aforementioned, Ms. Harley Quinn. Before this movie was released, director, Cathy Yan, stated that the film was influenced by other films including ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Leon: The Professional"". When you watch the movie, you can obviously tell that the films did play a huge role in the story. In spite of the movie being called ""Birds of Prey"", the movie actually belongs to Harley Quinn. She becomes this person who has nothing left and finds herself in this chase for a kid to save her life. Like Suicide Squad, the film has a unique style and appearance almost as if Harley herself was the production designer for this movie. The soundtrack goes well with every scene where each song was meticulously placed. In case you didn't know, this movie is rated R, meaning that they were allowed to curse, show more grotesque violence and just have fun with it. This is a technique that worked well for Deadpool, another R-rated comic book film. There's even some parts of the movie that reminded me a lot of Deadpool and Deadpool 2 (You'll know what I mean if you stay through the credits). Other characters in this movie include Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), the film's lead villain who reminded me a lot of Dennis Hopper from 'Blue Velvet' for some reason. There's also a determined cop named Renee Montoya played by a still-wonderful Rosie Perez, a tough singer, named Dinah Lance (Jurnee Smollet-Bell), an assassin seeking vengeance named Helena Bertinelli ( Mary Elizabeth Winstead) , and a pickpocket-thief wanted by everyone named Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco). Together they bring the story of the Birds of Prey to life.",,8 February 2020

Refreshing enough in several aspects despite its familiarity and predictability.,"In the current landscape of superhero movie saturation, Birds of Prey is refreshing enough in several aspects that allow it to overcome some of its familiarity and predictability.

Margot Robbie carries the film marvellously even at its most turgid; the vivaciousness of her Harley Quinn is a breath of fresh air for the genre, let alone the fact that this a prominent female lead (of which there are still not enough, Marvel). Robbie genuinely sells the notion that she is both deeply invested in, and genuinely relishing, such a role, and as such Birds of Prey swells with a sense of fun and levity.

Narratively, Birds of Prey makes some interesting structural choices that validate its use of a framing device, even if the story is as rote as any other superhero film in recent memory. There are tones of Deadpool here that don't work quite as well as within that particular franchise, but there is a charm to the degree of meta even if the nature of the character doesn't accommodate for such bold breaking of the fourth wall.

Notably, Cathy Tan's direction possibly renders this the first superhero movie in which the female characters' behaviours genuinely make everyday sense, with subtle details and sly nods - passing a hair bobble during a fight - included which make the ensemble seem organic. While the fight choreography teeters on complacent, there is a use of bright colour which makes for an appealing, refreshing aesthetic that will capture the viewers' attention where the bland fisticuffs won't.

A sound, if not stellar effort, Birds of Prey has more than enough assets - and knows more than enough about how to utilise them - to make it as interesting as any other film of its ilk, while establishing a unique identity of its own.",,7 March 2020
Birds of Prey,"I haven't even seen the movie but I just wanna say, SCREW THE HATERS!!!!! *dab* this film is LIT!!!!!!!!!",,27 March 2021
Not As Bad As The Hate Hype Will Have You Believe,"I was expecting a very vapid, trite and predictable sexist romp a la Ghostbusters, that film was just fine until somewhere in the middle it lost all steam and it seemed to have been handed over to somebody completely disinterested in making a watchable film. I managed to watch this film for a lot longer than I expected and somehow made it to the end. I think it's hilarious that women have a vehicle like this to make men realize how silly and ridiculous they view most, if not ALL of the Marvel/DC. Luckily this film has some entertainment value added to it and it's not just a straight up sneer at the sausage fest that is comic book hero fandom. The soundtrack is half decent, minus the hiphop/rap interludes and the severely cringey rendition of ""This is a Man's World"" obligatory scene. If you can take a little (well deserved) men bashing and obviously a big suspension of reality you'll end up applauding the whole thing and the toxic discourse it inevitably brings to social media. It ALMOST fits well with the recent Joker movie and the atrocious Suicide Squad malaise is nowhere in sight (or smell). Hell, I even enjoyed this more than that highly praised Wonder Woman movie. So disregard the hate and hopefully this movie will get a little more respect, not to say it's a classic in any respect but it's gotten DC a thumbs up from me and that's rare to admit.",,1 July 2020
Bad Deadpool,Dude. What is this movie? It is trying to be a female Deadpool but it doesn't get the one element of Deadpool that worked. CHARACTER. DC. You can't have your main character narrate all of the film explain everyone's story and actually expect me to care what happens to generic kid in an R-rated movie. Not cancerous but the script is utter trash. Definitely a skippable movie. But it has redeeming moments here and there.,,18 May 2020
