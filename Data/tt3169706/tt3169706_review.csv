Superb... but then I'm biased.,"A fabulously rich movie with a superb mix of talent relating the victories of human relationships over and above the overwhelming power of political ideology in partnership with business.

Bill Nighy plays a beautifully understated, quiet and thoughtful role in contrast to the ebullient Imelda Staunton, matriarchal doyenne of the small Welsh mining town that is the focus for solidarity expressed by LGSM. Paddy Considine as Dai is the somewhat unwitting emissary who meets with the group in London and speaks powerfully and clearly to the community there and to the rather more conservative community in his home town as to the nature of solidarity. Much humour is placed in the two cultures coming together and throughout there are themes of coming out, for both communities; the subtle and insidious nature of discrimination, the hegemonic control it exerts when backed by powerful media presentation, the opportunism of the bitter and resentful, and the damage that is wrought upon families and communities when work is alienated from the individuals identity. Jessie Cave, Ben Schnetzer, Sophie Evans, George Mackay and Freddie Fox all perform keenly and will have done their rising stars no harm here. Not sure how this film will travel internationally, a bit parochial, but then I thought the same about Billy Elliott and that seems to have done OK.

Culturally the film is a trip down memory lane, the music, the politics, the clothing and decor all take me back to 1984, the year of my eighteenth birthday, when my father was one of those striking miners, my mother and the other mothers ran the kitchen in the local church hall. Hence my bias, there is much in this film that is intensely personal.but even if this were not the case, I would still recommend the artistry of this movie and it's passion to anyone.",9.0,9 September 2014
Life-enhancing,"PRIDE commemorates the hitherto unremarked but nevertheless remarkable alliance between Welsh miners and London lesbians and gay men. It is an enjoyable, well-made, sometimes uplifting, movie set in a bleak period of British history. It is a political film, in the best sense: it's about people joining together to take control of their own destinies, a theme which has a long history in UK cinema, going back at least to the fantasy of PASSPORT TO PIMLICO (1949) to the based-on-fact MADE IN DAGENHAM (2010).

It is well-scripted, beautifully directed, skillfully and enjoyably acted. I have one niggle. Not so much with this film in particular, but rather with all those setting out to please a mass-audience whilst also trying to deal with serious issues. The times in which PRIDE is set were very dark, but I don't know that a mainstream movie can make it clear for those that weren't there just how dark they were. The film goes some way to showing it, but it can't really plumb the depths because - well, mainstream movies can't and still stay in the mainstream. It's a dilemma that affects many Hollywood comedies set in the Great Depression, even those, like MY MAN GODFREY (1936) for example, that were made at the time.

Still, PRIDE manages by and large to transcend such difficulties. It is a life-enhancing piece of cinema, which could and should reach a wide audience.",8.0,2 September 2014

Brilliant moving and accurate I know I was there.,"I have just watched this film and on a personal level it affected me greatly. I was a young gay man in 1984 and I and friends, travelled to both the 84 and 85 Pride marches in London. I remember the Miners support at the 85 and we were greatly touched at the time. The movie got the details exactly right, I and many of my gay friends were on lots of marches including the ones against Clause 28 the evil Tory piece of legislation that outlawed promotion of homosexuality in schools and publicly funded museums and art gallerias (among others).

What I want to say about this film is that young gay and straight people should see it. It is immensely moving and funny. Just the right balance. I wept throughout and laughed because it brought to life my youth as I lived it in protest against that evil woman and her kind who dared to tell us how to live our lives, and who we couldn't legally love. It was scary times, AIDS, homophobia and arrest for protest.

I probably can't be objective because of my involvement as a youth in gay protest, it brought raw emotions to recall how angry we young people were then. But more importantly for me it reminded me like it was only yesterday of the immense Pride we felt at fighting for our rights and anyone who was a victim of hatred and prejudice.

All of the actors were a delight, and the portrayal of working class solidarity spot on and very emotional. I loved the fact that it had that British humour that is so peculiar to this country. The details were very true to the time, I recognised the clothes, the music and how tatty gay clubs were with peeling paint on the walls. It is a film that brings to life a time that has not been portrayed before, of protest, solidarity and how together we can change things.

I'm glad that such a film can be made and successful in this country now as a mainstream film as well. Maybe that shows that the protest of our youth changed things. I can get married now if I wish and thanks to a Tory PM, who'd have thought it? So one big thank you to all involved for making this 50 something gay man remember so vividly, and in spite of the dark days portrayed, our youthful struggle and reminding us that we really did something wonderful and change things, as this film is proof positive that we did just by the fact that is got made.

I hope that young gay people, who still cope with the same problems we did, isolated, alone, and scared can watch this film and gain strength from it and join the fight against prejudice still to be won.",10.0,11 February 2015
There is nothing not wonderful about this movie.,"If you don't laugh, don't shed a tear, or don't want to get up and cheer at the end, then you weren't paying attention during this movie. Based on a true story, this is a film about how two unlikely groups came together in the troubling times of the early 80s in the U.K., but in addition to that, there are a lot of side stories that occur at the same time. Excellent character development (especially after the first 20 minutes), which is critical for a based-on-true-life film. The acting is superb. Listen carefully for the deadpan humor the British are known for: especially if you're not used to London and Welsh accents. Highly recommend this movie to anyone who needs a lift and a reminder that *people are good.*",10.0,1 October 2014
Solidarity forever!,"In the summer of 2014, my wife and I went to a north London dinner party where one of the other guests was Mike Jackson, a leading member of Lesbians and Guys Support the Miners ((LGSM), a support group during the bitter industrial dispute of 1984-85 which provided money and assistance to a mining community in South Wales. He told us how he had been acting as a principal adviser to writer Stephen Beresford and director Matthew Warchus who had crafted the forthcoming film ""Pride"" which explored this unlikely pairing of groups fighting the iniquities of Thatcher's Britain and he made clear his delight at how the subject had been treated for the big screen.

So, the first weekend that the movie was on show, four of us from that dinner party were in the cinema to view it and we were all thrilled with how brilliantly this story has been told. Some of us even cried.

The film is unashamedly political, both in its representation of the prejudice against homosexuals at a time was AIDS was devastating the gay community and the hostility of ministers, media and police to the miners' fight to keep pits open, but the treatment ensures that this is an immensely entertaining and often very funny work. Although the movie wears its political heart on its sleeve, it avoids an over-simplistic portrayal of the gay cause by showing entrenched opposition to their involvement in the miners dispute from sections of the Welsh community and challenge from gays themselves as to why they should be involved in a workers' strike, although the controversy of the lack of a ballot authorising the strike itself is avoided.

The script is a triumph with every line making an impact and telling us something and there are some wonderful jokes. A disco dancing scene and a solo-to-group singing session are destined to become favourite recollections of a memorable movie. The cast is magical: a combination of distinguished character actors like Imelda Staunton, Dominic West and Bill Nighy (although his South Wales accent is wobbly) and young newcomers like Ben Schnetzer, Joseph Gilgun and George MacKay. And there is remarkable attention to period detail (we had the same design of coffee cup as in an early scene), enhanced by music from the time.

Although GLSM was eventually shunned by the official strike committee and the miners lost the strike and almost all of Britain's pits have subsequently closed, the concluding scenes of the film and the final bits of informative text turn this historic interaction into a success that should inspire the present day gay community and labour movement alike. As Mike Jackson put it in an article about the film: ""The one thing the ruling class don't want is solidarity; they don't want us to join the dots up.""",,13 September 2014
An absolute must-see,"Just been to the avant-premiere in Paris: The movie is absolutely magical. Not to oversell it, but it's a must-see. It's funny but very moving, with a perfect blend of ""comedy"" and seriousness (because these were dark times, both for the miners and the gay community). The dialogues are really good, well though-out, and delivered convincingly by a stellar cast, who are always believable in their roles.

It's not just ""good for an indie gay movie"" - it's an incredibly powerful movie that ranks right up with the best of them this year (and with stars such as Bill Nighy and Imelda Satunton, and a probably fair budget, it doesn't have an ""amateur"" / ""indie"" feel at all either).

Anyway, worth the price of admission (unlike, unfortunately, so many movies these days...)",10.0,3 September 2014
A must-see true story that nobody has heard about,"This is the best movie of 2014 in my humble opinion. The true story is one that everyone should know about. Now is the time for this amazing story to be told. The ending blew me away. I didn't see it coming, and I don't think anyone else will either. I love that this movie treats straights in a respectful and realistic way, and many of them are even heroic. Just like in real life - and it is a real story. Imelda Staunton and Bill Nighy are perfection in their roles. The entire cast is perfect. Since it is a true story, at the end of the movie they were able to tell us what happened to some of the people after the miners' strike. Several of the real stories of what happened to them later in life blew me away and made me cry - both for joy and for sadness. This really is a story that you need to know. Thank God this story has finally been told. The audience actually cheered at the end in my theater.",10.0,11 October 2014
"Incredible effort, but oh does it hit so hard","I saw this yesterday at a preview and was particularly impressed by the amazing production values shown in this film, as well as the powerful warmth of the ensemble cast within this. Many stand out, to the point where everyone stands out. My personal favourite performances are probably Dominic West's because of his wonderful energy, fantastic delivery and that the fact that he was playing a gay men (and was significantly less creepy than his Fred West performance) and Jessica Gunning's who played her play with such warmth and fire. That said, Staunton, Nighty and Schnetzer et all had some determination as well, it really is that not to want to give individual props to all.

British humour tends to be our best selling point and this film lays bare just how raw and witty we can be in our dialogue when handling such powerful drama. That said, the film is a very difficult viewing experience, in my eyes. The Miners Strike alone is a very raw and sad event for all to see, especially when there will be absolutely no surprises as to the outcome. On top of this there is a plethora of tragic LGBT issues that further hit the viewer like a fist throughout, be it a family not accepting their gay son, the Miners' refusal to fully support the LBGT community when the going gets tougher (the bleakness of those scenes are particularly devastating), the start of AIDS and the knowledge that these men's lives will never be the same, the occasional violence shown to the gay men the list really does go on. The fact that there is a strong undercurrent of humour throughout is particularly needed and welcomed, although towards the end it proves hard to laugh at. Many look back to the 80s with total joy, but for many people, they were uncertain, intensely painful years to survive in. This movie is a tribute to them, and the cast and crew provide their joie de vivre with an open, pulsating heart.

Watch this preparing to feel a wide variety of emotions. Not all settling.",7.0,10 September 2014
An amazing story that brings two very different worlds together for a great cause.,"Some films when they are in pre-release have so much hype and advertising running behind them that by the time the film is actually released we have seen three or four different trailers that have usually given away all the bets bits of the film leaving a sour and disappointing taste in our mouths and a feeling as though we have just wasted our time once we get around to actually seeing them. Then there are some films that deserve the hype and publicity that only ever get minimal, usually these films belong to a film festival and it's only through word of mouth that they make it to their intended audience. Pride is a film that was first released at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival winning a standing ovation and the Queer Palm award from there it went onto a limited release schedule mostly being involved in Queer Film Festivals around the world. Pride is a true life story based around the British Miner's Strike in 1984, Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister and not very popular, not with miners and especially not with the gay and lesbian community either. Joe, a young naïve closeted gay boy arrives in London to take part in his first gay pride march, soon after arriving Joe is taken in by a local gay and lesbian rights activist group who do their part to raise funds to fight their foe Thatcher and her evil ways. Soon after the group realise that both the Miner's and the gay community have a lot in common they make the decision to start raising funds for the families of the miners in a little Welsh town called Onllwyn. The miners reject the gay and lesbian activists money believing it will do more harm than good for their cause so the group unfazed but a little perplexed decide to take the money personally to the town to hand it over and explain their situation and hopefully form a new alliance against the countries Prime Minister and her party Pride is set in a very bleak and dark time of British history but I feel that it's never actually shown that way, sure things are dark and gray but I wish the director just added more hardship to his final edit for the film, not being a part of it personally but remembering how harsh it was from school study and other films I have seen over time. I don't think the film was shown as brutally honest as it should have been, from what I know of those days; they were horrid, times were rough and extremely hard, I just wish that it was portrayed a little more than what we were given. That is my only concern with the film, which says a lot I feel. None-the-less it is a fantastic well made, well directed and full of amazing actors that really bring the story to life, the story is really well scripted and the actors chosen in their respective roles have done an amazing job. Staring Bill Nighy (Love Actually, Shaun of the Dead) as Cliff, Imelda Staunton (Maleficent, Vera Drake) as Hefina Headon, Dominic West (John Carter, The Awakening) as Jonathan Blake, Paddy Considine (Hot Fuzz, The World's End) as Dai Donovan, George MacKay (How I live Now, Peter Pan) as Joe ""Bromley"" Cooper who is one of the few fictional characters created for the film and a whole heap of others, it is actually a very great cast everyone did their part to make the film work. As I said earlier the cinematography of the film was good I just wish it was darker like the times it is set in. The director and his crew have done a great job with this film written by Stephen Beresford and directed by Matthew Warchus (Simpatico). Pride is a feel good film with a fantastic story that can be shared with all your loved ones, there are a couple of scenes that may be a deemed a little over the top but perhaps you can use that to answer some curious minds if questions are asked. Pride is an amazing story that brings two very different worlds together for one great cause.",8.0,14 February 2015
Daring and yet not daring at the same time.,"In one big way, ""Pride"" isn't exactly a daring film. In the 21st century, doing a movie about homosexuals is very politically correct and very acceptable. Yet, on the other hand, this sort of film, despite the political correctness, is probably NOT destined to be a huge blockbuster--especially since many folks might not say anything against a pro-gay film but they certainly won't pay to go see one. In no way is any of this meant as criticism--just my feelings about the marketability of such a film.

In fact, I did enjoy the movie quite a bit. It's a true story (with a few deliberate changes---such as removing any references to one of the founders being a communist) about an odd alliance in the 1980s-- how a group of gay men and women came to ally themselves with British coal strikers! The thinking by some is that we are BOTH often mistreated by the police--so let's support each other. Naturally the film has a lot to say about understanding and humanity. Plus, the movie has a nice, gentle tone which I enjoyed.

Overall, it's not everybody's cup of tea but if you're willing to give it a try, you'll most likely enjoy this flick.",7.0,17 January 2015
A film to make you proud of British cinema,,9.0,8 September 2014
"Solidarity, tolerance and willpower","'Pride' is a movie about solidarity, tolerance and willpower. It tells the story about how two completely different groups of people learn to understand, help and appreciate each other. This is a positive message, and 'Pride' clearly is a feel-good movie.

The film shows how a small group of gays and lesbians from London decide to organize a fund raising campaign for the miners who are on strike against the pit closures ordered by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. They feel the miners are, just like the gay community, victims of police violence and right-wing politics. But they have trouble donating the money: many mining communities don't want to be involved with gay activists. In the end, a small mining community in South Wales accepts the money without realizing where it really comes from. Nevertheless, the Londoners are invited to the mining village, and a mutual bond grows slowly between the two groups. The movie ends with large groups of straight miners joining the Gay Pride march, to thank the gay community for their support.

The confrontation between the two different groups struck me as an example of clever script writing. It offers a range of dramatic effects: the initial distrust being replaced by mutual respect, the comical consequences of the confrontation, the feeling of solidarity created by the fight for a common goal. But at the end of the film, I was surprised to see that the story is in fact based on historical facts. Everything you see, has more or less really happened.

The film is made in the tradition of excellent British political feel-good dramas like 'The Full Monty', 'Brassed Off' and 'Made in Dagenham'. The balance between the serious political message and the light hearted way the story is told is well kept. Although sometimes you get the impression the homophobia would in reality have been a bit stronger in a rural Welsh community in the eighties. And near the end, you get the feeling some of the scenes are emphasizing the positive message a bit too much.

The eighties clothing, hairdos and music are well done and a joy to watch. The title of the film is excellent: Gay Pride meets workers' pride. Overall, this is an enjoyable film about an interesting scrap of British history.",7.0,15 November 2014

Just Plain Gorgeous,"I watched this entire film from start to finish with tears in my eyes and a smile plastered across my face.

It tells a beautiful story of a small group of Gay Rights activists who take action to support the striking miners whom they feel are feeling the same oppression that they had once and were currently feeling.

It is a gorgeous story of humanity. The film, in my opinion, perfectly captures the homophobia, bigotry, ignorance and curiosity that the LGBT community deals with showing the spectrum of opinions using the right amount of humour. While I can't speak to the accuracy of the time, I can see my own experiences with LGBT friends of mine and curious people painted across the screen.

This is a must see movie that will show how hate can harm and will also reinforce your faith in humanity.

The actors' performances were all amazing and flawless, from tears to dance sequences.",9.0,9 September 2014
Working class pride,"British stage director Matthew Warchus' first venture in filmmaking Pride--based on a true story that had slipped through the cracks of history--won the Queer Palm at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. And rightly so! The film opened quietly in New York at the 23 Street Chelsea Cinema.

Say the word pride, for many it brings to mind ""Gay Pride."" For others, it recalls Proverbs 16: ""pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall.""

But Pride is a film about virtuous pride—class pride, gay pride and gender pride. Overall, it is a feel-good picture of solidarity and union of interests that seemingly don't speak to our condition when money and the free market have the upper hand, as well as a sharp rebuke to ""identity politics."" For Americans with an interest in labor history, it should call to mind between attacks against trade unions by an aggressive government, a hostile press and very forceful police. Actually, today the attacks continue against public unions, minorities and sexual and gender minorities. What make Pride of interest now is its politically charged message that sharply contrasts with the attempt to increase the state of suffering and want of the poor and the declining middle classes, in the same way Ken Burns seven-part documentary The Roosevelts: An Intimate History finds the relationship Americans have with their government seriously wanting. When Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in 1979, she turned a prayer to her own advantage: ""where there is discord, may we bring peace, where there is error, may we bring truth and where there is despair, may we bring hope."" She brought discord and despair when she threatened to close coal pits, which would rob thousands of their livelihood and leaves even thousands more in want and poverty. The National Union of Miners launch a yearlong strike in 1983 that they lost, thereby initiating the decline of the once powerful trade unions. You know your not going to watch a ""gay"" film when the opening scenes are of miners on a picket line, with Pete Seeger singing ""Solidarity Forever,"" rarely sung in America today. Thus the theme of solidarity and union is struck from the very start of Pride—""there can be no power greater anywhere beneath the sun, yet what force on earth is weaker that the feeble strength of one, but the union makes us strong."" And what union surprises us than straight miners and gay activists? And that is at the heart of this unearthed fragment of history. A natural-born activist Mark Ashton (Ben Schnetzer) rallies a small group of gays to raise funds for the striking miners as Lesbians and Gays Support Miners. Not only is he homosexual he also comes from Ulster and knows something about sectarian and sexual oppression. He immediately grasps, from a class and gender standpoint, Thatcher's hard-nosed policies to close the mines as a way to support the miners subsisting on handouts to oppose government repression. And thus begins LGSM's fund raising to help the miners. The money and the food they collect, they bring to a small Welsh town, not sure how they will be received when the first meet the miners. Since they are from anti-union London, there is an immediate sense of mistrust, compounded by homophobia. Yet they find at first support in miners' wives—especially Hefina (Imelda Staunton), Siân (Jessica Gunning); they are loyal to their husbands, just as much as they are determined to support the strike and just as important, they are of strong will and mind. In a way, these vigorous housewives walk in the way of the Daughters of Mother Jones who participated in labor actions, or the wives of striking New Mexico zinc workers in the suppressed film Salt of the Earth. There is a point in the film when the press got word of support of striking miners. The printed media had at first a field day with headlines saying Perverts and Miners, undoubtedly publicity the parent union NUM wanted to avoid. But Ashton took ownership of this headline by organizing an energetic fund raising campaign under the banner of Perverts and the Pit that brought in even more money and support. Although the strike failed, the support LGSM did not go unrewarded. In 1985 a large contingent of straight miners led the Gay Pride Parade in London with band and unfurled banners of one hand grasping another in solidarity and union of purpose. Furthermore, as a sign of this identity of common endeavor, were it not for the NUM the timorous Labour Party wouldn't have come out for Gay Rights in the party platform The Welsh are known for singing, so it is not surprising at the community hall to hear a swelling chorus of voices intoning Bread and Roses, a song associated with the 1912 Massachusetts textile strike. Nor is it astonishing to hear the voice of Paul Robeson, who became a working class hero of the NUM's through his singing and 1940 film Proud Valley. Characters in Pride are neither, soapy, sappy or maudlin; they are finely drawn and played by first-rate actors, including Bill Nighy, Dominic West and Andrew Scott. Pride is an intelligent picture. It carries the forceful message that gays don't necessarily stand up for gay people, straights for straights, workers for workers, but acting in concert they can act towards political change for the better. As the trade union saying goes: a single finger has the force of one, but four fingers joined by the thumb makes a fist and there is power and determination, strength and power. Pride is highly recommended and not to be missed..",8.0,11 November 2014
Brilliant,"This is the best film I've seen in years. I would like to respond to Maverick14, who stated as a matter of fact that the lgsm had an ulterior motive. People can have a number of motives for any action, but the fact is these young people raised thousands for the miners, and in so doing broke down barriers , made great friendships , and put themselves in some very scary situations. Maverick14, what have you done for the community that puts you on such a pedestal of judgement ? Young Mark Ashton who led the lgsm, tragically died within a couple of years of the events portrayed in the film. I'm a very heterosexual male , but I can't begin to tell you how much I admire Mark. Maverick14, you may be gay, as you claim, but that doesn't stop you being very narrow minded , and indeed small minded, for denigrating what those brave young people did.",10.0,1 October 2014
Magnificent!,"A wonderful movie that made me think and laugh. It also made me cry and I am a heterosexual 50-something male who never shows public emotion! Bill Nighy; Imelda Staunton; and Paddy Considine are fantastic. But the message of solidarity and fighting against adversity for change are the stars of the show.

Based on a true story, the film depicts a group of LGBT activists who raised money to help families affected by the UK miners' strike in 1984, at the outset of what would become the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners campaign.The National Union of Mineworkers was reluctant to accept the group's support due to the union's public relations' worries about being openly associated with a gay group, so the activists instead decided to take their donations directly to a small mining village in Wales — resulting in an alliance between the two communities. The alliance was unlike any seen before but was successful.",9.0,7 September 2014
Fantastic,"It really is a shame that this film didn't get more of a campaign behind it. Someone here mentioned weeks ago how it could've easily been a big awards contender had it had some sort of campaign, and that's absolutely true. It's a pretty accessible, pretty feel-good film that absolutely rides on how well the audience takes to it, and while this is usually not at all the kind of film that I take to very much, I thought it was one of the most pleasant surprises of the year, and one of the most entertaining. It's pretty incredibly written on all fronts, with a large but impressive ensemble. The film manages to really find a great balance between how many characters' stories to show and just how much to show of them, being able to give enough of an insight into an impressively amount of characters as to have a great emotional impact. Truly fantastic film, deserved a lot more recognition.",,23 December 2014
Thankfully more than a rah-rah feel-good movie,"It would have been really easy for Pride to have been a preachy, feel-good movie with a caveman message of ""Gay rights good! Bigots bad!"" (not necessarily wrong, but it would have made for a pointless and overall bland movie). Thankfully, save for a couple of scenes straight from the inspirational movie handbook, it avoids these clichés and instead focuses on the characters involved in this unusual alliance between gay rights activists and a small-town of unionized miners and the strength of its spectacular cast (especially Imelda Staunton and Bill Nighy) that carry both the characters and the movie. Watching the gay rights activists struggle for acceptance and the small mining town being forced to reconsider what they believe in are equally as interesting and again helped by the amazing cast which are able to deliver both humorous and dramatic moments, although the movie underplayed the dramatic moments by not going into detail which, in my opinion, hurt the effectiveness of those scenes. Then again, maybe I am just a masochist. Overall the movie is able to avoid many of the pitfalls movies similar to it have fallen victim to and be pretty compelling as well.",7.0,21 July 2015
"Truly uplifting, great fun and a moving story","The film, so appropriately named, delivers a moving story about Pride, friendship and solidarity. When I wasn't laughing at the incredible performances from the top cast, I was crying at the emotional and moving story that runs through the film.

This so easily could have slipped into a tragic or an over politically charged story, but instead and to its benefit is so beautifully written and balanced. The clear messages come through hand-in-hand with side splitting humour all in the right places and never over done.

Simply wonderful and a credit to the British Film Industry and all the fine home-grown talent on display.

Overrated and uninvolving,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""Pride"" (2014) is overrated movie in my opinion. If this supposed to be a comedy than kill me know if i would ever have to watch a comedy like this again. Sure, it's a true story (of which i haven't heard before), but for me it wasn't interesting at all. And that's strange, because this picture has very good actors, with some of them playing very good here. It has realistic approach, and script is realistic, but for me this movie dragged - a lot. I wasn't really engaged in a story, and i couldn't really care how will it end. It has some nice moments, but at running time 1h 52 min. this movie in my opinion is poorly paced.

Overall, for me this picture is a disappointment. It had all elements to be good and even great, but it failed to capture my attention in a story, and if movie fails to caught your interest than it's a big problem. I didn't really cared about the characters nor the outcome, and although the ending was kinda nice the overall experience is poor.",6.0,15 February 2015
Best movie of 2014!,"OK, being gay and from that time, perhaps that does color my impressions, but it was still an amazingly great movie! Wish it had done more in the big-time awards, but the BAFTA isn't small beerish. Imelda Staunton may be the biggest name, and as always, she never disappoints. People may say it glosses over and does ""feel good"" but having your parents toss you out into the street, or having explosives thrown into one's store/office isn't really feel good. Nor is that snide, self-righteous television clip of Thatcher saying she can't change her style. Nary a bad performance or heavy-handed move therein. Beautifully photographed. Some of those lads, oh, you just want to take them home (and I mean that in a nice way!) The women of the town - love them, especially Sian!

"Brilliant but, sadly so true to the events portrayed","I lived a few miles from the community shown in the film. It was a hard winter and we had nothing but respect for the people of the area, especially the women who kept up spirits and organised food and clothes for their families. They were a very proud group so to accept handouts took a huge amount of courage. I remember giving as best I could and the furore caused by the established press over the funds from London. This film probably goes as close as it is possible to capture the events of the LGSM & the South Wales miners' communities. Congratulations to the makers for telling a worthwhile story so well; and thank you for remembering the spirit of Paul Robeson. While, in many people's opinion, Thatcher destroyed the mining communities people like those portrayed in 'Pride' built self-esteem, supported those in need, change attitudes and politics. Knowing the events and the people shown, I can honestly say nothing in this film is exaggerated. Brilliant, utterly brilliant.",10.0,21 September 2014

And if you fumed at the injustice of it all in Made in Dagenham, and cheered the women workers on as they made their hard-fought bid for fair play, then you'll love this film.

It's an amazing bit of political and social history brought alive on the screen, and great entertainment to boot.

I lived in South Wales during the miners' strike, and the characters in Pride were really well portrayed. They weren't twee, or stereotypes. They were wholly believable.

Absolutely loved it.",9.0,11 September 2014

"""You must have found it a bit weird""","A pretty wholesome movie set in very tumultuous time. This had heart, soul and works as a reminder that sometimes what's needed is an odd couple partnering. When a gaggle of gays and lesbians come together with a pit full of miners in Wales you know it's for a worthy cause. This handles some very serious topics but overall the spirit of the film is a bright one.",7.0,24 July 2022

Decent...,"Watched this as my step daughter is doing a paper on the film.

It's pretty decent but I think a 7.8 score is definitely too high.

It's a good (and true) story about a crazy time, if you remember anything about that time then you really should see this.

My only gripe is the fact that certain films get scored so highly because of the subject matter. It seems nowadays any true story film that deals with a difficult time or a tragedy etc, automatically scores high. Schindler's list is an exception that is almost a perfect film. But an example for me is Dunkirk, it's an average film, but because of the amazing thing that happened in real life, people think it deserves a higher score. I'd rather show my support for those amazing people by wearing my poppy and donating money as often as I do.

So I think this film falls under that umbrella, it's better than average (I class 5 as average) and worth watching if you were involved or remember the strike, but nearly 8/10 it is not.

To clarify, I'm not $#!tting on gay people or the struggle they and the miners had to go through during this period, this is solely based on the film, nothing more.",6.0,23 December 2021
"A heart-warming, funny awesomely acted film","Judging by the applause that broke out several times during the course of the movie, PRIDE touches on some themes near and dear to the LGBT community. However, this is NOT a film strictly for that crowd; rather, it is a laugh-out-loud, touching story with a message that crosses all political, social and ""politically correct"" communities that probably could only happen in a non-American country, since we are so polarized at this point. I thought Bill Nighy would steal the show, but that was done by Dominic West, who definitely knows how to dance. The lead actor, Ben Schnetzer, was mesmerizing; along with the rest of the cast, although at times certain lines were missed due to the quick line said with a British accent. There was also a beautiful song sung a Capella by an amazing singer and scenery that made me want to book my flight to Wales immediately. I noticed at the opening credits, the ""BBC"" rolled by, so I knew this would be a first-class movie, and it was. Beautifully acted by all, only one or two ""saw it coming a mile away"" moments, gorgeous scenery, funny lines and a message that reminds me, ""If it's morally right, then it's the right thing to do.""",9.0,1 October 2014
A very good movie !,,7.0,11 May 2015
My Sash windows never worked like that,I was born in 1961 so the 80's were for me that magic age of between 20 - 30. I lived in Oxford UK so fairly active Gay and lefty political scene. This movie is false and I hope my now 20 something kids are not subjected to this drab stereotypical drivel. I spent a fair amount of time in Wales back then and can say with much conviction that Gays as portrayed in this movie would have been frowned upon to say the least. Some of the campaigners for the miners round Oxford were utter dicks and many who did not support the cause where OK people with valid opinions .... not skinheads or homophobic. Pride paints a bubblegum picture of the time and I am sure the true story of these events bore little resemblance. For sure no one's sash windows actually worked like they do in one of the ending scenes. Pity I would have thought reading the reviews that I would have liked it,1.0,31 December 2014
PRIDE swelled my heart and made me PROUD to be British,"This movie has jumped straight to the top of my best films, sitting firmly alongside Brassed Off & The Full Monty. Imelda Staunton & Bill Nighy appear (beside many other wonderful actors) in the profoundly important and hilariously re-told story of the joining together in solidarity of two groups less similar as you can image – the striking miners and the Lesbian & Gay communities. It is full of humour and tension but ultimately so heart-warming the tears were streaming down my face. I loved it when the little old Welsh lady asked to be shown all of London's gay nightlife including ""the rubber scene"". It restores my faith in humanity and traditional British fairness and good nature. I had wondered how we turned around the institutionalised homophobia which saw Britain's LGBT people crushed under the Sexual Offences Act of 1967 to the legal enshrinement of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act of 2013 – in only a few short decades? Now I know how this journey started.",10.0,7 September 2014
A film about gay people that's not about gay people,"It's not about gay people or miners but about two groups of people from very different backgrounds discovering that they are not that different after all, and connecting on an incredibly human level. Every little subplot is beautifully handled, almost every character adds something to the story and is given their due, not one of them is there just for the sake of adding another face. Especially Mark's character moved me, though. He is the face and the force of his group, and he combines the main values that this film is about: solidarity, loyalty, and fighting with everything you have for what you believe in. The film just keeps getting better and better and when you think it couldn't possibly get any better, the ending tops it all - and it actually happened in real life! And the cherry on top: its so incredibly FUNNY!! I don't normally watch a lot of comedies because I often think they tend to be a bit silly, but in this one had me reconsider my opinion on the genre. The comedic parts and the dramatic parts are well balanced, and it manages to convincingly tell a story about a serious subject while maintaining a light tone. Side note: my father, 60 years old, a tad conservative (he has no connection to or interest in the gay community whatsoever) watched it on my recommendation, and he really enjoyed it. So: please give it a try, it will be two hours well spent!",10.0,22 April 2020

Irresistible,"When the aim of a film's plot is to portray a relatively unknown storyline through reasonably unknown actors working under a production company that barely managed a wide-release, you're building yourself a huge mountain to climb, even if the picture does manage an investment in their audience members. Fortunately, Pride is a movie that goes above and beyond its required pay grade in every way imaginable, leaving it a rising star that's getting more and more popular by the second (as opposed to the other way around – always a good sign).

The story centres on a group of gay activists who meet regularly to go on marches and collect money in support of gay rights. From there, we're pretty quickly launched into the idea of the miner's strike and how the problems they're facing now are similar to the problem the gays have been facing all their lives, and how they should team up to rebel against the Thatcher regime. That's pretty much it in terms of plot, but this is a history feature retelling a story that's so high up on the feel-good scale, you'll forget its flaws in a heartbeat. Such flaws do exist unfortunately, with the main one being the characters. Not that they're not interesting enough, but that there's too many of them, and the film tries to focus on this wide abundance as opposed to giving us deep insight into a select few. As a result we see limited character development and often don't have enough insight into their backstories to care as deeply as we want to be allowed to. There is also no clear central character driving the story forwards, with the one given the most screen time proving the weakest of the bunch.

With all of that said, as promised, you don't really notice (or care about) such drawbacks because you're having such a great time. The tone of the film kicks in right from the opening raucous song and you can't help but be dragged into the battle and root for victory anyway. If there isn't a strong lead protagonist to drive the film, then the wonderful soundtrack does a fine job, with the flawless acting from familiar and unknown faces alike forcing you to invest in the subversion. Irresistible.",8.0,29 September 2014
Completely blown away,"This film tells the seemingly unlikely friendship between a group of gays and lesbians from London, and a group of Welsh miners on strike. The Londoners vocalise and mobilise their support for the striking miners, and together they write history.

I saw Imelda Staunton promoting the film ""Pride"" in the pride march in London last year. Months later I finally got to watch it. And I was completely blown away by how good it is. I am deeply touched by Mark's passion to stands up against injustice; I'm touched by Hefina's open hearted tolerance, embracing unexpected friends. I'm touched by Bromley's fight to stand up for himself. I'm touched by the town's fight against intolerance. I'm touched by the solidarity and unity displayed by the people. I'm touched by the epic ending, which was beyond my expectations.

I liken Mark's act to start helping the miners as a random act of kindness, which snowballs into something monumental. Random acts of kindness is satisfying, and it pays!",,11 February 2015
Saves its goods for the final stretch but its a pleasant time til then.,"An underdog in this years awards season, Globe comedy picture nominee Pride perhaps earns too much of its merit on behalf of its subversive premise. Cinema doesn't usually offer an array of bold characters like this. It's just a shame that Pride doesn't do anything with them. That's more or less what the first 75 minutes relies on as we watch a gay pride community support the striking miners of a small Welsh village. With the bloated ensemble, we never get under the skin of its animated set of characters and it feels like a long setup - that is until the payoff. For its final 45 minutes, when they are so close to achieving their communal goal, few of the film's familiar faces finally come face to face with personal obstacles, dilemmas and struggles rather than shared ones, standouts being Ben Schnetzer, Bill Nighy and Andrew Scott.

Why can't the rest of the film have the same kind of texture? Nevertheless, the film is saved by this extended final stretch. Maybe it could have benefited with shredding a handful of its characters but then it would've removed the sense if community the film has. While the bright colour of the film, both in production design and camera movement, gives it an endearing sprightly tone, this heightened atmosphere is a double edged sword where it rarely feels authentic. There's a couple of moments where it does something special, but it's swiftly knocked off balance with something typical. Its hard to argue with Pride's thesis - it's not just about workers rights or gay rights, agendas or not, it's about human rights. The film is still a pleasant and humorous experience which touches some tender moments in its third act - and they're earned by that point.

7/10",7.0,1 January 2015
Pride is a hilarious British film with lots of British humor and great cast,"This is not a fiction or product of some creative mind, it's all the nearest history of the Great Britain. During the British Miner's strike in 1984, a group of lesbian and gay activists decided to raise some money to help families of those affected by the strike. Having decided so, they contacted to The National Union of Mineworkers - the organizers of almost two year strike - and suggested their full support. However, the Union declined it due to the union's worries about being openly associated with a gay group. So the activists decided to directly take their donations to Onllwyn - a small mining village in Wales. This is considered to be the birth of organization Lesbians and Gays Support Miners (LGSM) that finally managed to help affected citizens recover from this long running problem.

This is the 80s, when homophobia in Britain is still real and well supported. But the movie opens and ends with two gay prides, where the first one coincides with closeted young boy's birthday, he's name is Joe (George MacKay) and it's his first ever march. This is where he meets Mark (Ben Schnetzer) and his friends, who genuinely believe that they can do some good for miners in Wales. Uniting in a group of several people, they decide to meet Dai (Paddy Considine), who unofficially represents the workers. This is where the story of solidarity, community and inner fears starts.

Pride genuinely feels so good, it's funny, delightful with lots of heart in it. It got everything one could ask from a good comedy: British humor, honesty and a lot laughs. The primary reason why this film works is its amazing cast of many unfamiliar and some familiar faces, like Andrew Scott, who plays a boyfriend of Dominic West's character Jonathan. But they all are brilliant as a whole. Stephen Beresford's screenplay is very smart, witty, focusing on many things, including AIDS panic, characters personal life and social issues, that definitely can make a lot people think. While it may sound a bit dramatic, Pride does not suffer from the lack of funny moments and by funny I mean hilarious to tears. Each scene which includes the old ladies from Onllwyn can make anyone cry with laughter, because the way they deal with first encounter with ""actual"" gay and lesbian people is just devastatingly joyful.

Beresford manages to demonstrate the difference between generations by making old local folks meet the young Londoners and the way they discover each other is so entertaining that you never feel the length of almost two hours. It has number of quotable lines, that are very natural and exemplary comic (my favorite - ""Where are my Lesbians""). Director Matthew Warchus, on the other hand, managed to turn a very good screenplay and great cast into most adorable movie this year.

Film has some uniquely memorable moments. For instance, Jonathan's first dance in Wales, which made him super popular even among mine workers, who despised LGSM members before. Or the ladies visiting gay clubs, fetish clubs for the first time or them finding dildo and porn journals in Gethin's room. And if you think that this is not funny on paper, then you should definitely see Pride. The art of this film is that it makes small moments exceptionally haunting.

As I said before, the cast works perfectly as a whole. There are no single outstandingly good performances, that can be memorable for a long time, but everyone doing their job is what makes a good cast.

Considering all above said, Golden Globe nomination for Best Comedy/Musical did not come as a surprise for me. Pride can absolutely be deserving nominee for Original Screenplay at Oscars and I won't whimper if it takes some other film's node in this category.",8.0,8 January 2015

It is also a reminder that hope can be found. In rekindling old relationships, and starting new ones In friendships and love. This film does it subtly but what it screams is unity in its best form.

Enjoyable story of Solidarity and gay rights.,"This is the telling of a forgotten part of the story that took place during the Miners Strike of 1984 – 85. Thatcher was out to crush the miners and the National Union of Mineworkers; she encouraged the 'me' generation and painted caring and unions as somehow dirty and evil. I did as much as I could to support the miners and went on more demos than I can remember as well as giving half my wages to the cause – every week, plus what ever else I could raise.

This is about the Lesbian and Gay Support the Miners group and is told in an often comedic fashion. There is a plethora of talent on show here from Imelda Staunton to the great Bill Nighy. It is extremely well made and has a fairly good eye to the period detail. The plot centres around the reticence of some in the South Wales mining community to accept money from what some labelled as 'perverts'. The locations are great and I recognised most parts of London including my fave café 'The Regency' and the Town and Country Club doubling up as The Electric Ballroom.

Most of the issues are dealt wit here but often without any real analysis but it is done essentially as a comedy and for that you really do not want the mood to get too dour. I really enjoyed it and even the soundtrack was great – except for Phil Collins who was a supporter of Thatcher – so weird including him. He famously said he would leave the country if Labour won the election. After they lost and the Tories got back in, the New Musical Express had a headline that said 'Bugger off Phil Collins Anyway'. But the film does end with Billy Bragg in fine form singing 'There is power in a Union', so they do pull it back – no pun intended.

This is one of those films that manages to be all things to most people and as such I think it is a fitting testament to those of us who did stand together and proved that winning or losing being united is in itself a victory, and as such this film should be applauded.",9.0,3 May 2015

The cast are absolutely superb, and the story is an intriguing look at solidarity in the least likely of places - it was hard in this modern day to believe it is a true story, as nobody sticks their neck out for complete strangers like this any more.

The movie also boasts a fantastic soundtrack and some good clean humour. Another British cinema triumph. Be you gay, straight, Welsh, a miner or none of the above, this movie is well worth watching.",9.0,20 January 2015

"An inspiring story, even if it sometimes doesn't feel right as a film","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

In 1984, the gay rights movement is in full swing, and Mark Ashton (Ben Schnetzer) is a young homosexual who believes the answer is to join forces with another group of people fighting for their rights a bit further from home, in the shape of the striking miners. His plan is to send money from their struggle, to help them in theirs, but Mark hasn't contested the homophobic attitudes held by many miners that would see them throw his money back in his face. But he is persistent, and gradually they come to form an alliance together, while closet gay Joe (George Mackay) battles with his own demons.

Very few battles, in the real world, are ever won on their own, by one great, powerful, almighty force. Hell, the only reason I'm not writing this review in German at the moment is because England was helped to win the war by America and Russia. A struggle to overcome terrifying odds is one thing, and battle is an important word when considering this dilemma, but one word is even more important and realistic when put into context: solidarity. That is the thing that ultimately secures victory, hopefully for the right people, in the real world, when people from different backgrounds are united together in one common cause. Pride, if nothing else, deserves some recognition for being one of the few films I know of that highlights this important truth, without trying to make one person or group of people the top dogs.

Set at the beginning of the 1980s, when social attitudes were challenged and changing like no other, to the left and the right, it highlights an important turning point in modern culture, and brings an inspiring and engaging story to the screen. That said, sometimes the tone of the film and the style of the content feels more suited to the stage than the screen. It feels like something adapted from a musical, especially during some of the 'dancing' sequences, although it doesn't seem it actually was. Director Matthew Warchus doesn't always keep the narrative flow going in the smoothest or most coherent of directions, and so despite having an interesting sub-plot and numerous subplots on offer, sadly it sometimes loses its way.

That said, a mostly young cast do a fine job of keeping the aspidistra flying, with support from older hands such as Bill Nighy and Imelda Staunton on hand to keep everything in perspective. Despite not being perfect, its still inspiring, interesting, and mostly fun to watch. ***",7.0,18 October 2015

The movie is very emotional and you can't help but feeling angry for the way this group is treated for just trying to help someone.,"""These mining communities are being bullied just like we are."" During the summer of 1984 the National Union of Mineworkers in the U.K. went on strike. When they began to get attacked there was only one group who stood up for them and tried to help. The group was known as LGSM - Lesbians and Gays Support Miners. This group put everything they had into defending the miners but the miners were not all that excited about these being the activists that helped. On the other side other gay rights groups were upset at the group because the AIDS crises was just beginning and they felt the LGSM should focus on that rather than the miners. Refusing to give in the LGSM put everything they could into defending the rights of the Minors and everyone slowly began to find out more about themselves. This is a very good movie that is all the more powerful since this is a true story. You really become involved in everyone's lives and you experience the highs and lows with them. The highs being very high and the lows being very low. The movie is very emotional and you can't help but feeling angry for the way this group is treated for just trying to help someone.

Pride-ictable.,"A mawkish cut 'n' shut of two leftist cause celebres, populated by stereotypical characters, moving inexorably, yet insufficiently quickly towards its predictable conclusion.

Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to stop at one sentence. There are some lame jokes about what happens when working class folk- salt of the earth in the main- encounter gays and lesbians for the first time (so far as they know). There is all the personal and political anguish you would expect of the early 'eighties, thematically explored with total unoriginality. The writing is lazy, boring and irritating in its preachiness. This is a ninety minute political broadcast which has unleashed some sickening mutual backslapping amongst a swathe of the arty left who were young in Thatcher's Britain. The film's great achievement for me was to alienate someone who was and is broadly sympathetic of the miners, and who is hugely sympathetic to gay equality.",2.0,30 September 2014

Inevitably-one-sided but persuasive telling of a quite amazing true story,,8.0,2 May 2017
Pride and Prejudice (Circa 1984),"This film is recommended.

The Brits have perfected the bittersweet working-class comedy. From 1959's I'm All Right, Jack and Life is Sweet to more contemporary fare like The Full Monty, Made in Dagenham, Kinky Boots, and Billy Elliot, this genre has become the chief import from England of late. Pride is the latest inspirational crowd-pleaser, a feel-good movie in the best sense,. While the film overtly tugs at the heart, it also keeps its course in trying to tell its story of solidarity between two oppressed minority groups in an honest and refreshing style.

The story takes place in 1984, during the Reign of Thatcher and the beginnings of the AIDS crisis. Based on a true story, with many fictional characters thrown in for dramatic tension, Pride centers on two opposing groups: the National Union of Miners and a group of gay activists who support their cause.

￼The plot focuses on a young closeted gay man named Joe who meets up with a militant group of homosexuals who side with the mineworkers in their struggle for equality. Forming the LGSM (Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners), they begin to raise money to help the striking miners while dealing with the prejudice surrounding them, both from the straight community and from the miners themselves.

It is their initial meeting and slow acceptance, amid the homophobia and bigotry, that makes Pride highly watchable. That compelling premise and the skillful ensemble of actors that fill in some gaps in the characters and story-lines make the film touching and emotionally centered.

￼Solidly crafted by stage director Matthew Warchus. the film has many memorable moments but adheres more closely to the political aspects of the plot rather than delving into the more personal stories of the protesters. The screenplay by Stephen Beresford is literate and moving, although there are some missed opportunities at expanding some of the individual character's dilemmas. More scenes involving the family dynamics of both the miners and the gay activists' lives could have given the film even more impact. That said, it is more a sin of omission than inclusion.

￼Still, the cast is perfection. British film legends like Imelda Staunton, Bill Nighy, Paddy Considine, and Dominic West mingle with new engaging talents like George MacKay, Ben Schnetzer, Andrew Scott, Monica Dolan, Jessica Gunning, and Joe Gilgun. The acting by young and old alike is quite nuanced, filled with pathos in one scene while being boldly comic moments later. Warchus paces these scenes most effectively.

￼All in all, Pride does indeed have much of which to be proud. GRADE: B

"Joyous film of two tribes, one pink, one coal-black, at war with one enemy: The Iron Lady.","It took a while to make it to a screening of Pride, but last night I finally spent two hours in the company of pits, perverts, miners and the finest ensemble this side of the summer, and it warmed an autumnal evening perfectly.

With only his second film (after Simpatico) behind the camera, Mathew Warchus has delivered a warm, wonderful crowd pleaser that is packed with a fine British cast, fabulously atmospheric production design, a foot-bouncing soundtrack and hair and make-up that transport us back to the 80s with fondness and longing.

In 1984, Great Britain was a nation of two sides, blue and red, left and right, privileged and put upon, us and them. In the north on one side of the political battle stood the miners, striking against the impending coal pit closures; on the other side a bulldozing Conservative government headed by the defiant Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher. Meanwhile in the south, gay and lesbian rights were being fought over just as vehemently and London was alive and vibrant with the flamboyant colour of the community's pink triangles and rainbow flags while the angry and unenlightened bared their teeth and drew blood in unprovoked attacks. And all the while lurked a dark enemy that was doing the thugs' dirty work for them: AIDS.

Joe (Sunshine on Leith's George MacKay), apprehensive, illegal, and still hiding in the closet, arrives in London for his first Gay Pride march and finds himself in the company of Mike (Joseph Gilgun) and Mark (Ben Schnetzer), an activist in search of a new cause. Seeing the oppression the miners are suffering as remarkably similar to their own, Mark leads his band of merry campaigners on a fundraising campaign under the banner of LGSM: Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners. The initial collection is a success but there's just one small problem: The miners don't want the help of a bunch of (insert your chosen expletive here) sexual deviants.

Warchus has perhaps shot the politics of Pride through a rose-tinted lens at times and a there are couple of rare, self-conscious moments of forced emotion, but these are very slight matters in a funny, tender, thought-provoking, emotion-stabbing, eye moistening joy.

Stephen Beresford's script bounces along merrily, sprinkled with humour and dripping with one-liners more seasoned screenwriters would kill for. It may be his first screenplay but please don't let it be his last. He masterfully weaves the humour around the potholes of gloom and bitterness, ensuring the darkness of the time is neither bypassed nor wallowed in. Throughout Pride we are reminded of the issues that divided the country, the communities and the families that comprised them. At every turn Beresford places another spike of prejudice, another betrayal, another parent that cannot deal with the truth, but history proves that justice will win and that light will erode and eventually eradicate the darkness. It is a challenging journey to watch at times but Beresford keeps mawkishness at bay and fills his story with joy.

Gifts like Beresford's screenplay make an actor's job so much easier and the ensemble gives his screenplay the best possible treatment. The stalwarts of Bill Nighy and Imelda Staunton bring familiarity and comfort to Pride, although that in no way diminishes their impact. This is a more muted performance than we are used to from Nighy as Cliff, the quiet, thoughtful council member while Staunton lets rip with her naughtiness, shrieks and whoops, particularly in a scene that will have you heading to the disco sharpish.

There is flamboyance and bluster in spades from Schnetzer (in stark contrast to his turn in this month's The Riot Club) and Dominic West but it is tempered perfectly by the reticence of Andrew Scott's Gethin and MacKay's Joe. Each character has been written with understanding and we are given a taste of all that made up the struggle of the era from the sparkling drag queens of Soho to the grizzled men who fought on the coalface and there is nary a hint of pastiche nor lazy stereotype amongst them.

Even the character of Wales is delicately reflected segueing from the cold, hard, stoic and depressed village of Onllwyn to the awe-inspiring majesty of the sweeping hills and valleys. Pride has clearly been taken in every aspect of this wonderful gem of a film.

It would have been easy to make the infamous Pits and Perverts benefit gig the culmination of Pride. It would have made for a high note on which to end in celebratory mood, but Warchus takes us further and the final note is higher still, prompting the threat of damp cheeks for the second time.

Joyous. That is all.

You must excuse me; I need a tissue and I have an awful lot of Jimmy Somerville to listen to now.

Phony and manipulative,"Recently I saw and reviewed a beautiful, gentle movie titled Last Summer, by Mark Thiedeman. I wrote that although it's obviously a fantasy (teenage boy lovers have the full and loving support of everybody in their small Arkansas town, including their church) it feels completely true. It feels real and genuine. My head said, ""this is a fantasy"", but my heart said, ""this is true - every shot, every word, every gesture is true and real.""

This movie is the opposite. Although it claims to be a true story, it feels as phony as an afternoon TV soap opera. My head said, ""this is a true story""; my heart said, ""no way.""

It's extremely predictable, extremely melodramatic and extremely manipulative. It pulls every possible emotional string, too often and too hard. The good guys are totally good, the bad guys are totally bad, and there's nothing real, nothing three-dimensional or the least bit subtle anywhere.

Nobody despises Margaret Thatcher and her soul-mate Ronald Reagan any more than I do. Their brutal destruction of labor unions - and their smug, arrogant contempt for anybody who wasn't rich and straight and white like themselves - can never be forgiven. If this movie WAS based on a true story, the real people involved have my unqualified respect. This movie does them a disservice by making their heroism seem like cheap melodrama.

The Welsh landscape, language and people are marvelous, and Imelda Staunton gets better with every movie she makes. They make this movie well worth four stars, but that's all.",,26 December 2014
Lays it on a little too thick but nevertheless a poignant and heartwarming story,"A brilliant cast deliver an often heartbreaking depiction of this unlikely alliance. The ease in which certain individuals cast aside their lifelong prejudices is a little fanciful and overall, the movie tends towards corniness. But there is enough string acting and great comedic writing to make Pride a memorable and moving experience.",7.0,14 March 2021
This is one of my absolute favorites,"This movie - I cannot say enough good thing about it . It's uplifting, it's funny , great music , powerful writing, an incredible piece of history . I have cried every time I watch it .

This is one I can watch over and over again and suggest to anyone who asks me what to watch . Obviously there are some liberties with the story but the overall themes of self discovery and fighting for what's right and community are really really well portrayed and inspired you to do better and be better . Watch it - it's absolutely worth the time and extremely enjoyable .",10.0,25 July 2022
A great piece of LGBT history,"In 1984, a group of gay and lesbian London activists raises funds to give financial support to striking miners in Wales . At the beginning, there are serious tensions between these two very disparate groups until they realize they have common enemies: the government of Margaret Thatcher and slanderous right-wing tabloids. This film is based on a true story.

""Pride"" does a fine job in its portrayal of the struggles of the gay/lesbian movements in many countries in the 1980s: while there was progress, it was at a great price due to the massively collective homophobia of the time. This interesting recent history might have been better portrayed if the film had been longer than its two hours. There are many interesting characters and we only get to see glimpses of them. More time might have allowed the viewer to know more of the characters.

Some characterizations did work well though. One is a gay Welshman who left rural Wales to escape homophobia. Actor Andrew Scott makes much of his brief scenes by conveying deep emotion in his face. Another interesting story is of a young, closeted gay man who has recently moved to London . His journey into adulthood is finely told.

The directing by Matthew Warchus is competent but conventional. More flair and style might have had more impact. There are also times it's difficult (at least to those of us English-speakers outside England and Wales) to understand the accents and colloquial terms. This is unfortunate as many in-jokes are missed.

The film can be praised for its relatively balanced gender casting - a rarity in many movies. The number of female characters is not grossly outnumbered by the number of males. Also, as the women are relatively ordinary folks, they are portrayed by regular-looking actresses who do not look like supermodels, contradicting a trend not just in Hollywood films but in independent and international films as well, including French cinema

""Pride"" is a fine film worth seeing especially for its hopeful and moving finale. I was pleased but not surprised to read that a musical stage version of this film is already in the works. Bring it on! - dbamateurcritic",7.0,22 April 2019
Very Special Film.....imho,,9.0,12 January 2015
"Amusing, real and well acted, but I didn't feel the full significance of the actions","The UK's 2014 film Pride tells the real story of a solitary year in the 80's when a group of pride activists came together in solidarity with mineworkers.

It is 1984, Margaret Thatcher is the loathed Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Gay activists have just participated in the Gay Pride March which garnered minimal response from the public, whose attention and police force were focused on the National Union of Mineworkers strike.

The story of Pride follows a small group of primarily twenty-something activists, led by Mark Ashton (Ben Schnetzer), who decide to campaign for donations and help the families of striking mineworkers of Onllwyn. Based on a true story, the audience follows the effort through the eyes of closeted Joe Gilgun (George McKay) as the newly minted Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners group (LGSM) come together to assist the miners, despite reluctance and bigotry.

Pride is an unabashedly political film that manages to convey the nuances of the prejudices and gay movement of 1984 succinctly without simplification. It manages to inhabit all the genres it attempts: historical, comedy and drama. Each character has importance as a different perspective and emotion regarding the efforts and atmosphere. The acting is passionate, youthful, powerful but real.

Pride could be described first and foremost a historical drama and secondly a comedy. The characters, especially Dominic West's Jonathan and Imelda Staunton's Hefina, are amusingly lively and vibrant but there are no obvious hokey jokes. The 80s setting, music and clothes also add a sense of amusement. But honestly if you don't at least chuckle at lines like ""Where are my lesbians?"" delivered by an 80 year old then you have no soul.

For some reason Pride did not resonate with me. It felt flat and and it was difficult to feel a connection because the focus was fragmented. Perhaps I am not able to comprehend the completely situation in the UK at the time, or the magnitude of the historical significance of this effort.

I liked that director Matthew Warchus and writer Stephen Beresford did not embellish the plot, but in the end it felt too ""documentary"" for me for this film. Pride is presented too openly, allowing for interpretation of significance by the audience. Perhaps my American brain is too used to dramatic effect signalling moments of importance to me that I missed it.

Really really lame!,"As of this writing, this movie has an 8.1 rating, and My Beautiful Laundrette has a 6.9. This is firmly in the unfunny, obvious, nauseating category of ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" type films which should only be tolerated as an in-flight movie, on one's way to have a hamburger in Rome. Why such appallingly lame movies are lauded as must see is beyond me, especially when films 30 years old are fresher, more vibrant, and not at all hackneyed. Be warned, a movie without nudity, violence, and swearing does not recommend itself based on these merits, despite what most of the reviews of it are saying between the lines.",1.0,23 December 2014
Possibly my favourite movie ever!,"I've seen it at least ten times and every time I watch it I laugh and cry like the very first time.

It's the British cinema at its best. The range of stars in it is worthy of several amazing movies, but here you have them all together. Probably the topic itself held the movie from becoming another Love actually or so.

The movie is based on the true events and comparing the story line to the wiki articles on the subject(s), you can see it was very loyal to the historic account. But it hits the human side of the historic events. Two marginalised communities of the time get together. How very different agendas find an overlap. At very perilous times for both.

It's almost impossible to find a favourite scene, the best actor/-ress. There is no segment where you turn to do something else or want to pause the movie, to the very final credits. This is the movie that I go back to watch whenever I get tired of the current box office titles that I won't remember a week later, and I'll never get tired of it.",10.0,8 January 2023
Fabulous!,"I was invited to a screening of this and went expecting to be informed and intellectually stimulated, which I was. But I didn't expect the movie to be so unbelievably entertaining. It starts with the music of Pete Seeger and ends with Billy Bragg, two activist musicians who I greatly admire, but along the way a key scene dances its heart out to Shirley and Company (you'll probably have to look that up).

I suppose I should have anticipated that since the UK Miner's strike of 1984 had already generated one great movie, Billy Elliot (with its own great dance sequence to T Rex), the magic was there to be tapped again. Perhaps it's that Maggie Thatcher makes such a great evil queen villain. But as Shirley sings, ""One monkey don't stop no show""

So I urge you to see this and have yourself a grand old time.

This week I've seen three movies that might be classified as message movies, First ""Love is Strange"" which was all very moving and sentimental but which had so many script problems that at a certain point it was really a chore to ignore them. Then "" La Grande Illusion"" at MoMA which is certainly well scripted and constructed but ultimately, for me, not very emotionally moving. This movie was so fast and fun and furious that if there were any problems I've long ago forgotten them. And, without a doubt, the message came through strong and clear and fabulous.

I suppose I should warn you that if you get steamed up when you can't understand every word of an 'across the pond' accent, maybe you should wait for a DVD with subtitles.

Also: If you think of Rupert Murdoch is a great Australian er.....Brit.... er .. American... then this movie is not for you. If you think that ""Wild Strawberries"" provides a template upon which all movies should be based then this movie is not for you. If, however, you thought that ""Kinky Boots"" was not quite RED! enough (there's a double entendre there) then buy a ticket to this and have a ball!",9.0,5 September 2014
Some of the most colorful characters you'll see on film,"""When you're in a battle against an enemy so much bigger, so much stronger than you, well, to find out you had a friend you never knew existed, well, that's the best feeling in the world.""

Pride is Matthew Warchus's third feature film and the first one since his 2004 musical, Our House. Pride isn't a musical, but it surely feels like one with all the colorful characters and the lovable 80's soundtrack. It was a surprisingly fun film with an upbeat message about solidarity. It is one of those rare crowd-pleasers that stands out from other films thanks to its strong cast and uplifting message. I never imagined a film focusing on the historic events that took place in the UK in 1984 when the miners were at strike and found an uncommon ally in the gay and lesbian activists could be so fun. We've had similar plots in the past where two groups come together in the aid of each other despite their differences, but I don't think it has been done in such a contagiously joyful manner. Take last year's Dallas Buyers Club for example where we get a contrasting alliance between a redneck cowboy and a group of gays suffering from AIDS. That was a much more serious film where we got some comedic moments due to the contrasting lifestyles, but Pride takes this similar premise of contrasting groups coming together and delivers a much more hilarious and uplifting film. It still delivers the message and despite being formulaic it manages to stand out thanks to its colorful characters that never lose their humanity. I can't think of another film where a group of gay and lesbian activists aren't just fighting for their own cause, but are actually invested in helping others who are going through a difficult moment. So it stands out in that it isn't one of those films that is focused entirely on delivering a message in favor of gay rights, but rather focusing on the solidarity between these two groups. That is what makes this a much more humane story and one everyone an identify with. The way the film is portrayed feels like a musical at times and you actually want to dance along with some of the characters when the music plays. Pride is a film with a lot of heart that reminds us that despite our personal issues there are always others out there in need of our solidarity. Pride might feel a bit too sentimental at times, but it is a feel-good film nonetheless with some of the funniest scenes of any comedy released in 2014. There are also some dramatic moments where I literally got goose bumps because I was moved. It is well balanced and uplifting despite its flaws.

Some of my favorite moments in the film involved the clashing of these two contrasting groups. Despite their differences they learn to understand each other because they both have suffered from oppression. The cast couldn't have been better. Ben Schnetzer gives an impressive performance as the gay activist who comes up with the idea of supporting this group and winning a new ally in the process, but the fun really kicks in when they interact with these miners from a small Welch community. This is where we are introduced to some great characters played by Paddy Considine, Jessica Gunning, Imelda Staunton, and Bill Nighy who are outstanding. Nighy really delivers by underplaying his character and proves that sometimes less is more. I enjoyed Gunning's strong female performance and I look forward to seeing her in more films in the future. George MacKay also delivers as this young kid who hasn't told his parents he's come out (which is probably the most formulaic part of this film) so he lies to them about his activities. Andrew Scott and Dominic West also have some endearing moments on screen together. The best thing about Pride is without a doubt the strong cast which thanks to the rich screenplay by Stephen Beresford are given such colorful and interesting characters. It is a film that reminds us about our humanity and the importance of being solidary towards one another. It is both cheerful and earnest about its subject matter.",8.0,14 January 2015
Pride is about a rarely examined part of the history of the Gay and Lesbian movement,"First I'd say everything you saw in the trailer for Pride is there, no one does heartwarming feel good movies in the midst of bleakness like the Brits do... but there is something completely different about this Pride: it's the Birth of Gay Pride Movement in the most inhospitable of environments.. a repressive Thatcher Regime, a burgeoning queer identity that has so much internalized Homophobia that they can hardly keep a committee going much less advancing a cause, and a shifting economic system that rewards self- centredness as opposed to communal well being.

This after is a true story

What this movie chronicles is the evolution of a few people who armed within nothing more than sheer will and the support of the suppressed to start a movement that will change the world by communing around their shared suffering to galvanize a nation.

There are many themes that run through this movie, but the characters themselves are the ones that get the best treatment. It helps to have amazing actors playing roles that seem to have been written for them, and a soundtrack that will get you moving and shaking, but mostly it's the strength of the writing to capture a time in history where Unions mattered and they could change the world.

This movie, like Harvey Milk, needs to be part of the curriculum of any queer history exam.",8.0,22 October 2014

What a fabulous and joyous movie!,"I don't know where my head was back in 1985 to have completely missed this story, but I'm so glad I've now seen the movie and that finally, thanks to these people, the world has changed for the better.

I still can't believe so many were/are stupid enough to not realise people who are gay don't 'choose' to be, it's who they are. They can't and shouldn't deny their true selves or be expected to live a lie.

This film was uplifting, showed the ignorance of people who didn't know any better, and one thing for sure is that I'll definitely be joining my nearest Pride march/event when it comes around.",10.0,30 June 2022
"Enjoyable film, but it's all just a bit too nice","This is one of those films where its hard to pin down exactly what's wrong. The acting is first rate, the dialog is realistic and amusing, and costumes, props and sets appear pretty much spot on. I think its that it is all just a bit too sanitised and everyone is just a little bit too nice. Most of London was a filthy, miserable place in the early 80s (see High Hopes by Mike Leigh), the majority of people where somewhat lacking in money, and it really wasn't until after the riots in 1985 that the overall tackiness started to fade. - in contrast, everyone here appears to be fairly well-off and all turned out in their Sunday best whenever we see them and all of London looks quite nice. Even more noticeable, every working mens club in 1984 had to be viewed through a thick fug of tobacco smoke and however well they were looked after, furniture and furnishings were apt to be tinted brown from tar, somewhat tired and all rather second-hand. Finally, even though this is a light-hearted look back, I did feel the bigotry and discrimination was side-stepped and over-sanitised, things did start to progress in this period, but not really that much..",7.0,25 August 2018
A must see film!,"Just been to a preview screening of 'Pride' and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Had not heard about it before and didn't know what to expect, but an absolute blinder of a British film. Heck it had me in the first minute with a banner saying 'Thatcher Out' accompanied by my favourite tune The Smiths 'What Difference Does it Make'. An incredible funny film with heart that had me clapping with laughter and then tears rolling down my cheeks.

I was not aware of the support that the Lesbian and Gay community had offered to the miners during the strikes in the 80's - a real eye opener. An excellent narrative with a very strong ensemble cast including Bill Nighy, Imelda Staunton and Dominic West. Please please go see and support British film. Anyone who was around in the 1980's will feel transported back in time through the excellent attention to details - the hair, the clothes and the classic music.",10.0,7 September 2014
A friend in need is a friend indeed & here it goes mutually.,"Tone, Script & Story: The story is how Lesbians and Gay activist support strike of miners. It further highlights how in return they get support from miners, to gain acceptance for their rights.

If you belong to a certain community and a movie is made highlighting them you automatically get attracted towards it. This is where it was indifferent to me. However if you are curious you would get entertained by certain aspects that are filmed or made known.

Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Justified. Music: Good. I liked 'Bread and Roses' with its melody (fan of such music). Acting: Justified.

Final Verdict: Extend your hand for help; you won't be disappointed in the long run. A friend in need is a friend indeed and that goes mutually.",7.0,25 August 2018
Proud,"Everybody who was involved in this film should be proud of Pride.

Gives a slice of what was occurring in the 80's.

Top performances throughout and brilliantly directed .

All manner of accents and ideas with pseudo-clichés come together to form a beautifully told tale of how the bullied come together en- masse to conquer small minded bigotry.

Every now and then the film slips into negative mode to show us the deflation of battle but then stands up to be counted.

Then i had tears running down my cheeks, and then smiles, tears, then anger at the political scene of those days... its a film that does push all the emotion buttons but is not contrived at all. It does cleverly sum up the different attitudes to gay and lesbians and the striking miners of that time via the well drawn characters.

So a massive thumbs up for a great tale based on truth and told with skill.",9.0,25 September 2014
Fantastic feel good film with a serious message,"I have to say right off that I absolutely loved this - 2 hours flew by. It is really difficult to deliver a feel good film that does not shy away from serious issues without descending into mawkishness or sentimentality - but this film really does. It does not avoid the shadow of aids or the genuine issues gay and lesbian people faced in the 1980's, but it is not all dark - I was laughing out loud during much of the film. Being a bit of a lefty as I am probably helps, but I see this as a political but mainstream film that anyone would enjoy. So uplifting to see how totally disparate groups can support each other and learn more about both communities in the process (even how to dance!) Give it a go even if you think the subject matter won't be to your taste - it might surprise you!",10.0,7 September 2014
Four gays and a lesbian,"It's 1984 and the Prime Minister whom Bill Nighy is pleased to call ""Margaret ****ing Thatcher"" has pitched phalanxes of policemen against the miners in their long-drawn-out strike against the latest wave of pit closures (the movie manages to avoid mentioning that many mines had already closed under previous Labour governments). A small band of London gays - and one lesbian - start fund-raising to support the miners and then descend on a small village in Wales, which accords them a mixed welcome: all but one woman are quick to accept them; all but two of the men are hostile.

Prominent among the gays are earnest Joe (George MacKay), a 20-year-old from Bromley not yet out to his family (the age of consent was still 21 in 1984) and flamboyant Jonathan (Dominic West in a role very similar to Simon Callow's in FOUR WEDDINGS) who breaks the ice by introducing the village people (excuse pun) to disco dancing. In what I suspect is a highly fictionalised episode, a group of the villagers come up to London and are treated to an eyebrow-raising tour of gay hot spots.

This 'culture-clash' comedy is scripted in the vein of TV's MIRANDA or ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS. The ensemble cast perform with relish, especially. Paddy Considine and Imelda Staunton as two of the more gay-friendly villagers. Homophobia and Aids cast darker shadows to remind us that the 1980s was not only the decade of Thatcher versus the unions.

Very much in the spirit of KINKY BOOTS and MADE IN DAGENHAM, PRIDE takes a fragment of modern UK history and builds it into a sparky, spiky comedy. Another crowd-pleasing demonstration of British cinema at its very best. I hope the same team will look back at the Sottish referendum in a few years time!",8.0,25 September 2014
Touching true story! 6/10,"Review: I quite enjoyed this touching true story about a group of gay and lesbian activists who come together to raise money for the families of miners during the miners strike in London, when Margaret Thatcher was in power. As the movie was based around the 80's, there was a lot of prejudice against the gay and lesbian community but this movie shows how this group came together and fought against all odds, to raise the money for the Welsh people who were going through such a difficult time. The group also protested for Gay and Lesbian rights, at a time when Aids was the biggest fear for there community, so this movie is a big eye opener to a world which is the norm in today's day to day life. The storyline is great, along with the performances and the witty script which brought some light to a situation were a lot of people were struggling to come to terms with there sexuality. The real footage on the DVD was touching because a lot of the activists were actually in the movie and they get to tell there story of how it was to deal with the true situation. Anyway, it's a well made movie which tells a true story which hasn't been told before so it's definitely worth a watch. Enjoyable!

Round-Up: I've always been a fan of Bill Nighy's unique style of acting so I was glad to see him in this film, even though his role wasn't that big. The same goes for Dominic West who also had a small but important role in the film. Most of the rest of the cast have only had small roles in films so I can't really comment on there performances. Paddy Considine has starred in a few movies like the Bourne Ultimatum, Cinderella Man and Hot Fuzz but he's never played the main role. In this movie he played the go between the activists and the miners quite well but it was Dominic West's dancing which really impressed me. The other thing that impressed me was how a small group of people, who had weekly meetings, could have made such a big impact for there community. The amount of people that joined them in the end was touching and I'm glad that they changed a few laws after putting in such a big effort. 

Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $14.7million

I recommend this movie to people who are into their powerful dramas about a group of gay and lesbian activists who come together to support the miners strike at a time when there sexuality wasn't that welcomed by many people. 6/10",6.0,2 May 2015
Brilliant!,"I watched Pride last night at the Brock University Film Series in Niagara, Ontario. One of my favourites this year. I first heard about it last week at the Golden Globes as it was nominated for Best Comedy or Musical. That's pretty much all I knew about it.

I was a teen in northern England during the mid 80s and it brought back so many memories: The green sofa in Joe's house was exactly like ours. The song Love and Pride by King - a song I haven't heard in yonks - was one of my favourites. In fact a day later I'm still singing it in my head. Stork SB margarine. Bronski Beat. The hair ""styles"".

My favourite scenes: Bill Nighy's and Imelda Staunton's characters making margarine sandwiches for the miners, when BN reveals he's gay and Imelda tells him she's known since 1968. Such a quiet beautiful scene. I don't think Bill quite pulled off the Welsh accent but he, along with all the other actors, did a stellar job. I can't think of anyone who did not.

The young actor playing Mark was simply phenomenal. I had no idea he is American as his Irish accent was soooo good. Kudos to him.

I was a little distracted by Dai's wife played by Liz White. All through the movie I kept trying to remember where I'd seen her before. So I had to IMDb her when I got home and it was in Life on Mars.

This movie comprised many rich layers. And also revealed once again that nothing is life is black and white, there are so many shades of grey in between. Gay rights have come a long way since then but still have a way to go. The comedy wasn't overdone; hit the perfect note. The angst wasn't too dark either. Very well balanced.",9.0,15 January 2015
I didn't understand this film...,,,17 May 2015
Pride,"I might get some hate for this review. But besides the cause, I don't get how this movie would get such positive reviews. It just seemed overly drawn out and super pretentious at times. The dialogues just seemed a bit too pretentious and over the top. Like they were constantly trying to up each other when it comes to how much more emotional things they can say to one another. It all just seemed overlong and boring. While also failing to grasp the heart and emotions of the viewers. Sure the movie is about a group fighting for a cause despite the ostracization and with just the belief in the cause being their main motivation. However when it comes down to it the filmmakers was trying extremely hard to make this a amazing movie, but it falters in that department. While also coming off generic and predictable. In my opinion I think most reviewers are giving this movie praise because of the cause over substance. I give this movie a 6 because of the effort that has been put into it.

The chemistry between the actors is magnificent and the tone is so upbeat and uplifting whilst also drawing attention to very serious topics at the time.

"A Little Bit Annoying, But Its Heart Is in the Right Place","""Pride"" is a movie about tolerance and understanding that has its heart in the right place. And it's hard to argue with its message, and no one but the most close minded and prejudiced would want to. But it's not a film for people who enjoy subtlety or nuance in their movies. It wears its heart on its sleeve, and easy as it is to watch, I also find myself rolling my eyes occasionally at its heavy handedness.

The rampant sentimentality is tempered somewhat by the wonderful actors Bill Nighy and Imelda Staunton in supporting roles, two pros who immediately elevate anything they're in by their mere presence. They're backed by a whole bunch of pleasing younger and lesser known actors who have a lot of chemistry as a cast and clearly are enjoying themselves.

""Pride"" is the kind of movie that tries so hard to bring its audience to its feet at the end that it ends up being like the kid at school who tries too hard to be liked. But like that kid, it's harmless enough and even fun to be around if you can get past some of its annoying qualities.

After all, are the problems of homosexuals only problem in the world, are they something special? Who cares, anyway?

An emotional and moving film based on true events,"I watched this film recently as part of a school film group, and I can't even describe the emotional response from just about everyone in the room. This film made me laugh, it made me cry, and I felt such a connection to all of the characters. Despite not having experienced 1984 or the miners strikes for myself, the film shows you the struggles the LGBT community faced (and continues to face) in regards to being accepted by the rest of the world, as well as the struggles the small towns in the UK faced throughout the mining strikes. It seems like an odd pairing, miners and LGBT people, but the film depicts the solidarity between the two groups perfectly, without sugar coating anything. This film has earned itself a place on my favourites list that's for sure!",10.0,1 August 2016
"Pride joyfully prides itself in being a feel good, if occasionally flat, comedic drama.","It's a rare occurrence to encounter a historic British LGBT film that manages to be entertaining and somewhat informative, with minimal fictionalisation. Much like the pride group itself, this drama is bolstered by a myriad of colourful characters against the dreary backdrop of the Miners' Strike, evoking both political and social contextual themes. A passionate rally consisting of homosexuals attempt to be heard by supporting a small mining town in Wales during the infamous Strike during Thatcher's government. Thus, the support group LGSM was formed. The film confidently illustrates the struggles of homosexuality, on both a personal and national perspective, within 1980's Britain. Segregation from heterosexuals due to the AIDS epidemic, homophobic violence and inaccurate publicity from the press. Yet, the light British comedy complements these heavier topics well in what ultimately is a fluffed up drama. Some additional focus on the hardship for the group and specific members, particularly Bromley coming out to his parents or Gethin visiting his mother after abandonment, would've enhanced the minimal amount of emotional attachment for these people. However, the consistently light tone gets the job done and depicts an important milestone in British LGBT history. The plethora of fresh and experienced talent amongst the cast highlights the raging talent within the country. From a feisty Nighy and Staunton to an innocent MacKay and Scott. The old and young, straight and gay, made for several humorous moments that will certainly put a smile on your face. It's narrative structure lacks cohesion, starting by following a new member as he rapidly joins the group which allows an outsider's perspective. This then instantly changes and shifts between each member's backstory as well as the residents of the Welsh town. It's overstuffed with too many characters. Pushing that aside, it's a wonderfully enjoyable drama that seamlessly blends history with general entertainment, powered by excellent performances.",7.0,24 August 2018
"Often intriguing, although curiously lacking, drama about leftist-unity in 80's Britain.","I could never understand what everybody was supposed to be so 'proud' of when it came to homosexual identity, or LGBT rights. Was it the rise of the presence of the AIDS virus? Surely not. That society generally became more promiscuous? The fact that Judeo-Christian values copped one in the eye? Probably. Whatever the reason for the pride, it isn't answered in ""Pride"" - a colourful leftist wet-dream which is probably too long and, while ambitious, doesn't impact in the way it perhaps might have done if it were more focused and carried with it more of a directorial stamp.

Homosexuality has, in essence, always been despised - irrespective of the era and irrespective of the civilisation. For centuries, it was outlawed around the world under religious dogma: Christianity; Islam; Hinduism... Then came the world's first atheist state in the form of the Soviet Union, whose women averaged four abortions in a lifetime but whose homosexuals were still criminalised. So much for socialist egalitarianism. In Cuba, run by the supposed poster-boy of the left at the time of this film's setting (the 1980's), Fidel Castro had homosexuals grossly maltreated.

In the modern age, the ghost of Alan Turing looms large over western civilisation's moral compass when it comes to such people: a man with a mathematical mind so brilliant, it would be dishonest to say that it didn't contribute to the British war effort against the Nazi machine to the same extent as Wallace and Montgomery. Despite being a hero, he remained a pariah simply for being gay.

All of this leads us to life in Britain in the penultimate decade of the last century, where ""Pride"" tells, firstly, the true story of young Mark Ashton (Ben Schnetzer) - an LGBT and Communist activist who took pity on the mining communities' treatment by the government - and the more synthetic narrative of a twenty year old rube named Joe (George MacKay), who lives at home in what looks like an affluent Conservative Party stronghold and is beginning to realise he's gay.

Primarily, ""Pride"" is interested in Ashton's trying to get together a makeshift relief-effort entitled LGSM (Lesbians & Gays Support the Miners) in order to help said miners as they struggle out of work. 'But why should anyone care about them?' asks somebody. ""Because miners dig for coal, which produces power, which allows gay people like you to dance to Bananarama till 3 o'clock in the morning."" Eventually, a community in South Wales hear of the group and Matthew Warchus' film moves to tell the story of the two parties coming together.

Where the film is at its strongest is during the earlier phases of the miners, initially led by Paddy Considine's Dai, and Ashton's LGBT troupe hooking up. Set at a time when the political dichotomy in Britain was not yet entirely broken, there are stark binaries between the two groups which make for intriguing viewing: the obvious physical disparity lies in the difference between the big, butch miners and Mark and his effeminate friends. The LGSM are more into their synth-pop, whereas the miners enjoy their slower, traditional guitar music. The miners are far from 'Conservative', but possess a small, close-knit community consisting of nuclear families whose children are suddenly being exposed to a brash homosexual subculture. It is still a tetchy issue.

Indeed, one friend of Mark's refuses to do a damn thing for the miners on account of having been bullied for being gay when he lived in a mining community up north. Ideologically, two of Mark's friends are, ultimately, entrepreneurs and therefore capitalists, where the miners are ardent socialists and vote Labour.

But was it not, after all, Antonio Gramsci who once wrote that the bloody, muddy experiences of World War One acted as the unifier of the despised classes so that they now all share the same goal of toppling capitalism/discrimination/injustice etc.?

Where the film struggles is in its lack of any real substantive plot. Its secondary strand, that of Joe's emerging homosexuality and his shame in having to keep it from his loving, though traditionalist, parents is underdeveloped where it might have really been the explosive core of the film. The second act lacks coherence, and essentially consists of either group traveling to visit one another. Certainly, by the time it has resorted to characters rolling around in fits of giggles clutching sex aides, it has somewhat lost us.

Irrespective, the film does well to capture what it felt like to be in Britain at the time with these various political factions co-existing. It is never cordially established, but I would guess many of those around Mark, being as metropolitan and from London as they are, would have found allegiance with the old Liberal Party more-so Labour when it was run by the likes of Foot and Benn. They are, therefore, more out of step with the miners than they perhaps realise. Warchus encompasses those from each of the three sides of the British political triangle of the time impressively: the struggling socialist communities living under Thatcherism; the Liberals who, whilst more capitalist than they'd care to think, utterly reject right-wing social attitudes and the Tories, with their housing estates characterised by detached properties; bourgeois gatherings; 'homophobia' and green and pleasant front lawns.

Mark Ashton was a real person, and according to the Internet, was a member of the British Communist Party back when the Cold War was still on and the Kremlin itself was responsible for funding much of its activism. Was he even aware of the USSR's position on queer people? The film does not say. What it does have to say, however, is that he was a brave individual who stood for what he believed in and copped a lot of flak for it. Whatever your position on anything in life, there is something to be drawn from that and his tale depicted here.",5.0,30 March 2018
They Should Be Proud,"This is a special piece of film making.

Highly recommended for fans of having a good time.

A story filled with beautiful characters who take a plunge in to unknown territory to make positive changes.

Interestingly for a story filled with pretty strong issues, the film stays overall, very light, fluffy and entertaining. Its masterfully done as it both entertains and educates.

The performances are first class, even the baddies are injected with emotions that can make you relate to them even if you don't agree with their stance.

Pride...in the name of Solidarity,"In the grand tradition of British under dog movies such as The Full Monty, Brassed Off and their fellow travelers, Pride adds another chapter to this wonderful genre. Set in the 1980's during a coal miners' strike, this movie examines the lives of those who were instrumental in this highly charged, emotional chapter of Margaret Thatcher's tenure. While the backdrop is, of course, the miner's strike, this movie is really about relationships and the bonds that can unite even the most disparate groups of individuals for a common cause. Everything about this movie, from the acting to the writing and the directing is first-rate. If you are homophobic or anti-union, this movie will probably cause you to throw up. In which case, I personally, would have little or no sympathy for you. For anyone with an open mind and even a little interest in the plight of the little man, watching this movie will be time well spent.",9.0,8 May 2021

The Pride is almost right!,"The British film ""Pride"" is based on the true story of U.K. gay activists' work to help miners during their lengthy strike of the National Union of Mineworkers in the summer of 1984. It was a story that I had not heard of before. Director Matthew Warchus' was sure to bring some inspirational elements of the film on how two opposite polar groups can work together for civil rights and fair labor. But Warchus' was sure to implore us with the aforementioned concept a few too times to many; as worthy as the concept is. I am a big fan of 80's New Wave Retro music, so I was very proud of ""Pride"" to include some U.K. New Wave classics. The ensemble acting was commendable but not sensational; which included Ben Schnetzner as U.K. gay activist leader Mark, Dominic West as the flamboyant Jonathan, and Imelda Stanton as a Miner Committee Member. ""Pride"" is not the biggest pride film piece from the 2014 movie year, but it has enough activist gravitas to give it a shout. *** Average",7.0,31 December 2015

The pit factor,"The 1984 Miner's strike caused deep scars in part of the country and there was media manipulation at its best. It is still a shame that both the ITV News and BBC News have not been challenged over their pro government propaganda. For example news footage where Police on horseback attacking protesting miners was edited to show the Miners were provoking the police who then attacked. This was not in the raw footage, the miners only threw things after the police attacked.

Thirty years on Britain has a rump of the mining industry. In terms of health and safety it has had its day when the government in the late 1990s had to pay vast amount in compensation to ex-miners for long term health consequences.

In what was a divisive strike not helped by the Miner's having a militant leader with little cunning. This film based on true events sees the gay and lesbian community from London raising funds for striking miners. As the Miner's union had their bank assets frozen, it was difficult for striking miners to survive. I remember our family giving tins of food as part of a food parcel and we even did not live near a mining community.

The juxtaposition of striking miners with gays & lesbians raises all kinds of issues as it was also an era where the Thatcher government were thinly disguised homophobic and I suspect the world of the mining community were probably not noted for their broad mindedness.

The film deals with the initial reluctance of the mining community to deal with this new found support which gradually lead to mutual acceptance. There are of course side plots of someone reluctant to come out, the flamboyant gay man teaching the villagers how to dance and one of the men from the capital is actually returning to his roots. The actors seem to be enjoying themselves and pitch the performance just right and there is good use of period setting and music to evoke that 1980s mood.

It is a low budget feel good drama which does sometimes fall into predictable schmaltz. The film touched upon the era of AIDS entering the news cycle. In the end the strike led to a bitter defeat for the miners but the union committed the Labour Party to fight for gay rights which it did when it came into power in 1997.",7.0,2 February 2016
Pride without Prejudice,"Based on actual events, this independent UK film chronicles how gay and lesbian activists in the 1980s agreed to raise money for miners during a lengthy strike upon seeing that the miners were being treated as poorly as them by authorities. The film as such offers an uplifting message and while the treatment here is perhaps too sentimental for its own good, there is something to be said for the film's depiction of the human spirit in action and ability of joined minorities to make a difference. At two hours long though, one's mileage is likely to vary depending upon how engaging one finds the characters to be. Imelda Staunton and Bill Nighy are both fine in pivotal supporting roles, but the main character is a closeted young man played by George MacKay who nervously sneaks into his first pride march, only to find himself soon at the centre of the activist group, and all of his innocent naivety plays out by the books. As others have commented, the film's humour-laden approach to the topic also takes some of the bite out of the drama; then again, there is room to argue whether the film was ever intended to be primarily about striking/activism. Having MacKay as the main character turns the film into more of a tale of an outsider finally finding acceptance for once in his life, and there is a fair bit to like in the film's tale of young individuals united by differences that would ordinarily result in ostracism in society.",5.0,12 March 2016
Very touching,"I laughed, I cried, and I was we'll informed.

The movie was very entertaining from beginning to end. Though very Disney like in it's formula, I feel that help the story be inspiring and spread a good message about everyone working together for causes, especially those that are not their own. That's what I like best. Us being different but supporting each other, cause are fight is similar. It's a lesson that we all need to understand.

Good cinematography and costume design and well as a great ensemble cast that allowed me to get personal with all the characters more so than I expected.

Definitely worth seeing.",8.0,3 October 2014
Beautiful on many levels and even though formulaic manages to arouse the senses.,"I expected great things from Pride but I was bowled over by the levels that it hit home. Pride is reminiscent of other great British Comedy dramas, and I say that without remorseful flinching. Often the tag of classic British Comedy is used to promote a movie irrespective of any true consideration, more a simple quality by association rather than affording an objective representation. I am pleased to say that Pride delivers and carves itself the right to associate itself with other great films such as Billy Elliot, Love Actually, Brassed Off, Four weddings and Notting Hill for example. For me its unavoidable feel to Brassed Off. The acting by all the major players is exceptional and ""hammed"" to perfection, at time pure pantomime, yet at others so tender and subtle that it assists at assimilating the theatrics into the very real life accounts of a truthful yet unlikely marriage of two very unlikely bed fellows. A Lesbian and Gay action group and a community of striking Miners and their families. The association however unlikely on superficial examination isn't quite as absurd as one would think, marginalised and hated by the common media in Thatcherite Britain The film negotiates the story beautifully and engages by a perfect balance of poignant reflection and humour. I grew up in Thatcherite Britain and applauded this as a more truer representation of the legacy of ""The Iron Lady"" than a recent sensitive Biopic. The film occasionally derails itself at dramatic grabs for belly laughs in true English Seaside postcard style, reminiscent of the Carry On legacy. On the whole though exceptionally well drafted and excellently crafted humanistic review of what it is to unite in a common cause against adversity. Ben Schnetzer, Paddy Considine, Andrew Scott and Dominic West were all standout and brilliant. Bill Nighy was Bill Nighy and the film as all of the films he has been in benefits from it. Jessica Gunning is a delight and rich seam of mined talent as is Faye Marsey. Imelda Staunton is as always exceptional although was a principal in some of the movies overt clumsy grabs for humour. I was prepared to Laugh, I cried at both poles of emotion and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Brilliant and a must see in my opinion !",9.0,3 November 2014
A wonderful film,"The LGBT community has been marginalized for a very long time, both in film and in history books. We are a people largely without a widely known history. Books about gay men in the Holocaust aren't housed in the library with other books about the Holocaust, but in the LGBT section. So, unless you use the catalog to find books about WW2, you'll never see them, and as it's not widely taught in schools, you'll never know about the pink triangle.

This lovely film shows the LGBT as a group that society maligns, and how desperation on the part of community finally allowed them into their lives and hearts. And of course getting to know what we think of as different removes the mystery and the fear factor, replacing discrimination with acceptance, hate with friendship and love.",10.0,28 November 2014
stand united,"""Pride"" is about the alliance of two dissimilar groups brought together by a common enemy. The UK's gay community, bullied by Margaret Thatcher,* aligned with the Welsh miners during the 1984-85 strike. In their daily lives, the urbane gays and hard-ass miners had little in common, but they both wanted the right to a livelihood.** While the strike eventually failed, the alliance proved the need for all subjugated groups to unite. Nonetheless, I can't picture the people in West Virginia aligning with the people in San Francisco's Castro District.

Anyway, a really good movie. I recommend it.

*Thatcher bears a lot of the responsibility for the situation in Iraq. In addition to her role in arming Saddam Hussein against Iran, she told George Bush not to get ""wobbly"" when he initially wanted to negotiate to get Iraq out of Kuwait.

**Considering what a destructive process coal mining is - to say nothing of burning the coal - how could people view coal mining as an actual livelihood?",10.0,4 January 2015
Engaging and likeable,"Interesting story told quite well. The message of these two groups banding together was heartwarming, and I think we need more stories about similarities between different groups, as nowadays there seems to be more division and arguing amongst people in general (be it online or in real life) than ever.

Overall, it made for a charming watch with a good balance of comedy and drama, and a large cast that's well balanced, with all of the main actors/actresses getting numerous opportunities to shine.

Problems I had with Pride are minor, but I wasn't a fan of the original score (the songs on the soundtrack not written for the film slapped though). I also thought the scene where everyone joined in singing in the bar was a little cheesy, but other than that it did a good job at not feeling too sappy or overly sentimental.",7.0,9 October 2021
Great comedy,"British movie makers know how to make good quality comedy. When American comedy so often recline pee, poo and fart humor British comedy relay on true life and bring comedy out of every days life. Pride is a great comedy of colliding of two different part of folk group. At the same time it is a vivid reminder of how sometimes it is good to step aside from your comfort zone and bravely get to know different group of people as they really are. Best thing what can come out is that both groups of people learn something new from each other. Pride makes it humor freshly and tells the diversity of London gay scene unconstrained. Sometimes you wish that the haters would have a little courage to confront difference and learn something new out of it. I won't give full five stars to this movie, because of it rugged story telling. It tries to tell too many stories and loose the best focus on that. Focusing on few people despite of many it could be bring the stories more close to you. As aggregate Pride is good start for a new year of new movies. You can always relay on quality of British comedy. Great movie which dares to adhere even the sore side of life.",8.0,3 January 2015

Go and see it,"This is a typical British film – warm, well-acted, well produced, funny, believable and a very good story - it is also based on true events! For those people too young to remember how bad the 80s really were, it highlights the struggles of two groups of people – one group's fight to be accepted in society and one groups fight to be allowed to work and put food on their tables. It also highlights how evil Thatcher really was - attempting to starve her own people back to work. It features a great cast, who execute their roles to perfection, and a great soundtrack. The story, while sympathetic to the plight of the two groups, just tells it how it was. The overall message running through the film is that we should never give up the fight. We should also never forget the struggles that both groups of people went through in a decade when greed, selfishness and intolerance were not only rife in society but actively encouraged by the establishment and the media. Not much has changed! Go and see it.",9.0,18 September 2014
Brilliant in every way,"This is, for me, one of the best films of the year. It has bucketloads of humour (it really is laugh out loud in places) along with fascinating social insights and yet it's all based in fact. OK, they added one entirely fictional character, but I understand that almost all of the individuals portrayed in the film really existed and the campaign that they mounted really happened.

If you're a fan of Margaret Thatcher, you might find some parts of this to be disagreeable because, not surprisingly, it takes a very unsympathetic view of her part in the miners' strike.

That said, it's well worth going to see if you still can.",8.0,2 December 2014
Simply magnificent!,"The point of writing a critic is to talk about the good and the bad of a movie. But while I could find an infinity of superlatives to describe this movie, I am struggling to come up with one single thing I disliked. Maybe it's just a flawless film.

The movie depicts the story of a group of Gay activists that make themselves call LGSM, and decide to help the struggling English miners in the eighties. In their quest to help, they will have to put up with the social stigmas of those times, and face a cold shoulder reception from the very people they are trying to help. However, their determination and enthusiasm will be enough to win anyone over. Except obviously the government that sent the miners back to work after a year of strikes.

The movie is just great from start to finish, so prepare yourself for tears and laughs in equal measure up to the very last minute. Especially, in the final stage which is just a reflection of what truly happened and couldn't be more uplifting if someone wrote it.

8.5/10,"Delightful, inspiring, entertaining and moving. Pride isn't only one of the best of the year, it is the best ""feel-good"" movie I have seen in quite some time. I am counting to have this in my final top 10 of the year. I loved this movie.

The very solid and confident direction sustains an amazing script that combined with the stunning, superb cast makes this movie what it is. It's funny, dramatic, uplifting, subtle all in one. I came out totally inspired, feeling better about life. All of this works well because the movie is never, ever manipulative as happens for 90% of true stories movies. It is so brilliantly underplayed, with attention to small things over larger than life concepts. It makes you appreciate humanity in its truest forms, you follow a large amount of characters and you get to know them all profoundly. Some movies don't even manage to make you appreciate the main character, this one manages to make you emphasize with more than a dozen. None of these are overplayed or exaggerated people, they all feel honest and real, by the end of the movie I felt so involved with them, it seemed I had known them forever. I can't stress enough how good the character work is here, it is so rare to find such a treasure. But all of this wouldn't be possible without the cast assembled. With the SAG nominations just out this week, I just want to make a point about how disgusting is the awards machine, the awards campaigning. It takes away what they should be really about which is true quality, not shaking hands! This to say that it's preposterous for this movie not to have been nominated for best ensemble. It's so unfair. This cast deserves to win that f**** award! This is the best cast ensemble performance I have seen in way too long. And is destroys me not to see this movie have the attention it deserves only because it is a too small movie and doesn't have the support of the other bigger independents. This is what awards should do, bring about to the public these gems of cinema. But that's me bragging. Point is: cast=amazing, amazing, amazing! Faye Marsay in particular was just a force of nature on the screen, I literally couldn't take my eyes off her. Even in the scenes where she served as background I was looking at her, she was so into her role.

This movie doesn't make it to a 9 for me by just a millimeter. It had some cringe moments, some slightly over the top/surreal interventions, some storytelling shortcutting that kept me from forgetting this was a movie. They aren't frequent, but when they came they took some of the magic away and lessened the end result. Yet, that's all I have to say on the negative side.

Go see this movie now! You will come out feeling like a better person, wanting to do something good for the world.",8.0,13 December 2014
An Indisputable Success,"Rarely is a film able to combine comedy and heart as expertly as Matthew Warchus's ""Pride"". As a gay man myself I am clearly biased, however in my eyes, the film is a well deserving comedy of the year.

Yet, underneath the comical façade of the film lies commentary on real issues faced by the gay community that remain relevant in 2014. I recommend to those looking for a political film chronicling the feud between miners and Margaret Thatcher to search elsewhere as the story takes a much larger focus on the struggles of the gay community with an emphasis on a central human experience.

Brilliant performances by relatively untested Ben Schnetzer (Mark) and George MacKay (Joe) as well as film veterans such as Bill Nighy (Cliff) and Imelda Staunton (Hefina) only work to enrich the expertly crafted script recounting the real life events of 1984 U.K.

Any person who critises the use of gay stereotypes in the film, I encourage you to accept these for what they are which is a comedic release for what could otherwise at times be rather macabre viewing.

In conclusion, ""Pride"" is a film of love, family, camaraderie and respect. Upon coming out of the theatre, I was awash with an undiluted sense of - for want of a better word - Pride in who I am and what the film represents. I think this film is important in its potential to create the same sense of pride in young members of the LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning) community and any other minority and show them they are not alone.

One of the best pro-Union flicks ever . . .,,10.0,23 October 2014
"The best feel-good gay movie since ""Beautiful Thing""","Relying solely on his material, a terrific script by Stephen Beresford and a bevy of flawless performances, theatre director Matthew Warchus, (this is only his second film), has made in ""Pride"" the best feel-good gay movie since ""Beautiful Thing"" as well as a powerful piece of political maneuvering in much the same vein as ""Brassed Off"". In 1984 a small group of lesbian and gay activists based in London decided to raise money for the Welsh miners during Britain's almost year long miner's strike. It was an uphill struggle; they had to battle the miner's homophobia for a start but their determination and their winning personalities won the day. As we know, the miners lost but out of this alliance a bond between the Trade Union movement and gay rights groups was forged that still exists to this day.

To enjoy ""Pride"", and it is a hugely enjoyable film, a knowledge of the events portrayed isn't any more necessary than being gay, a miner or even particularly left-wing in your beliefs. This is a humanist entertainment that is as funny as it is moving. It doesn't shy away from issues like homophobia and AIDS but its ultimate message is entirely positive. In a superb cast it's only fair to single out Bill Nighy, Imelda Staunton, Dominic West, (he's centre stage in one of the films two great musical interludes), Paddy Considine and Andrew Scott. Of the younger cast members George MacKay as a young activist coming to terms with his homosexuality, edges out his co-star and the film's ostensible male lead Ben Schnetzer but then almost everyone on screen makes their mark in what is a great ensemble. I can already see it seizing a slew of BAFTA nominations next year. Hopefully it will also make it across the Atlantic. British cinema has built up a good relationship with Oscar and there is no reason why ""Pride"" can't continue that relationship; it really is that good.",9.0,17 September 2014
We spend a good time,"In 1984 in England, Margaret Thatcher or the ""Iron Lady"" is in office. She's hated by a large part of the English population. There are people who wanted to leave the country because of her. Pride is a movie about a beautiful meeting of two different communities : a group of gays ans lesbians, ans a village in Wales : a miners' village. Gays ans lesbians are discriminated against, and M.Thatcher wants to close down coal mines. The group of gays decide to raise money to help the miners. But the village seems to be shy to receive money from a group of gays and lesbians. Thus begins the beautiful story of two totally different communities.

It's not only a movie about discrimination against gays, it's a beautiful movie about friendship and solidarity. The cast is very well chosen, the actors are amazing. It's a wonderful battle against a politician, a nice union between two totally different communities. I can't say that this movie is at the top of my favorite movies, but it's a nice movie, we spend a good time seeing it. It's a must-see !",5.0,8 May 2015
Excellent,"I saw this yesterday. A moving funny film based on true events in 1984 when the British miners were fighting for their jobs against the threat of closure of all the mines by Margaret Thatcher. I knew nothing of LGSM, but having checked it out when I got home this seems to be a very accurate portrayal. Bill Nighy for once is not type cast, usually an ageing lover, but as a very shy welsh man. Imelda Staunton always performs well, this time as a strong welsh woman. But the best performance is from Ben Schetzner as Mark. An actor I know little about but his performance was superb. the issue that Mark was a communist and this was not portrayed I think is a minor issue, although I did notice he wore the communist red star. The whole cast were great, I cannot rate this film highly enough and recommend you see it",10.0,16 September 2014
An outstanding British film of which all involved should be forever proud.,"Pride is the sort of film that we should be making in the UK again and again. Well written, extremely well-acted by an exceptionally gifted cast, a story that is both relevant today, powerful, very funny and at times extremely moving. Back in the 1980s the miners were not the only people clashing with Margaret Thatcher's unsympathetic constabulary but minorities had their own issues too. Mark Ashton (Played here with appropriate energy by Ben Schnetzer) was a historic gay activist back in that time. He was someone who believed that people who were bullied and stepped on by the establishment should unite against the common enemy and it is his real life efforts and those that followed him that are depicted in this film as a group of Gay activists unite to support the miners, raising money for one village in Wales picked at random and then descended upon by the group. So the scene is set for a clash of cultures and sexual attitudes among the hills of the valleys where several of our key characters discover more about themselves in the first place. This very easily could have been a relatively lame, overly camp mediocre film in the wrong hands, but here the ship is well steered by both writer and director. The performances all round are outstanding and even those actors in smaller and cameo roles, Freddie Fox, Faye Marsay among them really make an impact. George McKay is really one of our rising stars and proves his versatility here handling his nervous 'Joe' dealing with his first time issues and repressive parents. Paddy Considine who seems to never give a bad performance in anything is great here and backed up by veterans Dominic West and a feisty Imelda Staunton. This is the first time I have seen Andrew Scott who here plays the role of Gethin, a young Welsh gay man who finds himself travelling home for the first time in 15 years and facing a mother he hasn't spoken to for the same time. He plays off his emotional temperament against West's flamboyance beautifully, making their relationship all the more believable. These neat little character sub plots are skilfully woven into the main story without them seeming trite or unnecessary and giving the characters the appropriate level of weight to give the storyline real emotional punch when it comes. Bill Nighy is as always on form and I hope we can see him in as many films as he feels he can gives, adding as he always does, quality that is rarely equalled by few, but here everyone just does an outstanding job. This is a film anyone can enjoy, it's not a niche film nor should it have a niche audience and you do not need to relate to the issues in the film to find yourself feeling for the various characters and their personal battles as well as those being fought at the pits on the grander scale. My wife and I enjoyed it immensely. Where the film packs a real punch is in one brief scene which I must give a special mention too. As Ashton tries to get his community to support the miners he fails to take on board the struggle that they themselves are facing as AIDS begins to invade its way into their circles. No moment in the film is more powerful than that when he briefly comes across an old flame who is drugged up to the eyeballs on his last hurrah knowing that his future is going to be very short. For a film to pack such power into a mere two minute segment anchored by an especially effective cameo by Russell Tovey with just total hopelessness in his eyes, says much about this truly special film. I made myself go and it, as I hadn't been to the cinema in ages due to work commitments, but I felt this one was a movie to experience on the big screen, and a dam good experience it was too.",9.0,22 September 2014
"An inspirational film laughter, tears people being people","What a refreshing change, to watch something that has value, as well as being entertaining, it made me laugh it made me cry. I although no film critic, i thought it was wonderfully acted and the script was great. I would recommend that you go and see it. I saw it in a local cinema this evening, there were only 30 - 40 people watching it, but i was amazed because at the end of this film not one person left there seat people just started to talk about this extraordinary touching film.

The film is not overtly political but very much reflects on the human condition during the hot bed of the 1984 miners strike. A watershed for industrial politics and some would argue the demasculation of the trade union movement

but it seems a coming together of minds which were ones miles apart.",10.0,24 September 2014
powerful and funny,"It's 1984. Mark Ashton comes up with an idea for gays and lesbians to collect money and support striking miners. He starts the group Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners. Joe 'Bromley' Cooper is 20 year old and still hasn't come out to his parents. The small group raises some money but have difficulties finding miner unions to take the money. Local union leader Dai Donovan (Paddy Considine) is confused but nevertheless grateful for the money. Dai returns to controversy as some oppose the support from the gay community.

Paddy Considine's speech in the gay bar is so powerful. There are lots of powerful moments as well as some hilarious ones. If there is one minor problem, it's that the villain of the piece does need to be played more powerfully. The movie could have used Imelda Staunton in that role to give the group a more formidable obstacle. The greater the obstacle. The greater the drama.",8.0,28 July 2015

Another decent British film ruined by terrible incidental music,"There are some superb performances in this film - Bill Nighy, Paddy Considine, Andrew Scott - as one would expect. However, like countless other British films of this genre, it's ruined either by silly twee scenes (e.g. Old Welsh ladies enjoying a pint in a Soho fetish club with gay men in leather caps) or by appalling incidental music.

The latter is either terrible guitar 80's-session-musician-twiddling rubbish (serving no purpose whatsoever and notably absent from French cinema etc), or it's wipe-a-tear-away ""rousing"" orchestral sweeps. In several scenes, there's a weird phenomena peculiar to this kind of British film, where a character's dialogue is actually drowned out by the music, leaving the camera on them shouting/laughing/screaming mutely while we, the audience, are presumably supposed to be moved to tears or whatever. Instead, it's usually cringe-inducingly mawkish.

It doesn't have to be this way - Submarine, directed by Richard Ayoade, managed to be both hilarious and moving, without a single note of terrible jangly major chord 80s Stratocaster noodling.",5.0,1 August 2023

Perfect balance,"Before even being made, this film had the huge advantage of having an extraordinary and a emotionally compelling real story as its raw material. I can't imagine how anyone would not be moved to tears by this story.

Of course good raw material doesn't automatically make a good film - plenty of examples to the contrary exist, so what we have here is a perfectly executed artistic achievement from start to finish: the screenplay, the acting, the direction, the cinematography, the music. It's one of those times when stars align to make something perfect. The balance between emotion and lightheartedness is incredible, the cast is outstanding, the pacing doesn't miss a beat.

"Well, written, well acted, well filmed, well told","26 September 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza This Afternoon - Pride. I remember the miners strike but I don't remember this story. This is the tale of a group of Gay and Lesbian activists who were passionate about the plight facing the striking miners and how they raised money for them. Against all the odds they take what they have collected to a mining community in Wales and little by little they win over the people who at first want nothing to do with those 'perverts' from London. This film was astonishing in it honesty. In no way could anyone be offended by the lifestyle choices portrayed and it's a very moving account of what people have to live through who whose to live their lives out if the norm. This is not just true of the gay and lesbian communities but was also made apparent by one particular woman in the welsh village who by her actions set her apart from everyone else. Once the film was over, I felt that apart from the historical timing of the miners strike, that this is a story which will carry on evolving and will be told in many different ways in years to come. Although we consider ourselves much more liberated in our thoughts and ways these days, I just wonder if this tale would have been any different if it was happening in 2014. An outstanding cast, Imelda Staunton for me was most marvellous, I wouldn't want to cross her when she's on a mission. This film took a good script and told it as a great story. A really thought provoking watch.....I want to see it again.",10.0,26 September 2014
A true inspiration,"What a delightful experience.

Pride tells the inspiring true story of how a small group of gay men in London noticed that the police had been leaving them alone. Instead of celebrating a lack of persecution, they sought out the new targets of aggression and became, as the film put it, a friend who you never knew existed. The beautiful direction by Matthew Warchus really captures the wide range of emotion in Pride, the somber, lean times and the moments of colour and fun, and how much more these men and women injected into this small Welsh town. As one character puts it, its not just money, it was morale.

The script by Stephen Beresford is absolutely spectacular, with beautiful dialogue and a complete lack of cliché. The words delivered by the anti-gay crowd are so well chosen that they avoid being caricatures, and manage remind you that whilst we may consider them abhorrent today, this was really a different time. The humour is delivered with such dry wit that it always takes me by surprise, and to see most of it delivered by a gaggle of little old Welsh ladies was so refreshing that it made everything ten times funnier.

The acting is superb across the board, and by the film's conclusion I really was not ready to say goodbye to these wonderful characters. Perhaps the most endearing performances were Imelda Staunton as Hefina, Paddy Considine as Dai, Dominic West as Jonathan, Ben Schnetzer as Mark Ashton, Faye Marsay as Steph and Jessica Gunning as Siân James. Its really not a big name cast (most will only recognise Nighy and maybe Staunton). Dominic West's performance as the larger-than-life Jonathan, the first man in the UK diagnosed with AIDS, is my personal favourite, and leads to one of the best dance scenes I've ever seen.

Overall, the film is a tender, funny, and extremely inspirational story about how one group of people can help another group. Its a brilliant and respectful look at the gay community - as Bill Nighy's character says, ""the paper lies about us miners, why should we believe what they say about gays?"" Highly recommended, one of the best films of 2014.",10.0,25 November 2014
For us straight people,I thought it was pretty good. Some gay reviewers found legitimate fault I suppose but perhaps the general public for whom it was made still need to be taught tolerance. It was great to get out of America for a while and see the Welsh world. I liked the singing of the Welsh people too. It was nice to see tolerance a major theme of a movie. The acting was good and the script did not insult the intelligence. It holds the attention well and was never boring though it seemed a little too long towards the end. Yes not a bad effort and refreshing to get out of Hollywood for a while. The conversion to tolerance on the part of some was not fully explained but over all it was well paced. One could relate to the characters- there was a certain credibility to this film but hard-line gay activists might be able to pick holes in it.,8.0,8 November 2014
bright and warm hearted,"""Pride"" is an entertaining film directed by Matthew Warchus and focusing on the initially reluctant then accepting attitude the straight residents of a Welsh community had towards the gay advocates. The cast includes some of the best actors Great Britain has shown and the film moves effectively from some pretty intense dramatic moments to hilarious scenes showing the contrasting lifestyles of the gay and straight worlds of incredible poignancy. In the ultimate analysis ""Pride"" artfully proves that many kinds of people who have apparently nothing in common in the end share more than they might realize. The story is based upon true events.",8.0,11 January 2015
A social history that hits the mark,"I am not going to review this wonderful film as it is probably the most perfect film of it's type(However I have got to write 10 lines).

The one thing that I have found with all the reviews that I have read (which have been fantastic) is that they have mist a major point. The first 40 minutes of the film are very unnerving, you are always under the suspicion that something very nasty is going to occur even when you are laughing with a stitch. A great credit to the direction. (By the way I have never felt like writing a comment about a film on any site until PRIDE)

What I want to share is the video that LGSM produced a year after the events took place. It shows what a wonderful job that the Director, script writer and casting director did. Enjoy

If we only could understand the accents..,"Stephen Beresford has scripted a version of a true story that is both entertaining and compassionate and inspiring. The story is well known but seeing it played out by such a fine group of actors is touching that such a tribute has been made to a cause célèbre. In the summer of 1984 Margaret Thatcher is in power and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is on strike. At the Gay Pride March in London, a group of gay and lesbian activists decides to raise money to support the families of the striking miners. But there is a problem. The Union seems embarrassed to receive their support. But the activists are not deterred. They decide to ignore the Union and go direct to the miners. They identify a mining village in deepest Wales and set off in a mini bus to make their donation in person. And so begins the extraordinary story of two seemingly alien communities who form a surprising and ultimately triumphant partnership.

The story works because of the emphasis on the prejudice and harassment of two dissimilar minority groups who discover the similarities between them. It is made more personal by giving us glimpse at the th individuals involved: 20 year old closet gay Joe (George MacKay) hesitantly arrives in London from Bromley for his first Gay Pride march and is taken under the collective wing of a group of gay men and Lesbian Steph (Faye Marsay), who meet at flamboyant Jonathan (Dominic West) and his Welsh partner Gethin's (Andrew Scott) Soho bookshop. Not only are gays being threatened by Thatcher but the miners are on strike in response to her pit closures and Northern Irish activist Mark Ashton (Ben Schnetzer) believes gays and miners should show solidarity. Almost by accident a mini-bus full of gays find themselves in the Welsh village of Onllwyn in the Dulais valley and through their sincere fund raising and Jonathan's nifty disco moves persuade most of the community that they are on the same side. When a bigot tries to sabotage the partnership with a tabloid smear Mark turns it back on her with a hugely successful benefit concert to which most of the villagers, now thoroughly in tune with their gay friends, turn up. The miners are defeated and return to work but at the Pride march the following year a vast contingent of miners show up to repay their comrades with their show of support.

Among the cast members are Paddy Considine, Jessica Gunning, Imelda Staunton, Bill Nighy and a very fine cast of lesser known actors. It works, and if it is predictable so be it – it is deeply touching and would benefit from a large audience attendance. Grady harp, December 14",9.0,25 December 2014
556th Review - One of the Best of British Films,"I am a huge, huge fan of British Film - in particular comedy-dramas from 1932 - 1961. In 1949, just after making Kind Hearts & Coronets, Alec Guinness made A Run For Your Money about two Welsh Miners who win £200 and are sent to London. It has everything that Lion, Gainsborough, and Ealing were to make staples of.

Pride is the closest thing this reviewer has seen this decade to the huge legacy and spirit of 50s cinema - it has a message, but it entertains - massively. It is joyful, moving, deeply deeply inspiring and above all it's simply watchable, as in real story-telling and humanity. I need to go back via Full Monty to Brassed Off to remember a film that really does hit home this hard while still being a British Comedy. It takes both the Gay Pride movement and the Miners' Strike of 1984 and produces a film that is moving and funny.

If you want a great film that will make you remember what it's like to really experience life then go see Pride - it captures the early Eighties in Britain brilliantly with excellent performances and a zinging script. This is what cinema should be about - it'll make you laugh and cry and it'll stir your spirit.",10.0,23 December 2014
A feel good movie that I will totally recommend,"Hefina:""Jesus God that takes me back!""

Pride takes place in the summer of 1984, the UK National Union of Mineworkers began a lengthy strike. During this trying period, they are given an unexpected boost from gay and lesbian activists as well.

""Uplifting, inspiring and heart hitting"". - From all the critics reviews. All those Quotes you see there is all from the critic who reviewed this picture, and I can see what there saying but I'm sorry but ""Inspiring and heart hitting"", those are so cliché for critics to say and to be honest I didn't really feet inspired or over the moon with this movie, now don't get me wrong I thought this was a good movie, it really is, but I don't think it's flawless as critic's are making it out to be. It's a simply movie about Pride and respect and I like those kind of films, like the 2008 film staring Sean Penn Milk The film heart is in the right place and I got to say that this movie get's it's message across without shoving it into your face like other movies that fail to do that so well done Pride.

The performance from everyone was pretty good, nobody did a crap performance, there where all good. The story in this is really interesting and I always like those kind of true stories movies where after wards I can look up to see the real person and read more about them, I always look forward to that. The directing and the writing was all good.

Now for Flaws and they's only some like: I didn't really get that fist in the high feeling that most people said I will get, yeah the movie left me feeling good inside but to be honest I didn't really feel that Hands in the air""YEAH! that's so good stuff"", feeling.

I'm glad the movie Pride was made. I may not felt super inspirited after the movie but doesn't mean you will. I say go watch this movie,it's well done. I will totally recommend",8.0,30 December 2014

Fabulous film.,"An absolute feel-good film, beautifully crafted, filled with interesting and well-enacted historical detail, excellent cinematography, top-notch writing, pitch-perfect acting, and classy straightforward directing.

Based on a true story, this gem of a film memorialises events which though politically significant are largely overlooked by history. We all remember the miner's strike of 1984-5, but how many people remember (or were ever even aware of) the pivotal role of the gay and lesbian community in that historic clash, or what transpired in British politics as a result of it?

This is a terrific film on many levels; as a piece of entertainment it is well-paced and enjoyable throughout, lifting the spirits and raising an occasional tear. As a historical re-enactment it is well researched, enlightening, and nostalgic. As a political commentary it is thoughtful, articulate, intelligent, and avoids pretty much every potential pitfall, with not a sledgehammer to be seen.

All in all, a very well-rounded piece of British filmmaking that ticks many boxes. Worth a watch. Or two. Or three...",10.0,9 July 2018
Just brilliant!,"It is an enormous task to make a film seriously yet funny. This film, however, delivers! Some questions remain unanswered, but the fact that it's about real people, real differences; it made me cry. This is how the world should be! Peaceful, without prejudice. If all the 'weaker' people come together, we can make a difference. And this film shows just that! It's full of empowerment, and that's what we need in 2019!",10.0,17 August 2019
Some stereotypes of course,"But overall this is really nicely developed and shot. Not to mention played by the actors. All based on real events, even though you might still wonder if there was more behind the support for the miners. But whatever the case, and even if you can't imagine some reactions and some insults (though look not further than Republicans in America and surely a lot of other countries too), they were for real. The fear of gay people is still out there ... unfortunately.

But while this obviously shows other sides and humans too (some clichés thrown into the mix, I have no idea what was artistic freedom and what really happened), it has some tough moments to get through. I don't think this will leave you cold and untouched (no pun intended). The movie stirs up emotions and is a really good drama",8.0,24 May 2015
Even more inspiring because it really happened.,"Pride (2014/I) was directed by Matthew Warchus, It's a docudrama about real events and real people. In 1984, Margaret Thatcher--The Iron Maiden--was in office, and she thought striking miners were a tedious annoyance. She did what she often did--ignored the problem, stayed the course, and waited for cold and hunger to do the rest.

In an astonishing turn of events, members of London's gay and lesbian communities formed a group to support the miners. Through what was basically a miscommunication, the gays and lesbians arrived at a small Welsh mining town. This town was far from London--both geographically and in their feelings about gays and lesbians. Nonetheless, the gays and lesbians became a major source of funds for the miners in the village.

The acting is superb, the story would be incredible if it weren't true, and some of the scenes are hilarious. There were quite a few starring roles in Pride, but my nomination for best actor is Jessica Gunning as Sian. Director Warchus could have chosen someone like Emma Stone to play the role. Waif-like, slender, and non-threatening. Instead he chose Jessica Gunning, who has none of these attributes. However, she can act! She's a housewife who turns out to be a superb organizer. Be sure to watch the credits at the end of the film to learn what Sian did next.

We saw this film on the large screen at the excellent Dryden Theatre, in the George Eastman Museum in Rochester. It was screened as part of the wonderful Rochester Labor Film Series. Although it's probably better to see this movie on a large screen, it will certainly work well enough on the small screen. Just don't miss it!",10.0,5 November 2015
Great film !,"Pride is a great film, it is the must-see of all films this year. It speaks about the miners strike which took place in the 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was in power as Prime Minister. It is good for people like me, between 15 and 20 years old, to watch this film because it teaches us the story of a group of miners and a group of gays and lesbians who were faced with dark times. But the price of admission is too expensive, it's really unfair. This film is not only for a group of gays and lesbians, it for everybody. It is very emotional and it mixes funny moments with moving scenes. But it is too long. Action is slow moving, I think two hours is too long for this film. We see the same thing too many times.

The film takes place in summer 1984, when a group of lesbians and gays decide to raise money to help miners' families in Wales. The plot is very touching because this film shows two different communities who are fighting against the same opposition. I loved this film, and I think it'll be a hit because of the cast and the plot however if you love action films, I would not recommend this film. Indeed, this film doesn't show much action because it's a comedy about a true story. So, on a scale of O to 10, i give this film an 8 and remember it's only my opinion.

Chappy Watched: Pride,"Wow. This was such a beautiful movie.

It is a true story but it's not a story I knew anything about. While politics is a big part of the reason for the events of the film, it is nowhere near a political film.

This movie is very story and character orientated and it not at all flashy, over the top or too Hollywood.

I can't even begin to say how brilliant the cast is with the likes of Andrew Scott (Sherlock), Joseph Gilgun (Misfits), Dominic West (The Affair), Paddy Considine (The World's End), Imelda Staunton (Harry Potter) and Bill Nighy (Love Actually) but the one person who always drew my attention was Jessica Gunning, who played Sian.

"Funny, inspiring and thought-provoking, even if it is over-romanticised and has too many endings.","It's disconcerting when the news of your childhood becomes the historical movies of your adulthood. Pride did nothing if not confirm for me that I have officially hit middle-age.

It's a British comedic-drama about events during the Miners Strike in the UK of 1984 (I was 11, just about aware of what was going on in the wider-world). It focuses on two small communities: one is a small mining town in Wales of the sort that suffered most during that time. The other is a London-based group of gay and lesbian people who form LGSM (Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners). They take on the small Welsh community as a project for which to fundraise. The film is that story, of unlikely friendships and culture-clashes. In tone it is closes to British comedies like The Full Monty or Brassed Off; an edge of social realism and a triumph of underdogs storyline.

There's some fine performances - Bill Nighy is at his understated best, drawing laughs at times without uttering a word; the comedic tone sits well with some serious themes of social distress and prejudice and it's hard not to leave the cinema without at least a small air-punch of satisfaction at the film's feel good narrative arc.

It's not without flaws though. Some things just seem a little too easy to be true; did they really, for instance, break into singing that easily in the minibus? At times the adventures of the London-based characters come off too much like a school outing rather than engaging with one of the biggest social issues of the day. More seriously is an overly romantic view of history. The miners' strike was a brutal and painful period of British history for all sorts of reasons, not least because it fractured families and communities. The film presents to us a picture of communities and towns united in their stand; I can't speak for the individual town in question, but the brutal reality of the strike is that it was opposed from within the community of miners as well as by the government. Members of families fell into bitter, lifelong dispute; strike-breakers were, and maybe still are, 'scabs'. All this because some felt they and their families couldn't pay the price of their families' well-being. It's tempting to, as the film does, to play the strike as a unified struggle; but it wasn't and it does a grave injustice to the complexity of real people in unimaginably difficult situations to pretend otherwise.

None of this detracts from the joy of the film; it should also be noted, though, that the nature of the film means that the humour is broader than The Full Monty (it really is); and sometimes that too (especially towards the end) seems a bit too easy to be true. The film also suffers slightly from Return Of The King-itis in that seems to have about three endings. By the time the last one rolled around I was ready for the film to actually end.

It doesn't outstay its welcome, though. The reservations are real, but not major problems.",8.0,10 February 2015
A creative action leads to powerful impacts,"The above statement can refer to both the movie and to when it happened in the 80's. A simple innocuous looking movie at first, shows to me, the powerful impacts of common grassroots activism and powerful filmmaking, when done creatively. Powerful, sad, inspiring.",8.0,18 July 2020
Entertaining and engaging,"This is a good film. It is highly entertaining and engaging. It has a fabulous soundtrack. Jonathan, you ain't the only one who misses disco!

Dominic West is a scene-stealer. Not because he's a ham or a bad actor. Far from it. The entire cast is believable and put in solid performances, but he stands out so well and performs so well in the role of Jonathan. It was made just for him.

The story is interesting, showing us a slice of British history from a new and different angle. It's a nice juxtaposition of the personal coming-out of Joe/Bromley, performed nicely by George MacKay with historical events during the early to mid- 80s during the Thatcher regime. (I was surprised that England was so homophobic during that time--at least the Londoners in the film are.)

Ben Schnezer also puts in a nice performance, as do all of the cast performing as Welsh villagers and miners.",8.0,9 February 2015

Just How It Was,"This movie, is just like it was back in 1985, of course I did not know any better. The Gay Activists in the bookshop were Exactly like the Brighton Gay Youth Group, with the same ideals and passion. The Gay Bashings where just the same tho more common. The dance music brought back good memories as did the night clubs and the underground fun. Coal Miners were the most Heterosexual cliché you could imagine. So what is interesting with the effect that the Welsh Coal Miners had on changing gay law in the UK, they did not forget that Gays were out collecting money for the starving miners that Margaret Thatcher was crushing. I was at that Gay Pride in 1985 and this movie is pretty accurate. What is shocking is that this is 30 years ago and some parts of the USA have not moved forward and just as retarded (given what they had to do with the posters). This is not a movie for religious fundamentalist or far right republicans.",10.0,7 March 2015

Vivid Dramatization of a Turning Point in Contemporary British History,"PRIDE is one of those films which makes you realize that the cinema as an art form can still be highly political without sacrificing other qualities such as story, plot, and characterization.

In terms of subject-matter it resembles Mark Harmon's BRASSED OFF (1996), as it tells of the effect of the miners' strike of 1985-6 on a local community threatened with pit closures. In the earlier film the subject centered on a brass band; in PRIDE director Matthew Warchus looks at the ways in which a South Welsh community reacts to the help offered them by a London-based group Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners.

The initial reaction might be to recall Matt Lucas's classic running gag in the television comedy LITTLE Britain, where he played Dafydd Thomas, ""the only gay in the village."" Perhaps, predictably the Welsh villagers resent the group's presence among them - especially the aggressively masculine miners who feel that gays somehow threaten their status as opinion-formers. Yet such opinions soon change, due in no small part to the efforts of the wives, led by Hefina (Imelda Staunton) and supported by closet gay Cliff (Bill Nighy). In the end everyone comes together in a show of support for the miners, even though their cause is ultimately hopeless.

While the feelgood factor is obviously high, as director Matthew Warchus shows how people of different socio-economic backgrounds learn to accommodate one another in a show of solidarity, we cannot help but feel angry at what happened to the mining communities as a result of Prime Minister Thatcher's policies. Coal-mining as an industry might have been expensive to maintain, but there was really no excuse to impose such a swingeing program of pit-closures that destroyed individuals' lives. The motivation was entirely political: the Conservative government wanted to extinguish the power of the trade unions, especially the National Union of Mineworkers led by Arthur Scargill, and were prepared to go to any lengths to achieve their aims. By doing so they helped to create the social and regional inequalities that persist in contemporary British society.

In hindsight films such as PRIDE show how pointless such policies actually were. The only real result was to deprive working people of their livelihoods and destroy long-established communities. And that is not really much of a legacy for any government.",8.0,27 August 2016
Stronger together,"Pride takes us back to the 80' and tells a story of people who make a connection, despite totally different way of life. My opinion of the message of the storyline, is that we have to stay together when times are tough, and we have to take a stand with those who struggles around us. In this case between a gay community in London and the hard reality of workers who fights for their jobs. It's very well done, and if you like good English storytelling movies, this is the one for you. It's a strong and compelling story, but the film has also a lot of humour and hilarious scenes that will make you laugh. Finally the film also shows a lot very good performances from young, British actors and actresses, that I am sure of we will see more of in the near future.",8.0,22 July 2015
Pride is an English movie which speaks of a group of gay who help miners on strike.,"It's a good movie, with very good actors and good script. But the story is slow to start, the movie plot is bad. In the movie gay support miners with the money raised. But the miners seem be embarrassed by this donation and first they refuse. Finally they accept it and congratulate them this gift. Mattew Warchus has made a very good movie with a lot of incredible elements but the quality of the script is not excellent . However, it's a good movie and I recommend to see Pride but the ticket is too expensive for his movie, nevertheless, it's a good lesson for children an homophobia to stop discrimination against gay or lesbian people ; there are a lot of great people who are gay or lesbian ; I recommend to see this movie.",8.0,11 May 2015

The reaction of miners' families when they see the association of gays and lesbians from London, arrive in their village, is a little bit sad and cold, but then I think these two communities create an exceptional and beautiful relationship between the two so different group.This relationship makes the movie really cute.

Definitely a crowd-pleaser!,"'PRIDE': Four Stars (Out of Five)

Comedy-drama flick based on the true story of a group of gay activists who decided to help striking miners out, in the summer of 1984 London. It was directed by Matthew Warchus and written by actor, turned first time feature film writer, Stephen Beresford. The movie stars Ben Schnetzer, George MacKay, Faye Marsay, Andrew Scott, Dominic West, Imelda Staunton, Paddy Considine and Bill Nighy. It's received almost universally positive reviews from critics and has been nominated for multiple awards, including a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. I found the film to be well made and pleasantly entertaining.

The story takes place in 1984 London; when miners were on strike, from the National Union of Mineworkers, due to pit closures. A group of gay activists, and their lesbian friend (Marsay), decided it could be a good idea to try and join forces with the miners; due to the pressures they were feeling of their own. Under the leadership of a young Irish gay man, named Mark Ashton (Schnetzer), the activists raised a bunch of money and drove a mini-van to Onllwyn, a Welsh village in the Dulais valley, to show their support. After some initial fear, and rejection, a small union formed between the two groups.

The movie is funny and surprisingly sweet. It's also a great history lesson (I for one didn't know anything about these events). Most of all it's just inspiring; how outcasts, with completely different lifestyles and upbringings, can come together and help each other out. The film shows that you're never alone, if you look hard enough. It's cleverly written, adequately directed and full of touching performances. Definitely a crowd-pleaser if you're in the mood for an uplifting film.

An absolute must-see,"This film is a blend of ""comedy"" and emotion. It takes place in the UK, during the miners strike because of Margaret Thatcher who was in office. During the gay pride, a group of gays and lesbians decide to raise money for the miners on strike. The actors are very good, the film gives many different forms of feelings to the spectator because sometimes it's funny, sometimes tragic... I personally recommend this movie because it's not slow-moving or boring but entertaining. I think that it's a must-see because it shows how two different communities (gays and lesbians and miners' families) can be very helpful and it teaches a lot about the miners' strike. This film is a powerful movie and I think that, still today, for the struggle against gay and lesbian discrimination, it's good because the movie shows that homosexuals are normal people, very helpful and nice. I've also appreciated this film because there is a happy end and I like that. So I give nine stars because it's a magical film but maybe a little bit long.",9.0,11 May 2015
"Fun, moving true story","'Pride' is a simple British film that manages to be about lots of things all at once, all while being charming and quaint, as only the Poms can do! It's set in London (and Wales) in 1984 and follows a small group of gay & lesbian activists who decide to do stand up to the Thatcher government - not for gay rights, but for the rights of the striking miners! It's all handled quite well and doesn't become a full on drama, or a full on comedy - or even a full on ""political"" or ""gay"" movie.

Sure, there's definitely lots of political messages being explored - and you would like to think the world, in general, is a more tolerant place 30 years later - but the film's really about this group of six friends banding together and supporting another put-upon group, a small mining community in Wales. This is where a lot of the humour comes from - the old Welsh ladies having fun with ""their gays"" and ""their lesbians""!

The cast is superb - even though Nighy is probably under-utilised - with Mark (Schnetzer) & Joe (McKay) particularly captivating. The soundtrack/score is also great, although there's obviously some disco! Well-paced and with a great ending, this is a very enjoyable film.",8.0,2 January 2018

"Pride, a film full of history","I'm going to talk to you about a film entitled ""Pride"", and I will give you my opinion about it. The film talks about gay rights and miners rights in the UK in 1984 during the gay awkward in London. And during this gay pride, gays hear that miners are on strike because of their work conditions ; so they decide to support them because they are persecuted, just like them. So they go to Wales, the area where a lot of miners live and ask people in the streets to give them some money for the miners, to help them because they stopped working so they don't have any money. The Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, never gave in to the miners' strike. If you want to know the end of the film, go to the cinema and see it! I have a good opinion about this film, on a scale of zero to ten I give it an eight. The actors and actresses are good, the soundtrack during the moments of action is perfect, the quality of the pictures is good ; about the way of making the film I can't say anything bad. The film is really interesting because it shows the reality of horror of discrimination in the former century, it teaches us history. The only negative point I can say is that the film is a little too long and at the end of the film I was bored. But it's a hit, so I recommend you to go to cinema as soon as possible!!",8.0,7 May 2015

"A really good ""feel good"" movie","Not terribly true in some ways, this highly entertaining and moving film about British gays and lesbians in the early 80's coming to the assistance of striking miners at a time when AIDS is starting to hit home, is pure enjoyment from start to finish. Despite the mention of AIDS, this is not a sad film, though some of the information supplied at the end about the outcomes of some of the true life characters is indeed sad. This has an absolutely wonderful cast with established actors like Bill Nighy, Imelda Staunton, Paddy Considine and Dominic West plus a couple of newbies, in 2014, who would go on to terrific careers, George MacKay and Andrew Scott plus an actor named Ben Schnetzer who I am totally unfamiliar with and one who gives a fine performance in a prominent role.

You must watch it,"This is British Film in 2014. This is the story about sexual minority and the strike by miners, and based on a true story. They have no connection at first, but they are getting along to gradually.

In 1984, miners in the UK strike. People who are sexual minorities such as lesbian and gay begin to whip-round for them. They try to contribute money that they gathered to The British Labor Union of Miners, but they refuse to be supported by LGSM because, at that time, there are few people who declare about their homosexual nature. They refuse many time, however, the members of LGSM do not give up and decide to support the coal pit in Wales. Feeling the members' passion and consideration, miners and their families start to understand them and they become good friend.

The theme of this film is very new and I was very impressed by it. In Japan, it is still disturbed that LGBT people declare about themselves. Although some sexual minority entertainers appeared in TV there days, many children are tormented by the problem that they can not talk about it to their parents or friends because of prejudice in Japan. I think many people are visiting to Japan in the future. In the world, many countries start to understand and admit the right of LGBT people. Japan should move on like them. This film make you think about LGBT people and their situation, feeling and worries about their future that they may can not be understood by their parents and friends.

"A beautiful movie, an absolute must-see!","Here is a little synopsis for you : the story took place in 1984 while Margaret Thatcher (nicknamed ''The Iron Lady'') was in office as Prime Minister and the National Union of Mineworkers voted to go on a national strike. The movie is about the miners who decided to protest against the closing down of the coal mines. Following that, a group of gay and lesbian activists decided to raise funds to help the miners'families. Unfortunately the National Union of Miners seems to be shy to receive their money. Then begins the story (inspired from a real story) of two different communities in a period a dark times, both fighting the same cause: discrimination. This movie is a blend of comedy and courage. I strongly recommend it because it's a beautifully written and balanced movie with an excellent cast. You can also cry and laugh at the same time, isn't that marvelous? The message comes through clear and strong. It's a powerful movie and on a scale from zero to ten, I give this film a nine because it shows us solidarity and friendship.

Affectionate account of a grim time.,"A well made film which manages to blend the austerity of the national strike with the emerging gay rights struggle and throws in some 80's disco/club culture and working mens club culture which, to those of us present at the time, were an indispensable part of life. The growing awareness of aids, scapegoating of the gay community and 'queer bashing' are presented alongside the more traditional struggle of workers v state.
