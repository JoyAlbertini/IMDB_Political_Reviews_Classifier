It takes you through Bill McKay&apos;s campaign for California senator - and shows how an idealistic and inexperienced young man gets trapped by the media system. Most plot summaries will tell you that it is about how he gives the political system a kick - but I found that it was really more about how he became lost in it. It seemed that it was more of an &apos;outside&apos; movie than an &apos;inside&apos; one - there is always some mystery about what is going on inside everyone&apos;s heads. Robert Redford is really very good here as McKay - watch for a speech he makes to himself in the car. Peter Boyle also gave a thought-provoking performance, as Bill McKay&apos;s smooth-talking campaign manager. A sad commentary on the way things work. Very relevant. I recommend it for fans of Robert Redford or anybody interested in politics or media. 7 out of 10.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 7}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 11954, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 7}, "contentRating": "PG", "genre": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "datePublished": "1972-08-05", "keywords": "father son relationship,political rally,election,democratic party,american politics", "duration": "PT1H50M", "actor": [{"name": "Robert Redford", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000602/"}, {"name": "Peter Boyle", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001967/"}, {"name": "Melvyn Douglas", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002048/"}], "director": [{"name": "Michael Ritchie", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006916/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Jeremy Larner", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0488373/"}], "political_m": true}
