Thought-provoking look at politics and media.,"The Candidate, 1972, was a film that really made me think. It takes you through Bill McKay's campaign for California senator - and shows how an idealistic and inexperienced young man gets trapped by the media system. Most plot summaries will tell you that it is about how he gives the political system a kick - but I found that it was really more about how he became lost in it. It seemed that it was more of an 'outside' movie than an 'inside' one - there is always some mystery about what is going on inside everyone's heads. Robert Redford is really very good here as McKay - watch for a speech he makes to himself in the car. Peter Boyle also gave a thought-provoking performance, as Bill McKay's smooth-talking campaign manager. A sad commentary on the way things work. Very relevant. I recommend it for fans of Robert Redford or anybody interested in politics or media. 7 out of 10.",7.0,6 September 2000
Ahead of its time,"This 1972 feature film is funny as it is scary now in the Untied States we can see it as form of prophecy.

This film stars Robert Redford in a remarkable performance as a Senatorial Candidate in California. Robert plays Bill McKay as son of a former state senator who never planned on running for public office. In fact he has never registered to vote. A political election specialist talks him into running who is expertly played by the late Peter Boyle. What both Bill McKay never thinks of at the beginning is the fact he might win. Released in 1972 the film seemed as a farce but just like the 1976 film ""Network"" what once seemed impossible is now ""non fiction"".

Natalie Wood also appears as herself.",8.0,24 February 2018

Not bad,"Michael Ritchie seems to have this thing for competition -- whether downhill racing, body building, water skiing, or, as here, politics. This isn't my favorite human motive, besting other people, so this one comes as a rather pleasant surprise, laden as it is with more social and political content than the with the details of the quest. I mean -- Redford doesn't even want the office!

""The Candidate"" has the appearance of a made-for-TV movie. The credits are presented simply, as in a TV movies. There is no underscore but the music that we hear consists of marches with lots of drums and sometimes one or two instruments hitting clinkers, as they would on a bandstand behind a speaker.

The photography is highly colored and flat, as in a TV movie. Everybody seems to be dressed in suits or riding costumes. They look overly made up, freshly preened and pruned. They drive big new American cars and live in splendidly arid modern homes. In short they appear to lead the kind of lives to which naive screenwriters aspire.

That out of the way, this is a pretty brave movie. It's a story of an innocent and blunt lawyer who become progressively corrupted during the campaign as victory seems more nearly in his grasp and the grasp of his managers. They 86 his sideburns and give him a haircut and put him in expensive suits. Girls love him because he displays such, well, such Robert Redfordness. One guy belts him in the mouth at a rally and I can understand why. All men as handsome as Robert Redford should be illegal.

But he does a decent job in his minimal way. His forte lies in little moves, as when he cocks his head and says quizzically, ""Eh""? Everybody else is quite good too, though his wife is mostly decorative. Peter Boyle is fine, and Allan Garfinkle is always believable as a cynical scuzz.

You have to admire the way the script does not spare Redford's character. He may be an idealist at first. What does he think of abortion? ""I'm for it."" How about property taxes. ""I don't know."" By the end of the movie he's learned fluent politicospeak. How's he feel about busing? ""You can't solve the problems of this country with a bus."" (Right.) He knows that he's selling himself out but he wants to WIN.

As the campaign gets into high gear he's late for a meeting with a labor leader, a grizzled Kenneth Toby given to smoking pinched little cigarettes. Everybody in the room is wondering where Redford is, and how he can treat an important man like Toby with such disrespect. And where is he? We see the door to a hotel room open and there emerges a girl so gorgeous that if she were an escort instead of a groupie she'd be extremely expensive. A few seconds later Redford comes out buttoning his jacket.

Nothing much is made of this incident. Boyle watches this parade in the hallway, staring after the girl, but nobody says anything and the scene lasts for only a few seconds. And here is where Ritchie and the writers earn my respect. Think of how easily this very effective scene could have been demolished. Boyle stopping the groupie and demanding to know what's been going on. Boyle admonishing Redford for cheating on his wife -- ""If this ever gets out our goose is cooked!"" Redford protesting that his private life is his own business.

But none of this happens. Not in this scene or in any of the others in which a piece of character is revealed. Ritchie trusts in the perspicacity of the viewer. He shows us, because he doesn't have to tell us. He figures we're smart enough to pick up this clues by ourselves. Thank you, Mister Ritchie.

We should be grateful to the writer as well, and to Redford's improvisational talents, when, alone in a car's rear seat, half crazed, he mangles the stump speech he's given a thousand times and comes up with a hilarious parody: ""The basic indifference that made this country great.""

Also admirable is that the movie deals with specific issues -- abortion, busing, unemployment, fire hazard, health concerns -- and Redford is the Democratic candidate while Don Porter is the Republican candidate (imagine actually NAMING the political parties and risking losing half the audience).

Porter comes across like an actor, an old ham of an actor, which suits the part. He's smooth and wily at seducing the public, a kind of Don Juan of the political arena. Ritchie has taken some real chances here. Porter comes up with something like, ""Oh, sure, when I was a kid we were all poor too. Why some of us didn't even have our own SOCIAL WORKER.""

It took guts to make this movie. And talent to make it so well.",,15 April 2004
Sort of like what it would be like to hang out with a political candidate throughout the election.,"""The Candidate"" is a very simple movie. It follows a guy (Robert Redford) who is running for the Senate and you see him from agreeing to run to his eventual election. Throughout, the guy tries (not always successfully) to keep his idealism but there is a strong push by his handlers to get him to talk more and say less at the same time. This aspect of the story is very believable and this man is, more or less, relatively 'normal' and without any earth-shattering secrets or personal deficiencies. In fact, the film has little in the way of excitement--no 'bombshells', no real controversies--just a look at the political process and the men who handle these candidates. Certainly not a must-see film but well worth your time.",7.0,30 January 2015

A Scathing Commentary,"Only recently does it seem like the political world has been soiled by entertainment media. HBO's ""Veep"", created by the satirically minded Armando Iannucci, is a brutal comedy series that details the day to day life of the vice president. Don't expect to see an all-American woman pining for a better America, because you get a narcissist hungry for power. Netflix's ""House of Cards"" makes politics seem as dirty as the crime world, with elected officials offing enemies left and right, utilizing corruption for the sake of unbridled authority.

In days past, there was something mystical about a candidate — the one we loved (not the Nixon of the race) seemed to be a sort of god who could do no wrong. Look at JFK, FDR; they were far from perfect, but their image, their reputation, turned them into unspeakably untouchable icons. But it seems post-Vietnam, post-Watergate, America has turned into a hotbed of negativity. We don't trust our sacred politicians like we used to. And so ""The Candidate"" is more relevant than ever. In 1972, the U.S. was just starting to turn into a bunch of pessimists. But now, we regard many of our elected officials in the same way we do the villain of a political thriller: evil, devilishly evil. But smart.

""The Candidate"" is part black comedy, part political drama, all stitched together by an endlessly scathing screenplay and a finely tuned performance from Robert Redford. It isn't so much an emotional film as it is a witty commentary regarding the election process, and how most candidates go from freshly idealistic to power hungry after a mere few months of campaigning. The film doesn't tap into our fears in the same way ""All the President's Men"" did, or how ""Three Days of the Condor"" told us not to trust anyone sitting in office. Rather, it serves as a thought-provoker that makes us wonder if the smiles governmental hopefuls put on display are actually genuine. It's a bleak, bleak, movie, not so much because it is starkly negative but because it prefers to think that getting elected is a popularity contest, not a case of may the best man win.

Redford plays Bill McKay, a 30-ish attorney who, on a whim, decides to run for Senate. Incumbent Crocker Jarmon (Don Porter) is slated to win — McKay, you see, has been approached by political specialist Marvin Lucas (Peter Boyle), who only wants McKay to act as a Democratic figure, not as serious competition. Jarmon, after all, cannot run unopposed. McKay knows he has little by way of chance, but, knowing he has the opportunity to spread his ideals around the state, does everything he can to potentially find success. And as the son of the former governor (Melvyn Douglas), with, not to mention, good looks that have captured much of the female vote, his possibilities may be stronger than Lucas could have ever imagined. Problem is, if McKay really wants to win, he'll have to, in some ways, trade many of his morals in favor of popularity.

""The Candidate"" is filmed as if it were a documentary, following McKay around until his positive nature completely breaks down and sardonic ickiness takes over. As the film begins, he is a charismatic intellect who has a way with words (he is a lawyer, after all). But by the end, he can hardly control himself from laughing attacks when faced with the bullsh-t of a television promotion. The more he campaigns, the more he becomes disgusted with the idea of politics — the officials are snakes who know how to manipulate the public. Morals, he finds out, are of little importance to his peers. Sounding good, looking good, speaking well, being agreeable, going against the grain of the now-hated person he's trying to rob the job of — those are the things that matter. You can forget about making the country a better place.

Larner's Academy Award winning screenplay hits all the right notes — not mean but wicked, funny, but not overtly so. It isn't a comedy as much as it is a drama that realizes how ridiculous campaigning is, and it cackles along with McKay's increasing concerns. There is a great little scene that finds McKay in the back of a limo, reciting old lines from previous speeches. But after each sound bite he makes a sound of disgust, whether it be a gag, a cough, or a scoff. The sequence is subtle, yet it speaks volumes; have we gotten to a point in our election process where a particular quote, a particular fragment of a speech, matters more than the overall goal of a candidate?

The film also contains one of Redford's finest performances, capturing his distinctly everyman appeal while heightening the sly humor he can easily project just by uttering a single line. He is the kind of actor that can deliver a line like ""We don't have sh-t in common"" and still remain likable; he is the kind of actor that can look unfazed by the presence of a cameoing Natalie Wood and not seem like a complete jerk. In ""The Candidate"", we don't necessarily identify with him. Instead, we jump onto his back as he maneuvers through the jangling dishonesty of the election process.

Here is a movie more interested in saying something than showcasing how great its actors are, how great its direction is. ""The Candidate"" doesn't move you; it causes you to think. And as the race for the presidency continually heats up these days, it is compelling viewing that has hardly aged in what it has to say.",7.0,16 June 2015
Best political film ever made,"I saw this film in 1972 when it came out, and I just saw it again on cable. I am amazed at how prescient this film was. Remember, this was before Jerry Brown, the real life politician most people will think of as a counterpart to Redford's character, had not yet run for governor and was still unknown outside of California. Nixon was still in office and was about to be re-elected by a landslide. Abortion was still illegal in all 50 states, and Roe v. Wade had not yet been decided. The term ""sound bite"" had not yet been coined. ""Spin"" was something a washing machine did.

Redford plays an idealistic young storefront lawyer who is persuaded to run for the Senate as a Democrat against a Republican incumbent running for his fourth term. He feels free to speak his mind because he knows he hasn't a chance of winning. His freshness and honesty win over a lot of people favorable to his politics, and suddenly the gap closes. Now he has a chance of winning, but to do so he has to win over the ""undecided voters"" in the middle of the political spectrum. (Sound familiar? I'm writing this nine days before the Bush-Kerry election, and no one knows who will win.) Guess what happens? Suddenly he's not so fresh and honest anymore. And by the time he finally has a televised debate with the incumbent, he has mastered the art of the non-answer answer, that is, responding to a reporter's question by making a vague statement of his own without ever answering the question.

Fast forward to 2004. The spin doctors now run the show. This film was intended as satire and as a warning. Regrettably, it has become a prediction. 10/10",10.0,24 October 2004
A must for cynics,"Robert Redford, the idealistic son of a former party machine governor, gets encouraged into running for the U.S. Senate by a coterie of professional handlers. Fascinating film, alternately satiric, cynical, subtle, and ironic. Shot mostly in a documentary style. A must for cynics and/or political junkies; others won't care. A good performance by Redford is complimented by fine work by Boyle and Garfield. Douglas is also great as the candidate's father. One of filmdom's classic closing lines. 2 stars of 4 on a tough scale.",6.0,1 November 1999
The Candidate,"Robert Redford, in one of his unjustly overlooked films from 1972, stars as a lawyer and the son of the former governor of the state of California in an election year where the senatorial incumbent has no competition. Peter Boyle convinces Redford to run, fully expecting and anticipating to lose, therefore being able to run on a platform of pure integrity to show how out of touch the current senator has become. But suddenly the public realizes that some fresh, younger blood with an idealistic eye might be what they truly want rather than another in a long succession of terms by the same old huckster. Melvyn Douglas also stars as Redford's father. Even though this film is almost 30 years old, the Oscar-winning screenplay by Jeremy Larner shows just how timeless the same old issues the candidate has to decide where he stands upon (abortion, the environment, health care) actually are. The script really is eye-opening, because it underlines very well the point that even if, say, Jesus Christ were to run for office today, what He would say is not as important as how and when He'd say it. Directed by Michael Ritchie (Smile, The Bad News Bears, Semi-Tough), one of the few American directors who has been able to successfully show the black humor of the strange, fetid underbelly of competition in this society. Blink and you'll miss Natalie Wood at a fund-raiser. Completely climatized to the Seventies, she looks like Donovan's aide-de-camp.",10.0,22 March 2000
Superb political tale...some issues and tactics never change,,7.0,22 August 2012
The timeless definitive campaign,"This is a truly excellent and overlooked Redford vehicle, and his performance comes full circle. From wide-eyed idealism to resigned cynicism, all the way back to little-boy-lost and overwhelmed. Redford is flawless! Peter Boyle is right-on as the experienced campaign hand. Also it is easy to overlook Don Porter's effortless portrayal of the smooth and experienced incumbent senator, just on the verge of decline. Porter's seamless delivery makes it look easy.

Douglas is also excellent as John J. McKay, Redford's father and the former governor. Obviously a traditional machine politician, and apparently estranged from his activist son for that, and perhaps for other reasons we are left to imagine, Douglas revels in the younger man's initiation to the corrupt world of politics. Catch the hunting scene to illustrate how these two are poles apart.

An intelligent, realistic, and rewarding film about politics, done at a time when folks were perhaps looking for a political fairy tale.",9.0,24 June 2001

almost too real to be true,"This is a film about how power, or its possibility, corrupts. Redford is fantastically subtle, and the film itself feels like a documentary which gives you an inside look into the whole process of 20th century ( and unfortunately 21st also) politics.

In the meanders of an electoral campaign,"This movie gives us a realistic and intense picture of an electoral campaign for the U.S. Senate in all its details, compromises and tricks. It's not brilliant but still good enough. However its weakest part is the main character himself. Glamorous Robert Redford was not the best choice for the role of a sincere and honest politician who tries to make a clean campaign based on the real important political, economical and social issues and who abhors simple propaganda discussions and speeches. The result is that the character he performs appears as not as deep as it should be and not very convincing in his performance as a campaigner. But it is a well made movie after all in terms of images (almost in a documentary style) and the screen-play is rather good and interesting.",7.0,26 May 2006

The Candidate,"Michael Ritchie directed Robert Redford and Peter Boyle in his 1972 film, The Candidate. The Candidate follows Bill McKay, an everyman who was pushed into politics to dethrone the incumbent senator who many believe has turned his back on the people and is too interested in power. A film that looks a lot like real life, it is difficult to discern whether or not life has imitated art, or the opposite has taken place, either way, The Candidate is a familiar story and one that is a little difficult to visit given the current state of American politics.

Bill McKay (Robert Redford) is a man who is more than happy to continue his quiet life submerged in his civil rights centered law practice. Bill has no interest in entering politics, as his father before him, former California Governor John J. McKay. Strategist Marvin Lucas (Peter Boyle) sees Bill as a unique opportunity, he sees the possibility of Bill entering a senate race against an incumbent Senator Crocker Jarmon (Don Porter) who has left his constituents disenfranchised as he seems to chase political power for his own gain. Marcus builds Bill's campaign using an interesting strategy; he has convinced Bill that he has no chance at beating the Senator, but will surely win his party's nomination, so, since he has no chance of winning, he can say whatever he wants and is free to shake up the political system on his way to defeat. The plans, however, go astray when the polls favor Bill much more than anyone ever anticipated.

The message of The Candidate is one that becomes diluted the more familiar it becomes. There have been innumerable amounts of ""everymen and everywomen"" running for elected office and winning that The Candidate, as a pseudo-documentary style film has lost its effectiveness. Certainly, most notably, the election of Donald Trump in 2016, proves without a doubt, that anyone with no political experience can achieve even the highest office in the land. The Candidate ""worked"" much better at the time it was made, when career politicians were the only ones getting elected office. Robert Redford feels a bit miscast in the lead role that commands a relatable, emotion-filled performance. In many of his scenes, he comes off paper-thin, definitely lacking emotion. Peter Boyle, on the other hand, plays his hopeful, yet controlled reckless attitude incredibly well. Boyle is an actor in which I have never sought out, yet been constantly impressed with every time I've seen his performances. Overall, The Campaign is a good enough film, but one that I wish I could have seen some 30 years prior when it still carried the crux of its relevance.",6.0,21 November 2016
"Like they say, it's all about politics.","Robert Redford plays idealistic senate candidate Bill McKay. He's mainly running to bring certain political issues into the open, although he never actually plans to win. But as time goes by, he realizes that whether or not he wins, he might not be able to hold on to his values.

""The Candidate"" is one of the many great movies about the world of politics. It holds up as well today as it did in 1972 (maybe even better). Redford gives a solid performance, as does Peter Boyle as campaign manager Marvin Lucas. One of the most insightful scenes is the debate between McKay and his opponent about the issues. A great movie in every way. Look for appearances by Natalie Wood, Groucho Marx, and Howard K. Smith.",10.0,5 December 2005
"Pungent, observant and trendy...","Robert Redford is in excellent form as a lawyer and idealist persuaded to join campaign for the US Senate on the Democratic ticket as an automatic underdog; however, his off-the-cuff appeal manages to reach a great many more voters than first anticipated. Fascinating glimpse into the election process, with fashionably quizzical ""what now?"" finale. Acerbic direction from Michael Ritchie, who sees the appeal in the material and never clutters up the scenario. Ritchie also gets fine supporting performances from Melvyn Douglas, Peter Boyle and Don Porter. Jeremy Larner's solid original screenplay won an Oscar, though Ritchie and his editors spike the narrative a great deal with their prickly handling. Two Oscars nominations in all, including Best Sound; Larner also won the WGA award for Best Drama Written for the Screen. **1/2 from ****",6.0,20 February 2008
One of the best political movies,"Political scientists and political film buffs need to watch The Candidate. It's one of the greatest classic political films ever made. I've studied dozens of political campaigns, conducted mock elections during my undergraduate and graduate courses, and volunteered for real campaigns when I was old enough. This movie is very realistic; the only other film that comes close in realism is 2015's Our Brand is Crisis.

Peter Boyle is a Democrat campaign manager, and in the California Senate election, the Republican sitting senator Don Crocker is a shoe-in. Whoever the Democrat candidate is doesn't stand a chance, so no one wants to ruin their career that way. Boyle approaches Robert Redford, the son of former Californian governor Melvyn Douglas. He's handsome, charismatic, and has name recognition—but he's a guaranteed loss so there's no consequence to anything he says or does. With the freedom to run as an honest politician, he becomes a very interesting and alluring candidate.

Even though the movie is about an election, it doesn't take too much of a stand about which party is right and which is wrong. Yes, it's the 1970s and Robert Redford is the lead, so there will be some environmental and ""look out for the little guy"" messages, but mostly, the film comments on the politics in general. It's really funny and sarcastic in the nicest way possible, and it has one of the most memorable last lines ever!",9.0,25 September 2017

7 on a scale of 10,"I like Robert Redford quite a bit as an actor. I especially like him in anything political. His run for senate as a nobody has the makings for a great movie. Great, it wasn't.

I found it entertaining, however, it seemed slow and at times boring. In fact, I wasn't impressed with Redford as much as usual. Most of the rest of the cast was just filler.

One problem I had was that the movie fails to explain in any meaningful way how Redford continues to close the gap to his opponent. Surely good looks isn't going to get you from 32% to over 50%.

Overall, I wouldn't even waste a minute on this movie, but any political movie with Redford as a star has got a big advantage up front. You default to liking it and you only change your mind if there are serious problems. There weren't any serious problems, but I have seen Redford in many better movies - Sneakers, The Natural, All the President's Men, Three Days of the Condor and The Sting, for example.",7.0,23 October 2004

About as relevant as the hula hoop,"Michael Ritchie's 1972 The Candidate is a sharp satire about a good looking and idealistic young lawyer who becomes compromised by political handlers that are more interested in images than issues. The film contains one of Robert Redford's best performances as Bill McKay, a labor and environmental activist lawyer who is the son of former Governor John McKay (Melvyn Douglas). Although Ritchie is even handed in allotting blame to both the candidate and the system for the eventual outcome, the implication is strong that the pursuit of political power in today's America is inherently flawed.

Marvin Lucas (Peter Boyle) is a savvy political boss who is looking for a candidate to oppose long time Republican incumbent Crocker Jarman (Don Porter). He approaches McKay, telling him that, though he will probably lose, he will have a platform in which to speak his mind. McKay accepts but stumbles right from the start, being upstaged by the overly aggressive Republican incumbent at a fire in Malibu and in speaking to an almost empty audience in central California. McKay says the right things but his platform manner is halting and unfocused and he lacks a coherent message.

When Lucas notices a slight uptick in his poll numbers, however, he hires Allen Garfield, a media specialist who transforms the campaign into an exercise in image making and slogans such as ""McKay: The Better Way."" Though McKay has his heart in the right place, he defers to his strategists and begins to tone down his rhetoric about abortions and school busing and learns how to play the game. The film even hints that he is not above seducing young campaign workers in a hotel room. With his son's prospects increasing by the day and impressed by Bill's debate performance against Jarman, his estranged father comes out to support him, even arranging for a deal to give political favors to a Teamsters boss in return for the delivery of a large number of blue-collar votes.

McKay ends up being a packaged candidate spouting liberal rhetoric without any substance or style. Compromise and manipulation is the order of the day. Written by Jeremy Larner, a former speech writer for Senator Eugene McCarthy, The Candidate delivers some funny moments such as McKay cracking up in laughter before a television camera and a memorable scene in which he spouts platitudinous nonsense in the back seat of his car on the way to a rally. Unfortunately, now that the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign has shown that victory and integrity do not have to be mutually exclusive, The Candidate seems about as relevant as a hula hoop. Even against long odds, the Senate seat in California is one of the most sought after prizes. Potential nominees campaign for years to achieve name recognition in the largest state in the country.

Even then, no one undertakes running for the Senate without previously amassing a sizable amount of money, support from labor and key interest groups, and an understanding that the huge media market requires professional advertising and marketing. Ritchie has a political boss calling the shots, ignoring the fact that California, because of the work of the California Democratic Council in supporting grass roots participation in the selection of candidates, was free of political bossism at the time. While The Candidate may once have had some relevance, today it comes across as irrelevant. Ritchie's cynical attempt to demonstrate why ""politics is b.s."" only succeeds in showing that the film's premise is b.s.",6.0,9 November 2008
Timeless political comedy with bite.,"Unobtrusive, documentary-style direction by the underrated Michael Ritchie lends verisimilitude to Jeremy Larner's witty (Oscar-winning) script. It feels like you're really on the campaign trail with a ""pretty-boy"" senatorial candidate (played with typically effortless charm by Robert Redford), who can barely keep up with a platform being built on the fly and the relentless media blitz that dogs him every step. Events move swiftly to their inevitable, ironic conclusion, highlighted by one of the best closing lines in cinema history.

Terrific support is provided by character actors Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Melvyn Douglas and others, plus a host of cameos by real politicians of the era such as Alan Cranston and Hubert Humphrey. If you want an idea how modern American politics works, this is still a pretty good primer.",9.0,25 October 2002

It's alright,"It was Election Day here in Australia today, and this was a politics-related movie that's been in my watchlist for a while, so I thought today was as good a time as any to watch it. I guess it also turns 50 this year, which might be another good reason to give it a watch.

In some ways, it's aged pretty well. It shows how much of a game politics can be, and how empty it can be, too, when you consider that one person really can't change a whole lot, no matter how much you might believe they can (or how well they convince you as a voter that they can). Redford is good in the role as the young up and coming politician running for Senate, and his performance is probably the best part of the movie.

I think it's a little lacking by modern standards when it comes to entertainment value. The satire just isn't quite biting enough, and despite it mostly feeling like a comedy, I didn't find it particularly funny. It might well have had more of an impact when it came out, when the ideas it put forward felt more novel. As it stands, I didn't feel particularly engaged once the film reached its final 40-50 minutes, in all honesty.

Still, even if it's not hugely funny or entertaining, it does hold up as a decent movie, and it makes a few good points while having another solid performance for the always reliable Robert Redford. For those aspects alone, it's definitely not bad.",6.0,21 May 2022
Timeless,"Hard to believe a movie about the American political system that was made 34 years ago remains so relevant.

The opening premise of the movie could be taken from today's headlines. Democratic party operatives need a candidate to run against a popular long-term, Republican Senate incumbent in California. OK, a conservative Republican would not be so popular in California nowadays, but substitute another state and you get the idea.

The Democrats do not expect to win, just to get a candidate to make a good enough showing so that the Republicans are forced to spend money here to defend the seat. There not being any strong Democratic candidates willing to go against this senator, the party operatives recruit a candidate based on his family name and physical appearance.

Robert Reford's character, Bill McKay, is an idealistic public interest lawyer in San Diego who wants nothing of the machine politics that made his father governor of California a generation earlier. Peter Boyle's party insider character appeals to the younger McKay by promising that he will not have to compromise his ideals, and can run on the issues he believes are relevant simply, because they have nothing to lose as the election is already lost anyway.

The story unfolds when Bill McKay needs to ramp up his campaign just to get to the point where his candidacy is credible. Once the campaign gets credible, the political machinery takes over and the ideals suffer.

Other than how little the making of political candidates differs from today, it's amazing to see issues being debated in 1972 that are still part of the debate today (abortion, race, crime, environment, health care, etc.). Very little is said about Vietnam, which is surprising, but to have a movie that names the political parties and addresses real issues in the manner politicians from the respective parties would, shows a boldness no studio would touch nowadays (i.e. Joan Allen's ""pro-choice Republican"" in The Contender being named vice president by a Democrat, yeah, like that would happen).

You'll Be Bored,"Maybe because I'm 18 and my favorite movie is ""Armageddon"",or maybe because this film is awfully dull,or most likey both; But what I do know is that this film didn't hold my interest at all...They could of made a political movie just interesting enough to hold my attension until the end,which they didn't.

The ending,which is supposed to be ironic,was very inconclusive.But it didn't matter.This is a dull,dull movie.No matter what political messages they tried to convey or whatever story they told,it just doesn't work because it's boring,and there's no getting around it!

And I thought ""Spy Game"" was the most dull Robert Redford movie.

1 1/2 stars out of 4.",2.0,1 May 2002
The Shaping of a Political Candidate,"""The Candidate"" is very insightful, very conscientious, and very accurate in exploring the trials, tribulations, and developments in transforming a nihilistic underdog into a popular, contending candidate for the California Senate. It is a good, provocative, and even satiric look at the ups and downs of the political landscape, as well as its many constraints, with political advisers not interested in the candidate's candidness, but rather sealing an election, and this is very fascinatingly and simply laid out in a film that goes ""the full monty"" in exploring the American political landscape- this is generally a behind-the-scenes development of the political process- from the frequent campaign rallies, to the luncheons and parades, to the advantage of incumbency, to dirty campaign tricks, to critical debates, and finally, to the anxiety, tension, and exasperation of the election. Robert Redford is the character study, playing an aspiring, yet hardly hopeful, son of a former California governor, dashing and articulate candidate for California Senate, Bill McKay, for the Democratic party. His challenger is incumbent Senator Crocker Jarmon, who seems to be the antithesis of all of the charisma, articulation, and humbleness that is McKay, a rather arrogant, prudent, and unappealing candidate, regardless of whether you share his beliefs. I have to wonder- is the film taking jabs at the Republican party- claiming it is apathetic, self-serving, and shadowy, while in contrast the Democratic party cares passionately about the people, contains darling appeal, and considers a ""better way"" for the people rather than simply winning an election. Perhaps I am finding ways to detract from some clear and distinguished differences between McKay and Jarmon, because of their parties in the film, and perhaps this is because I believe BOTH parties stand for the people, regardless of my political allegiances- whatever; just a curious observation. Robert Redford plays McKay very well and earnestly- really bringing this vivacious and whimsical character to life and shining on the ""campaign trail"". The screenplay is absolutely brilliant- taking every idea about politics and ingeniously infusing it throughout the many events of the film: a very constructive and admirable endeavor indeed. The music is very patriotic, sentimental, and portentous, really defining the American political spirit, and really pounding on a theme of greatness through victory. This is an extremely well crafted, well scripted, well acted, well directed, and well received, albeit very predictable and incisive, film, exploring the political landscape as verily as I have ever seen a film endeavor in. It's simple, entertaining, and contains some solid education about the shaping of a political candidate, through a hostile, volatile, and demanding political campaign- ""The Candidate"" is a real winner. ***1/2 out of ****",,10 November 2004
Movie about politics and the price of political ambition,"""The Candidate"" have a vital script with an ambiguous ending (with no clear political agenda) and a great cast. Redford as idealist lawyer Bill McKay is perfect in the title role because, here, he definitely has the star power, charm and genuineness to embody the role of the crusading liberal candidate who at the end losing his soul. But at the same time, the story of ""The Candidate"" isn't about McKay at all - a well intentioned empty suit - as it is about the people in the shadows who manage the politicians. Movie actually showing a lot of details about the political process that are relevant event today (2019). No matter the film unavoidably shows its age, it could easily be remade with the same script and stay just as relevant, what is kind of a bummer because it was made in the 70s of last century. As much as I did like its witty script it runs a bit long (at 110 minutes) and the director lacks in his definition of people - McKay is too charming, too nice, his rival Senator Crocker Jarmon too much a villain. The supporters of one are attractive, supporters of the other not attractive and that is why role of 'Senator' who was originally offered to James Stewart, was turned down by him because he felt it was derogatory towards conservative politicians, which is true to be told, usually true in Hollywood movies.

A who's who of 1970s politics,"One of the best movies about politics EVER.

One of the really cool things about this movie is the list of cameo appearances. Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern, John Tunney, Gene Washington, Cedric Hardman, Van Amburg, and other notables from California Democratic politics circa 1972 are all in here.

George McGovern reputedly hated this movie. Remember that he was the Democratic nominee for president in 1972. When asked about ""The Candidate"", he said ""I didn't like it, I thought it reflects the darkest side of American politics"".

Redford is amazing in this film, as an idealistic young lawyer torn between principle and ambition. Definitely one of the greatest actors of our time.",10.0,18 November 2007
Political cynicism at it's best,"If you ever wanted proof that the fundamentals of politics don't really change regardless of the decade then you only have to watch The Candidate.

This is The story of Bill McKay who is persuaded to run for the Senate against an apparently unassailable incumbent. It's agreed he can handle it his own way, on his own terms. But once he's in the race and his prospects begin to improve, the deal starts to change.

This is described as a comedy but it didn't feel like one . It's filmed very much like a documentary ( in 41 days) and you get the impression there wasn't much editing done because it definitely feels raw and perhaps that is what makes it the film it is ?

It's a movie about principles and how it's almost impossible to stick to them if you want to climb that greasy poll .

Redford is excellent as usual and is totally convincing as the new politician on the block . Put it this was , I'd vote for him !

If politics isn't your thing then I'm not sure this will be , but it's political cynicism cleared the way for the likes of The West Wing and The Thick of it and thank you for that.",8.0,11 April 2020
Becomes a classic through the years,"Having just watched this movie again, I realize with despair that it STILL has something valid to say, 33 years later! I think I would have really liked this movie in 1972, I certainly loved it a few years later when I saw it for the first time, but now it seems like an enduring classic. It is shot like a campaign is run - you feel the crushing emptiness of a political campaign, and Redford's frustration with being unable to raise actual issues is palpable. He is a contender mainly because of his looks (and family ties), not because of his beliefs. He has to boil them down to sound bites (not a term in 1972, I don't think) and then give some of them up altogether, all in order to win. The 'voters' don't come off too well, either - they seem like either groupies (young girls or older country club ladies) or disaffected losers. This should be shown in every 8th grade civics class!",10.0,24 March 2005

The Game And How It's Played,"Young Robert Redford, son of a former California Governor Melvyn Douglas, is a storefront lawyer devoting his time and talent to those who need his services. Coming from the well to do, Redford can afford it. A couple of sharp eyed political operatives, Peter Boyle and Allen Garfield, spot him the way Paul Krichell must have spotted Lou Gehrig out at Columbia University and scout him like you would a prized first baseman. A man with no public record and some name recognition, he might be just the guy to defeat three term conservative senator Don Porter.

Redford takes a chance and wins the primary and then he's the candidate against Porter. But he slips more and more into the hands of Boyle and Garfield in order to win. In the end he takes the road not taken by Spencer Tracy in State of the Union.

In many ways this might have been the easiest bit of casting for Robert Redford in his career. His positions as candidate Redford are in no way different than those of citizen Redford away from the movie set. Redford's certainly given enough of his time and treasure to candidates and causes he believes in. I'm willing to bet he's been opportuned many times to go into politics himself and he knows the game and how it's played.

That's what The Candidate is really about, the game and how it's played. Back in the days of the founding of America, the biggest media outlet was the printed word. The political parties of the time, the Federalists and Jeffersonian Democrat-Republicans, had rival newspapers that slung some pretty nasty invective back and forth at each other and the print media held sway for over 150 years. Then radio and then network television supplanted the other and victory went to those who mastered those media. That's what Boyle and Garfield are, spin doctors who know how to use the most advanced communication form of the day. If The Candidate is ever remade the characters of Boyle and Garfield will be those who use cable television and the internet.

My favorite player in The Candidate however is Don Porter as United States Senator Crocker Jarman. Porter modeled his performance clearly on the current Governor of California Ronald Reagan who certainly mastered the media of his day. I think Crocker Jarman was probably Don Porter's career role and should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor.

Dated though it is because of the advent of cable and the internet, The Candidate if a prime candidate for a remake. Can you see Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio as Bill McKay talking about finding that better way and not quite sure what it is?",9.0,12 November 2006
the more things change...,"Jeremy Larner's brilliant, behind-the-scenes look at a modern political campaign and the marketing experts who make them work stars Robert Redford as an anti-politics California liberal reluctantly drawn into a race for the U.S. Senate with the naive hope of actually making a difference. He discovers, too late, that government isn't about issues or representation, but about exposure and packaging, marching bands and American flags; in other words, all the empty flotsam which, years later, now seems to mark the entire political process. The early '70s fashions are badly dated, but the film itself is more incisive than ever, showing how campaign attitudes, and sometimes even the actual speeches, haven't changed at all since 1972. Director Michael Ritchie reinforces the near-documentary authenticity by enlisting celebrities to portray themselves, from Natalie Wood to Mike Wallace. In 1988 the film was named by then Vice Presidential candidate Dan Quayle as a career influence, despite his obviously having missed the point of it entirely.",8.0,9 November 2010

"Great film, great screenplay and great actors !","This film is a masterpiece in lots of ways. First of all excellent screenplay and an amazing supporting cast (Allen Garfield as Redford's ad man and Melvyn Douglas as Redford's father). Robert Redford plays Bill Mc Kay a young lawyer, son of Governor John J. McKay who becomes a candidate for senator. Mc Kay is very sympathetic and handsome too. Robert Redford is really incredible in this film, as an idealistic young lawyer torn between principle and ambition. Bob is definitely one of the talented actors of our time. This film has also a timeless message and should be shown before every election. What is also really very interesting in this film is how Bill Mc Kay evolves and how the political machine changes him. Finally we realize particularly at the end that he's no different from Crocker Jarmon his opponent (the debate scene is brilliantly performed by both actors Robert Redford and Don Porter).Indeed, what Bill Mc Kay stands for, his priorities, his principles will be sacrificed just to get elected as he realizes that he can win.

NICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT...,"No matter the age of this film, it's interesting to watch the cycle of politics, fact or fiction. Basically, Robert Redford plays the new kid on the block, running for a senate seat, and more for name recognition, as he doesn't have a chance against a political dinosaur. Or does he?

If you're into politics, you've seen this story played out over and over again, which makes it all the more fascinating. I would categorize THE CANDIDATE as a casual look at ourselves and a cannibalistic animal called politics... and what feeds the beast.

An Oscar winning screenplay, and Redford is convincing, making this one ya' gotta' watch just to see how it all pans out. Cheers for veteran Melvyn Douglas as Redford's father. Hailed as one of the 10 best films of the year. Nominated also for Best Sound.

Cult Movies 12,"12. THE CANDIDATE (drama, 1972) Lawyer McKaye (Robert Redford) heads his own public law firm. He's an idealistic man who comes from a wealthy-political family. Marvin (Peter Boyle) heads a political committee looking for a 'young, fresh face'. Though McKaye hates the political arena, Lucas convinces tells him that he has nothing to lose and everything to gain. He accepts in the hope of bringing his ideals to bear. Instead, he is introduced to the subversive political world and the dark forces lurking beneath its echelons.

Critique: Serio-documentary, 'The Candidate' is one of those films that should be shown to students seeking a political career. Its precise depiction of a 'citizen' turned into a bureaucratic tool is almost too real.

Director Michael Ritche recreates the sometimes absurd, complicated and superficial world of political inner workings to perfection. Robert Redford is perfectly cast as 'wholesome', naive underdog-champion. You can almost feel a 'JFK-like' aura around him.

The film's innovative 'cinema-verite' scenes further reinforces the sense of a documentary. An excellently written, 'illuminating' experience.

The CANDIDate,"THE CANDIDATE is a fascinating piece of work. Viewed this week with MEDIUM COOL -- Which one poses the greater criticism of television? MEDIUM COOL soaks in faked realism, THE CANDIDATE does the same. But they are such different pictures. In the end, CANDIDATE ultimately forms a more electric and buzzing indictment of Communication Age politics and it does so at a predictably steep price.

CANDIDATE revels in a backstage, ""candid"" approach to political procedure. It harnesses a very active camera - moving, zooming, panning. Evidenced immediately in the credit soundtrack, this isn't meant to be a deft evaluation of Americana, it's a mockery. McKay has his sleeves pulled up, he's eating, he's unbuttoned, he's untucked, he's incorruptible. And the picture is presented as such a slick piece of entertainment that it's just about impossible to disagree. Here's the really interesting part. Whether or not CANDIDATE was aiming for it -- was it? -- it shows television as the most formidable political gamechanger in history. So many of the lines tailor to it -- ""they"" cut your hair. So many scenes are Television Training Camp. There's the self-satisfied shot where the camera pans into the viewfinder of the TV camera while McKay compromises on his crime policy. In essence, CANDIDATE demonstrates a radically different and devolved political landscape than earlier pieces. Is McKay a Jefferson Smith of the 70's? I think he is -- thanks to the script.

This celebrated script. It stacks Politicians against Non-Politicians and has Redford migrate from the former to the latter. And how it abuses Redford! Possibly the best thing about the film is Redford's amicability and his tangible love for filmmaking. Three years after Sundance, he is ready to be cool for the adults. But what about this script they hand him? The liberalism is so piquant that it smells like we would be better off without government. Like politics is somehow more corrupt or convoluted than anything else in the age of television. The one thing it gets right -- accidentally or not? -- is how the equation of celebrity and politics equals power. Towards the end, the script wallows so much in its own sagacity that it is enough to make me seasick. My biggest question is this -- is the ambitious and potent critique of television incidental or not? And another, how connected are Bill and Barack?

Jefferson. Bill. Barack. America evolves, doesn't it?

insightful writing and good performances,"Political operative Marvin Lucas (Peter Boyle) is looking for a Democratic candidate to oppose popular Republican U.S. Senator Crocker Jarmon in California. He convinces idealistic do-gooder lawyer Bill McKay (Robert Redford) to enter the race in an unwinable race. He offers him an opportunity to say whatever he wants. McKay is the son of former governor John J. McKay (Melvyn Douglas) and becomes the nominee. His campaign is being crushed by the Jarmon machine and he tries to water down his message. He struggles between the same politics as usual and his convictions as the race tightens.

The Watergate break-in happened and nobody cared. The public still has some blind naivety about the world of politics at the time. This movie skewers it with a bit of humor and lots of insight. The shooting style is slightly documentary style. Redford and Boyle are terrific. The writing digs deep and wins the Oscar. It's a great movie about the real political world.",8.0,28 January 2015
Political world...,,8.0,27 March 2009
Excellent movie about politics as usual,"This is essentially a story about a young, idealistic lawyer who happens to be the son of the former governor of California and who is tapped to run for the US Senate. Robert Redford does a terrific job in this movie as Bill McKay, the main character who starts out against the political system but eventually is turned into a polished, coached, trained politician once it looks like he has a chance to win the Senate seat. It's amazing how subtle the writers were trying to be here, and less observant viewers may not notice McKay's very gradual transformation from a regular guy who speaks his mind ""Every woman should have the right to an abortion"" to a slick, smooth-talking politician ""Abortion is something that we should study"". This story basically illustrates how most people get caught up in the mess that is Washington politics, and turn from young, idealistic people with noble intentions to sleazy, double-talking crooks whose only goal is to get elected or re-elected (the late Senator Paul Wellstone being an exception). The last line just goes to show that your average politician treats Election Night as if it is the end of everything, when in fact it is simply the beginning. A terrific movie, and I look forward to Redford's sequel. 10/10.",10.0,26 November 2002
Good movie - Food for thought.,"I saw the reviews of this movie and I figured I'd give it a shot. It lived up to expectations, but not in the way that I thought. I had rather expected a ""1970s Bulworth"". Someone who would hit hard, keep hitting hard and never let up, although not using rap to get the point across.

What I actually saw was a realistic story of an idealist's struggles with politics and publicity, as well as the effect on someone's family life. The ending made me stop and think for a while about how the struggle for change can be a tough row to hoe.

I would recommend this movie for anyone who wants to go into politics, since it's a realistic story of the pressures inherent in dealing with the pressures and the ""powers-that-be"" involved.",,16 January 2001
"Overrated, this one.","I've said it before and I'll say it again, good acting doesn't necessarily make a good movie. For me no matter the genre a good movie must be first and foremost satisfying, and in that sense this film did not deliver. Be a film sad, funny, deep or serious it must satisfy.

The editing for much of the film is all over the place. Yes, they are trying to convey the whole chaotic political primary thing, but instead I felt more a sense of a chaotic edit room and confused filmmaker.

For the first 15 minutes of the film I had no idea what was going on because the audio was so poorly recorded. This happened several times during the film too. People appeared to mumble key lines. What they said I had no idea. Yes, I get what the film was trying to do and how the viewer was to find a new keen sense of cynicism for the film provoked what cynicism they already had, but the director was at times meandering around not knowing where he was going. The film never really convinced the viewer the characters were anything more than their caricature.

Boyle's character got all the best material, and boy, he certainly didn't waste it. Good performance. Not enough to make me want to see the movie again, however. The movie had me thinking too much and not feeling enough.

I don't know, I wanted to like this one more and I stayed up late to finish it, but regret doing so. I reckon director Peter Weir would have taken this material much further and given it more what it needed. Don't ask me what they sound crew were up to. Probably the directors fault.

Good performances in an otherwise messy film that lacked a pointed focus and vision to drive the message home. The script needed much more work. That was probably what happened-trying to make a profound movie from a not so enlightening script.",4.0,23 November 2021
'For a better way - Bill McKay',"Robert Redford, reveling in his finest form (as in The Natural, ATPM, Brubaker & Indecent Proposal) is an idealistic young lawyer, who is sucked into the vacuum of politics - initially refusing to build up his profile by taking a free ride on the coat tails of his ex-senator father. American political films are common, but good ones are quite rare. This film falls into that latter category. Bill McKay agrees to run for Senate believing he can remain true to his values - honesty, realism, ideology, independence and a healthy distrust of policy for policy's sake. On that basis alone, he is an idiot, as the whole process predictably obscures his opinions, blunts his marriage and sees him struggle with compromise.

Mc Kay is rushed around town as the new kid on the block, taking in snatched TV slots, endorsement opportunities, talking with union workers and disenchanted youth along the way. However, 'The better way' is blocked at the outset by the sitting tenant, Crocker Jarmon (Don Porter). As a time-served Mr American and the holder of an office that he feels he deserves just for parking his butt on the seat of history, 'The Croc' is a magnificent enemy. Note the key scene where McKay simply loses patience in a TV head to head with Jarmon. A house of cards seems to fall around his ears and what does The Croc do? Easy - he makes capital out of it in his smug dignified 'I would never stoop so low' brand of schmultz. You gotta love that guy.

The final scene (even though you can guess the outcome of the plot) is a gripper. Mc Kay, among the chaos, manages to get a minute's privacy with Marvin, his overwhelmed agent, who has even combed his beard on the advice of his staff. He simply asks him 'What happens now?'. That left a chill with me when I first saw the film and, on a re-view, the impact is still just as strong. On that basis, 'The Candidate' has stood the test of time as the deep stink of party politics is as rancid as it ever was.

Michael Ritchie is not a director I know much of, aside from his previous Redford collaboration, Downhill Racer, which I thought was average. How nice to be proved wrong, therefore, as this film is definitely a director's badge of honour. It is also extremely well acted across the range. I understand there was talk of a sequel and it is a shame that it never materialized.",8.0,6 December 2003
"Great movie, hope they make a sequel some day!","I finally got to see this movie and I found it very charming.

Quick summary:

Redford plays a semi-serious lawyer Bill McKay whose father was once a governor for California. Now some want him to follow his father's footsteps and become a candidate for senator, but he has a tough rival and his attitude towards it all seems as if he doesn't want to do it, but does it anyway.

Redford is just great in this movie... and very cute! The ending is left just right fora sequel, which I wonder why they haven't made yet.

Excellent satire on the problems of modern politics,"While this film was made before the golden age of mud slinging politics, it accurately portrays the problems of the American electoral system in the age of television. As exciting as that sounds (sarcasm), this film actually keeps it interesting and never loses its sense of humor. Dynamic, fascinating characters, well acted by the likes of Redford, Peter Boyle and Melvyn Douglas (to name a few), deliver a slice of reality that is as ironic as it is fun to watch. No one is who they claim to be as we the audience are dragged into a world where everything is staged and carefully planned by a bunch of men in a smoke-filled room.

Since this film is a satire on politics circa 1972, many of the issues addressed in this film have actually gotten much worse. For instance the ""attack ads"" portrayed in this film are tame in comparison to todays standards. Also, a few of the political issues are a bit out of date. Aside from that, ""The Candidate"" 30 years later still holds up. Showing how even a man of deep convictions struggles with the insanity of political sound bytes, 30 sec. commercials, instant polls, theatrical televised debates and wishy-washy swing voters. After viewing this film, my optimism for the future of politics was damaged, as I realized how deep the problems that TV bring to the table actually are.

Excellent cinematography, acting and screenplay! I highly recommend this film for anyone who loves or hates politics. It goes right up there with Barry Levinson's ""Wag the Dog"", as a film that should be required viewing in high school government class.",9.0,31 March 2003
***1/2 star movie. Great film. One of Robert Redford's overlooked films,"This movie seems to have a great talent with documentary-style filming. It's so real that it's as if the filmmakers just let the cameras roll while Bill McKay was on a campaign run. However, this is not real. This involves Robert Redford in an overlooked performance as Bill McKay, an idealistic lawyer who runs for Senator of California to upset an old and creaky warhorse Senator named Crocker Jarmon (Who's really a Crock). This film takes you from the beginning when the idea comes about to the time of the debate (Which is one of the great climaxes of the film) to election night, to the results. If only electing a President in this country were this easy. Robert Redford makes his role the best that it could be. Here's a man that goes through so many parades, interviews and handshakes and yet he still has the same ideals that people love, want, and need. This is a great movie and is worth watching (Especially during a time of election). Michael Ritchie's documentary-style filming is exceptionally and tastefully well done and the rest of the cast (Including a few appearances by Melvyn Douglas) shines along with Redford.",,4 January 2001
Pretty boring,"I like a lot of Robert Redford's movies, and after reading some of the reviews I was looking forward to watching this. I thought the first half built to where it was going to be at least a good ending. That's where I would be wrong. There was no crescendo and it pretty much fell flat. I was hoping that at least during the debate something exciting what happened but it was dull dull dull.

In the movie ended and I pretty much thought, what a waste of what could have been a good movie.",4.0,17 July 2023

Peter Boyle plays a campaign adviser who wants to Robert Redford to challenge Porter. Redford is just a lawyer who isn't even registered to vote but is the son of the former Governor of California, played by Melvyn Douglas. Boyle tells Redford he has no chance of winning so he can basically say or do anything he wants on the campaign trail.

One of the best political movies of all time,"This is actually is a movie about politics and the message is that the system takes over from those who start out with good intentions. From a UK perspective it means more now (the year 2000) than it did when it was released because then it was a picture of where we were heading and now it speaks to where we are!

Soundbites, image and personalities take over from substance, especially as the candidate gets closer to victory. Only those who know they are going to lose can afford to be completely honest, is the message, and the closer you are to winning the more you are under the control of the party machine. As an independent local councillor in the UK I can personally testify to this.

The seventies hairstyles and clothes are unfortunate to the modern viewer but we still recognise the characters, the pressures and the motivations.

It was Much More Interesting, For Sure, During it's Initial Release (now this stuff is common everyday knowledge), But that Doesn't Mean that it is Irrelevant or Dated or Uninteresting.

The Perfect Casting of Robert Redford as an Idealist Lawyer with No Interest in Politics is Recruited to Run for U.S. Senator and Convinced to do so Because He is Told that He Can Get His Ideas Heard and in The End...""You Lose"".

Peter Boyle is Quite Good as the ""King Maker"" and the Media Machine Behind The Candidate is Convincingly Portrayed. In Fact the Whole Political Scene from the Early Seventies is Given Gravitas by the Screenplay Penned by Former Eugene McCarthy Speechwriter Jeremy Larner, and Received an Oscar for This Work.

Overall, it is a Bit Startling, but Maybe Not, that the Issues Presented in the Campaign are Still Debated and Divisive Today. Also, the Rules of the Game Haven't Changed That Much Either. The Preparation, the Concessions, the Presentation, the Do's and Don'ts are Pretty Much the Same Now as Forty Years Ago.

Entertaining Movie,"I just recently rewatched this film, it was entertaining, well written and well acted. Robert Redford was so handsome-perfect for this role. I laughted when Melvin Douglas who played his father and former Governor stated ""He will get a lot of votes. He's cute.""",10.0,20 August 2021
Great for political junkies and seasoned movie goers and still relevant,"For someone who became a star as a glamour boy, Robert Redford has been involved in many successful, serious roles and movie projects that speak to seasoned movie goers. We recall his early movies like Barefoot in the Park, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and The Sting. He then went on to make his mark in more serious movies like this one, Jeremiah Johnson and All the President's Men. He also directed the award-winning Ordinary People and many others throughout his career. The Candidate certainly resonated with this political junkie. Its quality, however, would impress many viewers. Redford as the Candidate and Peter Boyle as his campaign manager show how a young activist with star appeal and an accomplished political handler can achieve success, but at a price. Boyle lures him into a race for the Senate against an accomplished insider who has a huge lead in the polls. As time goes by, Redford becomes more self assured as he realizes being himself is a key to success because of his confidence and good looks. But the road to that success was not what the candidate wanted. In fact, he shunned the world of politics with its artificiality, compromise and broken promises. His father, superbly performed by longtime stalwart Melvyn Douglas, is a former governor who at first seems to distance himself from his activist son. Don Porter is Redford's opponent. He is shown as the stereotype of the Republican candidate that Democrats love to hate. Porter is a shrewd politician and Redford, as a newcomer, has his hands full. This movie had me excited as it moved along at a very quick pace. There were cameos by television broadcasters Howard K. Smith, humorist Art Buchwald, former Vice President Hubert Humphrey, etc. This and the styles and background of the 1970's give the movie added enjoyment. I was surprised, however, that the Vietnam War, which was still dragging on in 1972 was not mentioned once. The environmental movement was clearly becoming an issue and one that was dividing people, then as now. At a time when many young people were questioning politics as a profession, as they still are, this was a work that speaks volumes. It is a great movie and as relevant as ever.",8.0,18 February 2018
Snappy Political Film,"Jeremy Larner won the Best Original Story and Screenplay Oscar in 1972 for this snappy little film. It's all about how American politics is focused mostly on campaigning and very little about governing, a message that isn't groundbreaking but certainly hasn't lost relevance all these years later. Larner's screenplay and the performance of Robert Redford are the film's biggest selling points. At times, it feels a little like Robert Altman lite, with its busy soundtrack and constant on-screen bustle. If it never reaches the anarchic brilliance of Altman at his best, it's still a worthy contribution to the cynical and jaded political film genre that was so abundant in the 1970s.

The sound design caught the attention of the Academy too, and they nominated it in that category.

And am I the only one who thought that Karen Carlson, who plays Redford's wife, is a dead ringer for Annie Murphy in this movie?

Grade: A.",8.0,29 August 2022
No Longer a Satire,"As a nation We must face up to the facts that we'll be watching President Michael Jordan at his state of the nation in the near future. Therefore, I think it is time reclassify The Candidate, the quintessential political satire, as something more along the lines of historic fiction.

After all, what's satirical about an alleged maverick who rides a wave of good looks, charm and vacant promises into high office? Was I the only one in America who coughed up his fettucini when George W. Bush had the nerve to promise no new taxes, only new tax cuts? Am I the only one who remembers that even conservatives didn't care for his daddy? Satire is reality now. Mark Twain would be a realist now, not a humorist.

Which brings us back to The Candidate. Awesome. You have Redford (sideburns and all), the idealistic lawyer helping the migrant farmworkers down in San Diego. You have Peter Boyle as the old college chum who offers Redford a free platform in an election he can't win. Throw in Allan Garfield as a king-making campaign expert, and Melvyn Douglas as Redford's estranged father, a former Governor, and you got it all. The acting by these folks is excellent. The presence of many real reporters and journalists only adds to the realism.

You aren't five minutes into the campaign, and the sideburns are gone, the sell out begins. From the trenches down in San Diego, to the rich lady lunch-ins in Bel Air, sucking around for money and votes. So much for idealism. Natalie Wood shows up, as herself, and as you watch Redford chat with her, you'd swear it was Bubba Clinton. It's no surprise that writer Jeremy Larner and director Michael Ritchie are both veterans of the campaign trail. They understand it from the inside out.

A big reason this movie towers over most recent political films, is because it never feels canned. I really believe (Idealism alert!) that this film was made to teach, not simply to make a buck. Lately, when I watch most new political satire, or any new satire for that matter, I often feel cheated. I get the impression that I'm being pandered to, rather than enlightened. I'm too often reminded that I'm watching a Hollywood product, with the everpresent marketing logos sprinkled throughout, and the forced pop references. Satire is supposed to ridicule through irony. Films like The Candidate and Network don't wink at the audience. They play it straight down the line, heightening the absurdity of their subject, by keeping a straight face.

Treasure this movie. It's fast becoming a dinosaur. I can't imagine trying to write a satire on politics these days. Maybe that's why the more recent films don't quite measure up. Maybe it's not Hollywood, but the decrepit political system that ties the hands of the new breed of filmmakers. Maybe it isn't the money that kills filmmakers integrity, but simply the lack of good material to make a good satire. Maybe the last two lines I wrote were laced with satire!",10.0,7 February 2000

Great performances!,"Redford, Boyle, and Garfield were all fantastic in this movie! The story is solid and the script is good, but the directing and editing could have been a little better.",8.0,8 June 2021
Fascinating story of political ambition and eventual disenchantment.,"I really enjoyed ""The Candidate"" film. I'm not aware of every Robert Redford film but he is very good in this one. The story follows the political campaign of a man who wants to be elected the senator of California. As the character in question, Robert Redford is a Democratic as opposed to his opponent who is a Republican (Don Porter). The inital attempts to win the election aren't very successful, until Redford realises that he can't succeed on his own terms. Eventually, he experiences disenchantment by having to sacrifice his own principles for the sake of winning the election. I won't reveal anything about the ending but you have to see it in order to understand it. The writing is very good and it makes a refreshing change to see an American film from this era that is more thought-provoking than ones that are just violent. I enjoyed the scene with the political television debate, it becomes a bit heated at one stage!",8.0,26 June 2017
****,,10.0,20 July 2015
Excellent dry humor political satire that belongs up there with the greats,"What do Network, The Graduate, Chinatown, and The Candidate all have in common? Besides using an LA hotel as a set piece at least once, these 70s condemnations of corruption in both the news media and on Capitol Hill all give moments where mouthpieces for authenticity are chewed up and spat out by the overlords in control of them and end with scenes of the protagonist being told an ""It's Chinatown, Jake"" level quote by characters who have been around the block more than they have, and end with powerful final shots of characters looking listlessly into the distance radiating ""What do we do now"" energy. Bonus if the protagonist is a heartthrob who has an affair, drives back and forth California a lot, is almost done in by LA water shenanigans.

The Candidate combines the best aspects of all these movies to show the ugly of the most stately people, in a dryer than the LA river deadpan satire that effectively captures this period in 70s Cali in an almost documentarian fashion in a beautifully cinemotographed feature. The scene that uses the mic interference to get across his disorientation is 10/10 sound design.

It kept me entertained while being in its commitment to its satirical bit, only dropping the mask ever so slightly in the scene of McKay rehearsing his A Better Way speech in the car in a movie that almost bludgeons the audience with its irony.

Overall I am satisfied with how the movie progressed given the potential to really screw the pooch if it didn't know what it wanted to say about the corrupting influence of politics and how to do so uniquely and in a way that's worth watching. Fabulously acted Senator Jarmon in particular really perfected the monotone politician voice and Robert Redford was made for the role of well intentioned golden boy governors son public servant who loses his way.",,17 June 2021
Solid behind-the-scenes look at a political campaign,"Great look at a political campaign that remains timely despite it's age. Redford is good as the young, glamour-boy candidate, but Peter Boyle carries the movie as his campaign manager. Boyle's performance is Oscar-quality, one of my favorites of all-time. Look for Natalie Wood in a cameo, she's never looked better.",9.0,12 October 1999

"By moving slow, the films intimacy grows","I was drawn to The Candidate because of two prior viewings: All the Presidents Men and The Conversation. The former features Robert Redford and is arguably one of the greatest films of all time. The latter is a hidden gem (and hard to buy/view) but captures the brilliance of Allen Garfield. Both excel here.

The plot is predictable from the title, the delivery less so.

The film meanders at a walking pace and is without any real climaxes. This isn't a weakness per se as it allows you to appreciate the sheer quality of the acting. A political campaign is full of repetition - quoting the same sound bites, greeting the same people - and this film captures that in a way that allows you to grow a fondness of characters you disliked from the beginning. You grow into the movie as the Candidate himself grows into a contender.

That's the films masterstroke: slowing the pace to grow the intimacy.

Final word to Robert Redford himself. Without offering spoilers, there are scenes here where you don't know if they are outtakes or actual acting - and if the former, they it fools you as the latter. He is so in control of his role as Bill McKay you feel like you're a fly on the wall on the actual campaign trail. Non-fiction might be a suitable categorisation as The Candidate feels that close to the truth.",9.0,17 March 2024
Finessing the Down and Dirty,"Cynical young Bill McKay is encouraged to follow his father into politics by running for the Senate against smooth longtime incumbent Jarmon. Against his better judgment, the handsome McKay reluctantly complies.

All in all, the movie shows the road to corruption without the corruption. True, we see McKay (Redford) drawn into the momentum of his Senate campaign under pressures of a large and harried staff. We know his early ideals are being slowly overridden, but crucially we never see the backroom deals that seal a fall from grace. We do see deal-maker Starkey (Tobey) meeting the candidate at a crucial election stage, but what exactly is understood between them is left unseen. Thus this inside look at our political process shows the colorful pomp but without the fateful circumstance.

And show the political spectacle, the movie does, in spades. I don't know how they did the many crowd and rally scenes, but the numbers and enthusiasm are convincing as heck. It's an excellently produced and directed effort.

Redford low-keys it all the way through. As the candidate, he's hardly the effusive glad-hander, but then, with his youthful good looks, he doesn't need to be. It's really Peter Boyle as the savvy campaign manager who projects. We also get a good look at the hectic pace and foul-ups that big time campaigns are subject to. Thus, it's no wonder that McKay slowly succumbs to the pressures of the contest that yield the movie's famous last line.

However, as a down and dirty look at the deal-making so crucial to electoral success, the movie only implies but doesn't show. Instead, focus is limited to McKay's ""selling out"", despite what he knows about the dirty business and his own better instincts. Thus the upshot amounts to the graphic undoing of one man but not of the process as a whole. Still, it's a very watchable production with lessons even for today.",,16 November 2015
Frighteningly topical,"The great American tragedy - a man of great integrity, who knows precisely what ethical dangers await one in elected office, sets forth to commit goodness, but in the end becomes -- a politician.

A tremendous insightful film when first released, seen now just on the other side of Bulworth's ""threshold of a new millenium,"" one finds that the only changes after nearly thirty years are sideburn lengths and width of ties.",10.0,20 June 2000
"Ahead of its time, behind ours","Excellent movie that shows campaign politics fifty years ago. Redford jumped into character with gusto and made the movie worth watching all by himself. He is one of very few actors that could turn on the charm to JFK levels. Peter Boyle played the campaign manager in a way that must have been a revelation in its day. Don Porter played a Reagan era oponent competently, and that is the catch. Move forward fifty years and all the cynicism of Porter, and Redford too, turns quaint. In such a short time the whole political business has turned upside down, from cynic to grotesque. This movie could be remade and it could turn into a great movie; there is so much new material.",8.0,15 July 2023

Shallow and pointless,"This film tries to show how pointless and shallow politics is, by being pointless and shallow. It's amusing to see how nothing has changed in thirty years. But don't waste two hours on this film. Redford does better as a director than as an actor.",,17 February 2002
Robert Redford's First Out Of Character Film Results In Another Success,Robert Redford first tried to establish himself as a serious actor with his role as a lawyer who pursues a run for a senate office in this 1972 Warner Brothers release. He succeeds yet again even when he goes almost completely out of character. There's some comedy here but it's mostly a dramatic show as Redford's character gradually learns how politics really work. A career highlight that would serve as a basis for Redford's later dramatic successes.,,6 November 2002
Robert Redford excels in this political comedy,"Bill Mccay is prepositioned by a political analyst to stand against a Republican elective who is such a sure-shot guarantee that other established democrats are refusing to run against him. Mccay being young, handsome and idealistic is chosen to lessen the blow according to the analyst. Mccay enters the challenge hoping to impart his message to the masses- regardless of the outcome. Unfortunately, he is found to be too good and ends up winning the election. This is a great comedy drama in the political realm and Robert Redford is excellent as the handsome idealistic Mccay. The film has garnered much acclaim since release and if you enjoy a good political movie then the Candidate is a fine choice.",,26 July 2018
"Well-made, and more or less informative","A fine film about a young lawyer (Robert Redford) running for the senate, encouraged by an old college-friend-turned-campaign-manager (Peter Boyle). Redford is assured by him that he will lose against the Republican incumbent and that he can therefore be as honest as he wants in the campaign. As his popularity increases, however, and it looks as though he may in fact win, his managers are far more careful about what they will and will not allow him to say on the issues of the day.

The Candidate is very well made, with an excellent screenplay and supporting cast (particularly Allen Garfield as Redford's ad man and Melvyn Douglas as Redford's dad, a former governor of the state), but, probably because of Redford's own political views, the film doesn't go as far as it could in showing the corruption rampant in party politics. There is one scene in which Redford has a run-in with a Teamster boss, but it remains unresolved, and in the next scene Redford is more or less back to his old idealism. We know something happened, but we have no idea what.

Despite this, The Candidate is highly recommended.

Watch for familiar faces, including Senator Hubert Humphrey.",,25 March 2000
