    "reviewBody": "By far the worst Marvel movie so far, I am extremely disappointed. After the mess that Thor 4 was, I was hoping that Marvel learned its lesson, but it seems not. I am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office, that&apos;s what you get for ruining such a great character (I loved Cpt. Marvel from the comics).\n\nWhat makes it bad: \n* Action moves way too fast from one scene to another\n* No character improvement or growth by the end of the movie\n* Things just happen with no storytelling\n* Not serious enough, too childish for my taste\n* Too many goofy moments (singing, really? We&apos;ve come this low, Marvel?)\n* End scenes that try to set the context for next movies seem forced and unnecessary\n\n\nI also found two good things eventually: \n* I liked the villain and her story, sympathized with her a bit\n* At least the movie was not long.\n\n\nThese writers should never be hired again.",
