Filmmaking at its finest.,"A breathtaking display of realism, I'm in complete awe right now, Shoplifters tells a touching story that evokes so many emotions and it does it well, it's seemingly simple at first sight but it's so nuanced to a point where you'd find yourself expecting a certain ending, preferably happy, but this film sticks to realism and it dismantles the social norms with such grace to a point where it offers a new insight to a world unknown to most, where people long for family love and they're desperate to have someone to call family, I must admit that it made me tear up at certain times on account of the raw emotions it conveys. the acting here is marvelous, it's more of a team effort as every character completes another and ultimately form an arc that tells the story in a brilliant way. Shoplifters is a rare exercise of social realism, it gets its message across so elegantly, filmmaking at its finest.",9.0,17 February 2019

Subtle and nuanced,"For this stunning masterpiece Shoplifters, Hirokazu Koreeda should win the Academy Award for Best Director. It is unbelievable that the rather complicated characters and their relationships are depicted in just two hours. The approach is mild, understated, low-profile, subtle and nuanced. Much room, space and thought are left to the viewers. The direction is simply super smart.

The cinematography is extraordinary, with some surprising long shots, close-ups and beautiful shots from tight angles. The editing is speechless, connecting numerous scenes just seamlessly. Not a single minute is wasted, and the film is largely intense and arresting. Together with the brilliant performances from the ensemble cast, the result is a satisfying and deeply affecting drama on lower class in Japan.",,4 August 2018
"Thoughtful insight into eccentric lives, in a refreshingly non-Hollywood style","I'm putting down 8/10 for a ""rating"", but basically I have no idea how to put a movie like this numerically in comparison with just about any Hollywood effort. It really belongs on a different scale entirely. My wife and I are just back from seeing it at our local art-cinema theater and we liked it very much. Stylistically, for other recent movies it's close to ""Roma"" and also the American indie film ""Leave No Trace"" as bittersweet, unhurried explorations of quite real human beings working hard to survive.

""Shoplifters"" follows the lives of a makeshift ""family"" living in the underside of an unnamed Japanese city (the particular place isn't important). The adults scrape by with low-security, low-paid jobs, the grandma has a small pension income, and the kids are vagabonds. They get by in a crowded, ramshackle tenement and the two kids are busy picking up the techniques of petty shoplifting from the adults. We slowly learn that almost none of them are actually related; they've haphazardly chosen each other to live with in a framework a little outside the margins of normal society. All of them, in some way, have left or been taken out of abusive or dangerous previous relationships. Throughout their exploits, told by a long series of short vignette scenes, is that they indeed feel close bonds but that their ""family"" is built, not by blood, but by the constant kindness they show towards each other. They survive on the margins, but they love and are loved.

The second and much more subliminal big message I took away from this film was its ambience: it's quiet. Scenes that would -- in a Hollywood film -- predictably lead to shouting matches or displays of anger or confrontations with authority, *never* take that cheap overdramatized route here. When confronted with tough questions, the main characters answer reflectively and with spare honesty. Even out on the streets with traffic and lots of people around, it's quiet. What a change.

Toward the end of the film, the main characters are being patiently interviewed by social services staff in a series of magnetically powerful scenes. The ""family"" members' answers are often startling: ""Why were you teaching your son to shoplift?"" ""I ... didn't know anything else to teach him."" or: ""Didn't you take your grandma and threw her away?"" ""No. Someone else threw her away; we took her in."" or: ""The child belongs with her mother."" ""No. Giving birth doesn't make her a mother."" From small glimpses like this, a window opens into an entire world of human nature.",8.0,26 February 2019
"A heartwarming, cautionary tale",,8.0,16 February 2019
A thoughtful and provocative japanese film.,"A small family of small-scale thieves finds a lost girl on the outskirts of a cold street and decides to give her shelter.

Enter with this film waiting for a kind of family history with light teachings, however, I end up being a very special work full of sweet moments and at the same time provocative, with ideas and messages that challenge us about our true definition of family and trust. With a sad and melancholic narrative that makes us feel small moments of beauty and union, but little by little begins to reveal layer by layer on a more bittersweet and human truth.

Filmed in an excellent way with a cinematography designed to stay around the eyes of youngsters, with a soft and melancholic soundtrack that perfectly complements the scenes. The performances are fantastic from the entire cast, especially the children, who give a realistic and humane representation when it comes to their performances. The script is fantastic and human, teaching them a hard reality and difficult to grasp many times by our intangible minds, people who try to survive day by day through bad actions, but still try to keep their intentions pure and good.

A film quite unique, original and emotional, full of hard and sad moments that move us completely but eventually end up revealing a new truth different from what we believed, highly recommended without a doubt.",9.0,10 June 2019
"interesting, but not special.","This film provides a glimpse at a side of Japan we don't usually see on film. Yes, there is (petty) crime in Japan; yes, there are poor people in Japan; and yes, there is a welfare system in Japan. The impression of all is pristine and proper in Japan is dispelled, and we see a more realistic, human side of the culture. I'm not sure if the hype is what spoiled it for me, but I will say there are some very good performances here, but the story is nothing exceptional except for the fact that it's taking place in Japan.",6.0,30 August 2019
multi-generational poverty,"Greetings again from the darkness. We typically think of family as blood relatives, those affiliated by marriage or adoption, and those funky cousins (sometimes 'removed') that, according to the family tree, are supposedly related to us. Expert Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda (LIKE FATHER LIKE SON, 2013) presents a story that will have you questioning whether the strongest connection is blood, heart, or money.

We first witness 'father' Osamu Shibata (played by Lily Franky) and adolescent 'son' Shota (Jyo Kairi) in a well-coordinated shoplifting maneuver at the local grocery store. On the way home they stumble across a shivering child, maybe 4 or 5 years old, who has been seemingly abandoned by her parents. They take her home to warm her up and feed her, and it's here we discover the multi-generational family living in a tiny apartment. This family also consists of 'grandmother' Hatsue (an excellent Kirin Kiki), 'mother/wife' Nobuyo (Sakura Ando), and teenage daughter Aki (rising star Mayu Matsuoka).

When the family discovers signs of abuse on the little girl Yuri (Miyu Sasaki), they decide to keep her - less an informal adoption than an admission to the club. See, this family lives in poverty, and finds comfort in working odd jobs and shoplifting. They do bad things out of necessity, in a kind of twisted 'honor among thieves'. Each person, regardless of age is expected to contribute to the team. The eldest provides a steady income through her deceased ex-husband's pension, and by scamming mercy money from his second family. Osamu and Nobuyo have regular part time jobs, while Aki works in a sexy chat room. Shota polishes his shoplifting skills and even tiny Yuri begins to learn by watching him. Everyone contributes in what can be described as a pyramid scheme of petty cons.

As the film progresses, we get to know each of the characters and begin to care about them ... rooting for them to find success. Writer-Director Kore-eda draws us in with subtle scenes of interaction between the characters, each willing to sacrifice for the other. He raises the question on whether choosing one's family might create a stronger bond than those blood ties. What really seems to matter is where we feel we belong, and where are accepted.

The film won the Palme d'Or at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, and it's likely due to the devastating and expert final act. In a dramatic shift in tone, true character is revealed - it's a shocking revelation on some fronts, and fully expected on others. Each family member has a backstory that slowly unfolds through the first two acts, and then abruptly slaps us upside the head as the film nears conclusion. There are many social aspects to be discussed after this one, including how the child welfare system (seemingly regardless of country) sometimes works against a child's best interest, even with the best intentions. This is one that will grab your heart and then stick with you for a while.",8.0,4 January 2019
Not exactly enjoyable...but very thought-provoking.,"Hirokazu Koreeda made one of my favorite Japanese films...""Like Father Like Son"". The focus on the film was what actually constitutes a family....and like this film, ""Shoplifters"" challenges the traditional Japanese notion of what makes a family and the importance of genetics.

This movie is NOT pleasant...and has many harsh moments. So, please consider this when you decide whether or not to see the movie. It's NOT an easy film to watch and if you are depressed already consider seeing a comedy instead.

The story is about a group of people who are a pseudo-family. They are not related but live as a family...with a grandmother, parents, sister and children...or at least folks who act like these roles. Why are they living as a family? Well, for mutual profit...and the children help pay the bills by spending their days stealing...much like the children who worked for Fagan in ""Oliver Twist"". Where does all this and the unpleasantness go? See the film.

The message of this film is unusual...that criminals like you see in the story MIGHT be better at parenting than the biological parents. It also exposes a truth you don't easily see when you are in Japan...that there ARE folks who fall through the cracks, so to speak, and are not productive citizens. I just returned from three weeks in Japan and evidence of the homeless and criminality of any kind is something you will have to struggle to find. It creates a portrait that challenges the cultural norms...something which some folks might not appreciate. Overall, a well made but very unpleasant film that deals with topics such as child abuse and neglect...not exactly fun subjects but ones which should not be ignored.",7.0,30 November 2018
Shoplifters Stole My Heart,"Sakura Andô is staggeringly beautiful, which would be distracting if she weren't such a great actress. She definitely stood out and that's tough for a movie with such great performances. I thoroughly enjoyed this and it was full of surprises, which I thought would be tough to do outside total twists or shock scares. Classifying this as ""crime, drama"" is inaccurate, but I get it. It's a drama, but it's so uplifting both the drama and the crimes are outshone by heart in this movie, and I say ""heart"" as a total misanthrope. This movie really touches you and shows you just how important human connection is to us, and not in a smarmy way, but rather in a way that highlights how that need for connection can be so easily assuaged and turn into genuine familial love.",10.0,14 February 2019
"Over-rated (yes, I know I'm an outilier on this one)","In Tokyo, a makeshift, impoverished family lives together in the home of one of its members, a pensioner. Three of the adults have low-paying jobs; one of them plus a boy of about ten partake in shoplifting to help meet family expenses. One night, the family takes in a homeless girl of about six, not yet knowing that she is from an abusive home.

Director/writer Hirokazu Kore-eda made a similar film in 2004: ""Nobody Knows"". Like ""Shoplifters"", ""Nobody Knows"" also delved courageously into the subject of children living poverty. While ""Shoplifters"" is one of 2018's most acclaimed films, I'm sadly an outlier on this one as I had mixed feelings about it though I did have a high opinion of ""Nobody Knows"".

There are many curiosities regarding the characters in their difficult circumstances: while the adults are good for taking in children from difficult homes, there is a strong question of morality in teaching them to steal. In normal economic circumstances, this is clearly wrong but is this still the case where economic survival is concerned? Even some shopkeepers seem to accept shoplifting as a way of life for some. More could have been explored here but this area, like others, seems to be at loose ends by the film's conclusion.

Kore-eda's directing style itself is ordinary even though the subject matter is not. The directing style could have been more impactful, perhaps like in the recent ""Roma"" where the ordinary was made fascinating. While the story and its characters are interesting enough, more is needed to justify the film's two-hour length - perhaps more characterization. ""Shoplifters"" also lacks a moral centre which is needed in a story that has so much moral ambiguity. Possibly, the moral centre is the young girl Yuri (a very affecting Yasu Hojo) if only for her total innocence in a very harsh world. - dbamateurcritic",6.0,16 February 2019
The Delusions of Shoplifters,"'Shoplifters' depicts a collective of social outcasts living in cramped quarters on the fringes of Tokyo, who survive by engaging in casual labor, petty crime and sex work. One cold night they take in the abused child of a neighboring couple, and subsequently adopt her into their merry band.

After this addition, the gang starts to consider itself a real family. Held together by an elderly matriarch, they live their outsider lifestyle in unrealistic harmony without much character development to compensate for the pedestrian narrative flow. The clan survives a major upset, but when a shoplifting caper goes wrong, the house of cards comes tumbling down. Secrets from previous lives are revealed, and the group's connecting threads become fragile as loyalties are stretched by altered circumstances.

'Shoplifters' has won some prestigious awards and got nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar, but it doesn't live up to its big reputation. Although it has the look of social realism, the movie is actually far closer to a fairy tale. At the end of the day it's fairly obvious why the Academy voters preferred 'Roma'.",5.0,19 March 2019
"Heart warming social realism, an instant modern classic","Watched in official En Competition at the Festival De Cannes 2018 on the 14th of May. My favourite film of the festival of the titles in competition films screened, all round excellent performances with deft direction, superbly written this film benefits from being written by a humanist director following in the steps of previous masters like De Sica and Bresson. I really cannot recommend this film highly enough, social realism that shakes you to your heart breaks, an instant modern classic. Ten out of ten.",,16 May 2018
Sometimes water can be thicker than blood,"Hirokazu Kore-eda's The Third Murder (2017) left me cold and entertaining the notion that Kore-eda has lost his mojo. O ye of little faith, please forgive me... Shoplifters, fresh from being minted with the highest honour, the Palme d'Or, at this year's Cannes Film Festival, is Kore-eda back to being his emotionally devastating best. This ranks in the top tier of his outstanding output. If ever there is a film that can declare that sometimes, just sometimes, water can be thicker than blood, this is it.

Somewhere in Tokyo, Osamu Shibata (Lily Franky), his 'wife' Nobuyo (Sakura Ando) and 'daughter' Aki (Mayu Matsuoka) live in poverty. While Osamu receives occasional employment and Nobuyo has a low-paying job, the family relies in large part on 'grandmother' Hatsue's pension. As he is shoplifting for groceries with his 'son', Shota (Kairi Jo), they discover Yuri (Miyu Sasaki), a neglected girl. Osamu takes her home, where the family observes evidence of abuse. Despite their strained finances, they informally adopt her.

Once in a long while, a film can come along, sneaks up on you and sends your heart into a flutter of tiny explosions. Coming out of the screening with six other friends, we had to dissect what we had just experienced. As it turned out, it wasn't much of a deconstruction, but more of a discussion of the ideas of the family unit that Kore-eda paints with such delicate and painterly brushstrokes. That's when you realise the immense power of cinema and what it can do. This is a gem.

Kore-eda dives into his favourite theme of the family unit and observes what will happen to the bedrock of familial relationships if it goes through a seismic shift. It is a theme he has dealt with in outstanding films like Nobody Knows (2004), Still Walking (2008), I Wish (2011), Like Father, Like Son (2013), Our Little Sister (2015) and After the Storm (2016). After so many excellent films on the same theme, you would think what else can he still distill. Shoplifters may be Kore-eda most complex, but yet his most accessible film to date.

The ideas explored in Shoplifters are multi-faceted and piercingly intelligent, intermeshed into a tapestry that will fall apart if even one scene is taken out. The script is subtle and draws empathy readily. So many times the dialogue feels innocuous, only for the poignancy to hit you in the gut some time later. It doesn't judge, never points a finger at any party, nothing here errs on the side of twee. The tone is deftly maintained from the first frame to the devastating last.

As usual, the heavy-lifting is done by the youngest actors, performances so naturalistic that they feel authentic. The ensemble is superbly cast and each of them shines in their own memorable way. They may be thieves, but there is honour and righteousness in them. They do not represent the lowest strata of the Japanese society and don't believe in handouts. With a warped sense of justice, they are willing to break the rules to survive. Above all else, their love and trust for each other is the glue that binds them.

Kore-eda never cheapens the emotional ride and doles out expositions like sermons. Details of characters are gradually accumulated in a Zen manner till it hits a gut-wrenching last act.

Like a lot of his heart-wrenching films, Shoplifters feels like a 3-hour magnum opus and I was again surprised it is only a 2-hour film because Kore-eda packs so much in the story. You will no doubt feel like you had lived a lifetime with the characters. Shoplifters is essential viewing and provides many involving examinations of what constitutes a true family. I love what the matriarch of the family said in a contemplative scene at the beach and I will paraphrase - ""Sometimes it is better to be with the family you choose rather than the family you are born in"". Some food for thought there.",10.0,17 October 2018
An Adorable Journey Throughout a Road of Humanity,"Academy Award's official entry from Japan Shoplifters already earned so many awards and could even got every awards if there was no 'Roma'. Shoplifters questions us and left us to find the answer. The question could be seen in the trailer too. It was ""Does giving birth automatically makes you a mother?"" Though shoplifters is not made on this very topic. It's more than this.

They are family with husband, wife, and grandma and with two kids. They are poor. The man named Osamu (Lily Franky) shoplift everyday with his kid named Shota (Jyo Kairi). They return home and feel their stomach with the foods along with the other members of the family. One day returning home Osamu and Shota found a little girl (Miyu Sasaki) was outside of his home who had no one in their family then. They took her into their little house full with humanity and everybody welcome her. On the next day they went to return her but ended up hearing their parents were fighting over her existence and that's why they decided to took her into their house.

All of them in this family earn legally or illegally. They are not all innocent but they do have innocence. This film is adorable with it's realistic family goals. No matter what this family is actually happy over anything they has. But will not they try to do something which is acceptable? They are helpless too. They are free, they enjoy their time. The little girl who used to get beaten by her parents made a great relationship with this family too.

First of all there is nothing to spoil this film. The trailer showed almost all of this movie. This film is made on the views over a poor japaneese family. Hirokazu wanted us to feel for them. And it worked amazingly by his artistically work. Shoplifters never gives you any hard moments and this film has no center conflict. It's like a flowing river that has some stones in the middle. Shoplifters is an adorable journey throughout an road of humanity.

Amazing screenplay form Hirokazu and masterclass acting from all the cast gave me goosebumps in moments. There are moments that can make you cry and laugh at the same time. Shoplifters will be always live with my heart. And I liked it by watching 8.1 on imdb over 17k votes. It is really good to see normal people started liking this kind of arts too.",9.0,23 February 2019
Great portrayal of ordinary folks' struggles and haunted pasts,"Excellently scripted and full of impressive subtleties, Shoplifters is a harrowing look at a working-class family in Tokyo, in the business of trying to simply make ends meet day by day. At first glance this may seem like just a story of this family resorting to petty crime, but as the plot gradually unfolds the reasons for the behaviour and decisions of each character is revealed, and al the dots begin to connect amidst this struggle.

Certainly seeing some of the characters getting involved in decidedly immoral behaviour- for example, the shoplifting carried out by the young boy and his father (as the title indications) and one young lady making a living off involvement in the porn industry, can be uncomfortable to see and it does present the characters in this film as morally dubious. But the whole situation that these people are in, and partially choose to create themselves, is eventually presented to the audience with unassuming subtlety, which is beautiful to watch. The overall tone of this film is fairly grim, and there is definitely raw emotional power to many scenes, but the acting and the script never at any point becomes overly sentimental or tragic. The scenarios and emotions that each character faces is really presented as it is, but of course with much delicacy.

This film may be relatively slow-paced and not visually stunning, but is breathtaking nonetheless. It's no wonder why it managed to win the Palme D'or! It's definitely going to end up as one of the best films of the year and will probably be recognised as a classic long in the future. Regardless of which culture you're from, I highly recommend checking this film out. It should deeply resonate with and impress any film lover.",9.0,6 July 2018

Could be the best work of Hirokazu Koreeda,"After filming several high-profile, slow-paced family dramas, the director Hirokazu Koreeda finally broke through the comfort zone he set up for himself in recent years.

"Sorry Film reviewers, I didn't like this movie",,6.0,1 January 2020
"Slow, without the payoff","I've had such a great run with well-received foreign language films lately that I suppose I was bound to come across a dud eventually. I wanted to like 'Shoplifters' but it just didn't work for me. Firstly, it's an extremely slow film. Now I have no problem with slow films simply for being the reason that they're slow ('Amour' is one of my favourite films of all time) but to be slow you have to have a couple of things. You have to have power and you have to have purpose. You need scenes that tell the audience a lot more is going on than meets the eye and you have to be subliminally telling the audience that their patience will be worth the wait. 'Shoplifters' had neither of those.

Only the film industry could ask you to side with a family of shoplifters. It actually comes up in the film later on in terms of right and wrong with quotes such as ""Whatever's in a store doesn't belong to anybody yet"" and ""As long as the store doesn't go bankrupt it's okay"". Obviously films have the right to have their characters do anything, but in this case I felt like I was being asked to side with them.

By the time the film started to develop a little and reveal itself I simply no longer cared. A lot of films set out to win awards, but some are better at hiding that fact than others. 'Shoplifters' felt to me like a film trying very hard to check all the boxes in order to win awards. There are some tremendous foreign language films out there. 'Shoplifters' isn't one of them.",5.0,1 December 2019
Koreeda's latest is a fine family drama with a quietly devasting finale,,,28 November 2018
The humanity and compassion of those who have nothing,"If the skill of the Director is to create space for the viewer to think, feel, reflect and re-consider, then Hirokazu Koreeda has achieved this with quiet triumph in Shoplifters. The portrayal of the complex, loving and subtle relationships between the main characters - who live together in poverty - is reminiscent of the writing of John Steinbeck in Cannery Row and Tortilla Flat. Our assumptions on how they have come together and how their relationships play out are progressively challenged, and are seen through a variety of lenses. The ultimate impact is both moving and intriguing and a great tribute to the craft of the Director and the talent of the cast.",10.0,27 November 2018
Great performance from Kirin Kiki in her final role,"Shoplifters: A non-nuclear family drama infused with humour set in Tokyo. We have Grandma Hatsue (Kirin Kiki)who subsidies the rest of the clan with her pension, the father Osamu (Lily Franky) is a casual labourer, he teaches son Shota (Kairi Jó) to shoplift while he causes distractions, mother Nobuyo (Sakura Ando) works in a laundry and steals valuables left in pockets, her sister Aki (Mau Matsuko) serves as a hostess in a bar. Their relationships is left open to question but they function as a family.

Coming home from a shoplifting expedition, Osamu and Shota find a cold and hungry young girl, Yuri (Miyu Sasaki), they bring her home and feed her. They try to return her home but Nobuyo hers Yuri's parents quarrelling and violence occurring. They decide to keep Yuri after discovering bruises on her arms. Life continues, Yuri becomes part of the family, Shota uses her as distraction during pilfering escapades. Then Yuri appears on TV, social services have discovered that she has been missing for two months without her parents reporting it.

A tale of family life in Japan, how family isn't always those who are related to you, rather they are the ones who care for you. Even when Osamu is injured at work and Nobuyo loses her job they don't abandon Yuri. There is an interdependence going on here, Grandma doesn't want to die alone so she allows this ersatz family to live with her. But even she has her own secrets. At different levels the houses adult inhabitants are exploiting as well as caring for eachother. This is at times a satire about Japanese family life and the dichotomies between supposed familial responsibilities in theory and in actuality.

A great performance from Kirin Kiki in her final role before she died earlier this year. Kairi and Miyu are covoncing as children who have had a hard life but are moving beyond it. Mostly cramped shots in the small house or dark shops contrasted with wider, brighter, pans along the banks of the River.

"Is blood thicker than water? (Thank you for everything, Kirin Kiki)","I think the reviews already sums up quite good how stunning this film is. In addition to extraordinary cinematographic work and music (!!!), Hirokazu Koreeda raises a lot of difficult, though important questions, leaving you thinking about your own moral values and the idea of a family. All wrapped up in a simple, well written and beautiful plot.

However, I would like to draw som more attention to Kirin Kiki and yet another one of her amazing interpretations. Only four months after the premier at Cannes, Kiki died, at the age of 75. In some strange way I get the sense that both Koreeda and Kiki somehow knew this was going to happen, during the creation of Shoplifters.

A Family of Shoplifters,An incredible film about the beauty of the bond between a family. This film is simultaneously heartbreaking and heart-warming.,8.0,4 August 2021
Stole my heart.,"'Shoplifters (2018)' is a slice-of-life drama focusing around an unconventional family and their unconventional methods of adoption - which the government technically define as kidnapping. The piece posits that you can actually choose your family, and that the bond between these chosen family members may be even stronger than between biological ones. It explores how victims of abuse can band together to make sure the same thing never happens to someone else, how giving birth doesn't automatically make you a mother and how being forced into conventional dynamics can actually be more harmful than helpful. The majority of the run-time is dedicated to the everyday lives of the focal characters. It's not particularly remarkable but it's always oddly engaging. This is primarily because the piece does a tremendous job in dealing out its exposition, slowly but satisfyingly unveiling the true nature of each individual, their group dynamic and the events that lead to the overall current state of affairs. Indeed, every core player seems markedly 'real', which is probably how you're able to empathise with them so easily. This is the case even when they make questionable decisions, for you always understand their situation and - if you pay attention - actually have a rather keen insight into their motivations, too. It's remarkably nuanced right up until its gut-punching finale, which realistically unravels the idealistic status-quo to bittersweet effect. In some ways, this final act feels like the real 'story' of the feature - if this is the case, things don't really get moving until over ninety-minutes in. However, the movie operates as a kind of ensemble-based character-study. The large amount of screen-time dedicated to each character, and to the overall group, never feels wasted. In fact, this meandering development actually is the narrative. It's unconventional, sure, but it works. Of course, the thing isn't the most exciting, gripping or, even, emotional affair to be released. It isn't really trying to be, though. Its focus is on realism and an, essentially, unbiased portrayal of a family operating on the fringes of society. It's often funny, usually charming and always enjoyable. Plus, it's easy to get invested in its disparate set of castaways. 7/10.",7.0,23 August 2019
Beautiful,"A beautiful, warm, and touching look at humanity through the lens of a group of people at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder.

A couple of them make money at menial jobs, one is a worker in a sad little sex club, another collects her dead husband's pension, and most of them supplement their income by stealing things. Director Hirokazu Kore-eda gives us a deeply humanistic film with these characters, but he doesn't idealize them. He shows us selfish, greedy, and manipulative behavior to go along with sacrifice and genuine love. There are so many threads beyond family and parenting, including hardships of abuse, alienation, and being a low-paid worker in a capitalistic society. For a film with such dark elements, there is a calm, benevolent acceptance of it all though, as if Kore-eda was looking down on humanity from up high.

Sakura Ando is absolutely gorgeous in this film, turns in a brilliant performance, and has some very sweet lines too. I almost melted when she hugged the abused little girl and said: ""The reason they hit you isn't because you are bad. If they say they hit you because they love you, that is a lie. If they love you, if they really love you, this is what you do..."" When you think of how such a group might be conceived of or portrayed, there is a sense of inversion when they act in these sublime, empathetic ways. We also see this in little moments like the sex worker hugging a clearly scarred regular patron, and when the shopkeeper who notices the kids stealing lets them go, simply warning the boy not to let his sister do that.

The angle the film takes relative to family is an interesting one. To choose your own family may be better and more meaningful than the 'real thing', but on the other hand, given the circumstances and how the group lives outside the law, there is a tenuous fragility about it. The film also explores simply surviving as an individual in a tough world, but in surviving, needing to cling to others, to do what's right for them as much as oneself, and to love them. These things reflect the human condition so perfectly that the film has a powerful aura about it. Highly recommended.",9.0,1 October 2019
Intriguing,"This film seems to have whooshed over the heads of quite a few reviewers who seem to be disappointed it's not an actioner or a porno. I found its mix of social comment and surrealism intriguing, it keeps you guessing while revealing a side of Japan you don't often see in films.",7.0,21 March 2020
Overrated,"An exercise in cheap shocks without anything holding together the disparate characters and their meandering arcs. This movie portrays a bunch of poor individuals living in the fringes of urban society and surviving by any means possible. Their relationships are suspect, there is some mystery in the proceedings as to their motivations or what drives them which never comes effectually in any of the slow burn sequences. It's just one mini episode after another, each one adding nothing to the feel or message of the movie. You don't care particularly for any one character since the focus shifts constantly from one to another without any cohesive thread holding it tight. The final half an hour is clumsily written and staged, the revelations cheapen the whole experience and feel engineered to evoke a response plus the movie's languid pace does not pay off at all in the end. Visuals are not arresting, it could be Tokyo or Thailand or China or wherever, there is nothing redeeming in this movie. It's shlock and shock and meandering and boring.",5.0,11 January 2019
Powerful,"This film tells the story of a family who takes in a young girl they found on the street.

Many Ways to Make a Family,"""Shoplifters"" is a simply wonderful movie about the many ways people can go about defining what it means to be family.

The family in this film ekes out an existence in modern-day Tokyo. They have jobs, but they supplement their livelihood by stealing and scrounging. They seem to live by their own moral code. They're not bad people -- in fact, in some ways they're quite good people -- but they do things others would consider to be bad, and they're not overly concerned about hurting others along the way, albeit usually not in major ways. What we learn about them in regular and subtle reveals over the course of the film is that none of them are actually related by blood, yet they've cobbled together a family full of more closeness, happiness, and solidarity than any of them has with those they're related to in the traditional sense.

""Shoplifters"" is my favorite kind of movie because it suggests that people can be many things at once and defy categorization. We learn to know these folks, warts and all, and it's up to us how to feel about them. The movie doesn't make decisions for us. I sort of fell in love with them, and while I didn't necessarily condone all of the things they did, I felt terrible at the end that the life they managed to build together out of unlikely circumstances couldn't continue.

In a movie full of excellent performances, the one I can't get out of my head is that of Sakura Ando as the ""mother."" When we first meet her, it seems like she might be the coldest and most detached of the group, but by the movie's end we realize how responsible she is for holding everything together. It's a shame a performance like hers is too off the beaten path to ever be considered for Oscar attention, because she deserves it. The film itself is up for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2018 Oscars. It won't win, but it doesn't need an award to validate its greatness.

Grade: A+",10.0,5 February 2019
Shoplifters,"Maybe because I work in a retail store, I perhaps have a bit of a one sided, or jaded approach to theft, or shoplifting seeing as the store where I work deals with it on an almost every day basis. This ranges from people peeling off stickers on items and replacing them with lower ones to get away with paying less, or sometimes it's just a simple matter of people stuffing items into their purse, backpack, or pockets to get certain items. I tend to be a bit more lenient when it concerns this as opposed to some of my coworkers and superiors who would probably prefer me to be as tough as nails on the issue. While I am totally and completely against all forms of theft and robbery, I still can't help, but think that maybe there are some underlying issues here that should be paid attention to. Are these people doing it because they are kleptomaniacs and get a thrill from each item they steal, or is it more than that such as people who are hurting financially and could really use a break? The store where I work is a charitable organization, so we do have programs and services set up to help the less fortunate and if one of them came to us with a letter, or voucher from a shelter, or government sponsor, we would certainly and have given out free clothing and supplies. Is it really necessary for people to steal, or are some doing out of absolute desperate means? This new film, Shoplifters asks a very important question with this as we see this group of people who engage in stealing and otherwise dishonest means in order to support themselves. We see the kind of place where they live and how rundown it is and how most things people here in America consider everyday life these people would consider an absolute luxury. Is it necessary for them to carry on this lifestyle and what example is it setting for the children and could it possibly later corrupt them? The film places no judgments upon them by either saying they are good, or bad people, but instead shows us a different kind of lifestyle and one that is perhaps unknown to most of us, but probably should be known. We worry about the influence of these people and how long they can get away with what they are doing as well as when trouble does finally come, what will be the outcome? We see that this group of people do generally have the best interests of one another and they seem to have a bond that even when it is tested seems to be something that can't be separated. The film presents an interesting topic and suggests that maybe there is more services and programs necessary for people like this and as viewers we are not to turn a blind eye against the poor and needy, but to help out in whatever capacity available. The performances are all very natural and genuine and henceforth more believable and emits more empathy from the viewers. This is a film with something important to say and yet it doesn't judge, or condemn, but instead leaves us with a lingering problem that suggest that as a people and society we have a lot of work to do. A moving film that is a masterpiece in and of itself and one of 2018's finest achievements.",10.0,24 February 2019

TEARS TO OUR EYES,"Shoplifters don't reveal, in the English title, who these criminals are. In the original title in Japanese, it is explicit that the members of the ""family"" Shibata are contumacious store thieves.

However, it is not only this activity that unites them. The family has strong ties except those of blood, for it is the shortage that makes this cluster of people stand and act like an actual family.

The matriarch Hatsue, the Grandma, lives on a small alimony received from her ex-husband since the divorce. Today dead, her husband continues to receive posthumous honors. In the house, tiny, still live the Daddy and the Mother, Osamu and Nobuyo, that we will discover later to have united in a striking and traumatic episode. He is a hod carrier and she works in a laundry room, picking up, here and there, little forgotten trinkets in the pockets of the clothes. There are two more inhabitants in the house: a 10-year-old boy (who sleeps in a closet) and a young Aki, the granddaughter of Hatsue's ex-husband, who works as hostess in a club, where she shows off for costumers.

In the opening scene, Osamu and the boy Shota return home after a choreographed swipe at a market (though they have forgotten the shampoo), when they encounter a 5-year-old girl left on the balcony of her house, probably by her violent and negligentparents. Fearing that the little girl Yuri dies of cold, they take her with them to their home, where she is at first rejected, and later ""adopted"" by the family.

Although the girl later becomes wanted by the police, the Shibatas do not worry because, in their particular code of ethics, they understand that there is only kidnapping if there is a request for ransom. Likewise, they believe there is no theft if the goods have not yet been sold to clients unless the store that sells them is going bankrupt.

Hirokazu Kore-eda builds a minimalist and beautiful movie as if it were a large onion that we were gradually stripping until we discovered, among acid layers, a core that brings tears to our eyes.",9.0,14 May 2019
"Does just living together makes a family, a family? !!","Shoplifters, though on the slower side, will definitely endure as a classic film about family.

Writer & Director Hirokazu Koreeda's portrayal of a family with a difference, marginals, holding down lowly poorly paid jobs, surviving by shoplifting, living on their wits, but when they take in a newcomer to their heart, the story unfolds. What follows is almost a utopic vision of family life, especially perhaps the idyllic outing to the seaside.

Director Hirokazu Koreeda uses lots of close-ups where the profound humanity and truth of the characters rises to the surface of their faces. The effect overall is that of a stage play; there is a wonderful closeness or intimacy about this film on every level, physical and emotional. But there is much more to these marginalised characters and their relationships than is readily apparent. After the boy, Shota, is caught shoplifting their lives and stories begin to unravel in a surprising way altogether.

Cinematography is pristinely good, especially the lowly placed shots. Screenplay is slow, but has a soul on its and the story blooms through its characters. Though a little bit on the lengthy side, editing is wonderfully crafted. Production design, costumes and makeup are brilliant. Music is subtle and used sparingly. All the actors played their parts quite convincingly, none of them trying to out perform each other. In short, together they looked like a family.

Overall, Shoplifters is a clever and subversive film which asks profound questions about what makes a family, and what are the bonds that join us, while casting a wry eye on Japanese society. It is a film of immense tenderness compassion humanity and wisdom, which will not fail to move you. The film feels simultaneously hopeful and uplifting as well as harsh and depressing. The working class poor he depicts aren't cliched and downtrodden, They are bright and playful, canny and insightful, thoughtful and even philosophical. The movie will not be suitable to everyone, but for those who don't mind a slow burn, it is definitely worth a try. 7.3 stars out of 10 for bringing out several hidden themes & layers within.",7.0,6 June 2021
Enjoyable with simple moments that defines family.,"Shoplifter is set on the edge of Tokyo about a misfit family that has to rely on petty crimes to survive. Though they might not be bonded by blood, their misfortune brings them together to become a simple and loving family. As their story comes to light, their crimes and intentions are questioned.

Ambiguous family values,"I tend to dislike most films about poverty and inequality, but ""Shoplifters"" managed to be reasonably entertaining without overdoing in sentimentality. We are first introduced to the perfect dysfunctional family, but as the film goes on, we find out that the situation is way more complicated than we imagined. This is not Koreeda's first film to question the value of blood ties in making a family, but this time he seems more neutral towards his characters. There are dozens of tender moments to point out the authenticity of their bonds, but at the same time, we are continuously made aware that we are still talking about dishonest, self-centered people. Maybe not as sober as Koreeda's previous films, but still more natural and believable than your average Japanese drama spoiled by melodramatic acting and stereotyped dialogues.",7.0,14 August 2021

"Official Review of an Unofficial Family - Winterim, The Foreign Film Festival","This movie tells the story of a group of japanese people who represent a ""family"" despite having no relationship to each other. We think it's a good movie, although it can get pretty confusing, very quickly. This is because of the amount of people that don't go by their real names and the fact that some characters use other character's names. (NO SPOILER) The children in the family have been taken by the father , and are used to shoplift from stores due to the family living in poverty. They find a little girl outside of her house, and take her in to save her from her own family's abuse. The film aims to define family- not by blood but by soul- and their eventual downfall. The five most important characters in this movie are Yuri, Shota, Grandma, Osamu, Kie Miyabe, and Aki Shibata. Along with the intricate familial connections that are referenced in the movie multiple times, this makes the movie a good movie with some disconcerting aspects. Ultimately, we think this movie's lesson is about seeing past prejudice. The movie introduces the characters in this film as a ""family"", you come to learn throughout the movie that this isn't exactly a traditional family, and that what bonds them all together initially is having committed something which society considers ""wrong"" (murder, thieving, kidnapping, benefits fraud, etc). But as a viewer, you have been made to care for each of these characters, despite what brought them all together. It's a movie about things not always being as they seem, and what that ultimately doesn't matter. The people at their chore, care for each other, in their own strange way. We don't think this movie is necessarily accessible to young people, but more people in their 20s or 30s.",8.0,23 March 2021

SOCIAL REALISM AT ITS FINEST,,10.0,23 May 2018
Family concepts,"Great movie set in the nowhere of Tokyo with an unconventional plot and outstanding acting performances.

It seems to present us a family, which tries to supplement its scarce family income by continuous shoplifting. The simple justification for this immoral behavior is that the shop items do not yet belong to anybody. Next to this little weakness, the family ties seem to be in good shape as family members do listen to each other.

The trick of the movie is that it is constantly laying trails of doubt whether these people living together in the small dingy house surrounded by big apartment blocks are in fact a real family. Why is it so easy for most of them to accept little Yuri as a new family member? Why does Shota refuse to call Osamu his Dad? How can Hatsue tell Nobuyo that she has chosen her as her daughter?

Trains of thought start what else they may be if not a family and what brought and keeps them together. According to a statement in the movie, it is actually money, which makes the bonds. This in the end turns out to be (the unpleasant) part of the truth but no more than that.

Then, around the next corner, the movie makes you think why not to call these people a family as they apparently care for each other. Why should not they share a common shelter if it keeps them off loneliness? Has not 5-year-old Yuri chosen to stay with these people rather than with her real family where nobody seems to like her? In this way, the movie suggests that there are various concepts to a family and that the one based on common blood is not necessarily the best.

Next to this central issue, I also liked the movie because of its Japanese peculiarities. For example, all the eating is done while sitting on the floor and the noodles are sucked into the mouth in a loud and for European ears rather disgusting way. On the other hand, it is surprising to see Japanese characters that are both highly human and imperfect at the same time.",10.0,18 November 2019
Amazing,"This film skyrocketed to one of my favorite films ever. This film makes you question, deeply, what love, family, and humanity all is. It's the only film I know of that is paced as a slice-of-life film with an underlying thriller/mystery feel. Truly amazing.",,7 September 2020
Sensitive direction and a marshmallow storyline,"I will not expand here on the delicate direction and sensitive story. I guess plenty of people have been writing and singing about this but, if I may be a tad insensitive, mastering direction and having a nice storyline is not sufficent to make a great movie.

I enjoyed it, as I always enjoy the craft of highly-skilled/gifted directors, but come on, Shoplifters really plays it easy with its sugar-coated storyline. ""Subtle"" here means a recipe where you bundle 100% golden-heart characters with some potentially darker but not-so-important backstories that audience is allowed to know in the end. The emotional stress stays the same all along, aside from the little girl's situation (which stays pretty generic) there is no one you can really empathize with. Basically, gentle characters are well directed within an empty shell.

In a nushell I enjoyed the craft but kept waiting for another dimension to materialize, and in the end this movie stands light years behind references like de Sica's Bicycle Thief or Kurosawa's Donzoko.",6.0,17 March 2019
One of the best japanese movies so far,"The chemistry between actors, outstanding story telling by director, character developments, the camera works (especially showing the family watching hanabi from the upper view makes us understand the life of an outsider) and the unsaid words to each others. Perfect!! Perfect drama!",10.0,27 November 2020
Solid Effort,"Realistic performances, brass-bound comradery, and some startling, natural comedic tones makes Shoplifters a solid time at the theaters. The addition of having some of the most charismatic moments of the year sprinkled throughout, also, nearly raises it to glory. An adequately challenging ending to top off the piece, furthermore, supplemented some noticeably thought-provoking slices of commentary on the bitter truths of how the real world works.

'Tis a shame, however, that Shoplfiters kind of reflected off to me as the poor man's Florida Project, personally. There was zero to nothing explored in this movie that I hadn't already witnessed from previous filmic dramas. I may have been emotionally affixed to the characters, but there still wasn't enough idiosyncrasy or even enough engrossment in the events/segments for me to appreciate its sum. It's cinematic flair, while well-done, wasn't anything noteworthy or outreaching/boundary-pushing-of course, according to my judgement.

I know, I'm one sinister human being for not loving Shoplifters. Mwahahahahahahahaha. (Verdict: C+)",6.0,22 November 2018

The pacing is good and it's visually nice to look at. I loved the sets and the environments, especially the house. It told the viewer a lot about the characters in subtle ways.

Speaking of the characters, they're all wonderful. Every one of them is real and flawed and dynamic. The performances of the child actors was great, some of the best acting by young children that I've seen.

Can't think of a better movie that wonders about the true meaning of family,"Shoplifters is the story of a family living in the outskirts of Tokyo, which is already struggling to get by everyday, and how they manage to deal with harbouring a lost child in their home.

The interesting thing is the family's actual bonds - blood or otherwise - don't become clear until very late in the movie (perhaps not even then).

The film is visually stunning. Among other things, it really makes you feel cramped in their tiny apartment and has some brilliantly taken shots - the one from the place where Shota, the older kid sleeps, is my favourite.

The film is already a masterpiece by then, but the way it quickly unfolds in its last 20-30mins is quite gripping and incredibly emotional - where all relationships are stretched and/or unearthed.

Goes straight into the list of my favourite movies, off to see others by Hirokazu Korreda!",9.0,24 October 2019
A masterpiece of storytelling with serious commentary,"This movie is exceptional in a variety of ways. Starting from storytelling, you get almost instantly absorbed and invested in the lives of the characters, with a perfect harmony between the interactions of them al, Koreeda achieves an evolution of the characters, while driving the main plot and also portraying to delightful success the daily lives of the characters. As a viewer I think it would be very difficult not to connect to the experiences of the children, and to relate deep enough so that questions of family and the meaning of it arise while not discarding the crooked lifestyle of the family.

This movie is Cinema at its finest, exceptional execution of a story while leaving the viewer with deep questions of fundamental issues like family itself, and the moral and ethical themes that arise from relevant problems such as intrafamilial violence, poverty and theft, by a retrospect that shows all their nuances, true to life.",10.0,21 March 2020

What a family should be.,"The thief Osamu and his son, returning from ""work"", pick up a girl in the street who seems abandoned. Although reluctant, Osamu's wife agrees to shelter the little girl for the night. Then, when she learns that Aki is mistreated by her parents, she decides to keep her. Although poor, living on small raids, they all live a happy family life. Until...

What is family? A union imposed by genetics and codified by society? Or a group of people living together united by the bonds of the heart? Who really deserves the name of parents for little Aki? Those, genetic, who hit her and neglect her or those of substitution who wrap her in love, even if they are thieves? Kore-Eda (as in ""Like father like son"" in particular) clearly leans towards the second case. A theme that the director treats with subtlety and depth, far from any easy moralism... He really is the Japanese Comencini. What also characterizes Kore-Eda is the fine way he directs his actors: under his guidance, all prove convincing, whether young, adult or old (special mention for Kirin Kiki, the grandmother) but it is the children who really get their way: this tall, thin boy, who is beginning to mature and this little flea, beaten and abandoned, who has difficulty in verbalizing, do not seem to play: they are the characters. The only problemetic things are the slow rhythm, the lack of climactic scenes and a slightly excessive duration.

A masterpiece.,"The ghosts of Dickens, De Sica and Ozu hover over every frame of Hirokazu Koreeda's magnificent film ""Shoplifters"". This cross between ""Oliver Twist"" and ""Shoeshine"" but filmed in the style of Ozu's ""Ohayo"" is about a family of thieves in contemporary Tokyo who find a little, five-year-old girl abandoned by her abusive parents, take her in, shower her with affection and teach her to steal. They may be amoral and they may be lawbreakers but sometimes we find goodness in the strangest of places and in the least likely of people. What's worse, the film asks; stealing food and clothes or 'rescuing' a child, a crime society and the world at large views as the greater theft.

If the style of the film is neo-realist, the concept is purely humanist and, for once, Koreeda comes across as a Japanese Ken Loach and, like Loach, he draws extraordinarily naturalistic performances from his entire cast, (Miyu Sasuki, the little girl playing Yuri, is absolutely perfect), and there are great moments here, as good as any in recent cinema.

A very human and humble adventure,"This is a typical ""slice of life"" kind of drama, and it's very well done.

We follow a small family that struggles with poverty in a small house, and they are shoplifting. Suddenly they came by a street where they see a little girl which seems very sad, and her parents are yelling at each other. They decide to keep her for a while, they don't know for how long.

The characters are interesting and easy to identify to. What I really liked is that everyone in the family is helping in his own way, and you can see that despite the poverty they are very bound to each other. The little girl is slowly integrated to the family and she and her new sister start to have moral issues with shoplifting. The psychology is subtle and nicely thought.

The photography is really neat, we have a sense of depth in the composition, it's really clever and beautiful.

Living in a shack out of grandmother's pension.. they receive money from relatives... most of them have jobs.. being a ""peep show girl"" is definitely not the best job, but still I couldn't figure out what does the family do with the money... Somehow I could not feel for them at all.. At least they saved a kid from abusive parents, but the movie is full of nonsense, the end making it even worse.. What was supposed to be the message here?

Film Review: Shoplifters/www.nightfilmreviews.com,"Shoplifters by Hirokazu Koreeda is one of the most beautiful portraits of the family household and its elements ever graced on-screen, and yes, that is how I am starting this review. While the last little while has been an array of firsts, experiencing a Koreeda film, I found myself recalling immortal auteurs like Yasujiro Ozu with his ""seasons"" series of melodramas, chiefly revolving around domestic trials and tribulations of man and humanity itself. At times I found it played like a Vittorio De Sica film, sprawling with driven poverty and poetic synthesis, proving on being a companion piece to his infamous Bicycle Thieves. While this film is already in the company of great films, winning the Palme D'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival, Shoplifters is absolutely spellbinding! It's a film that is reviving the idea that modern cinema can move and transcend audiences in the most simplistic and organic of settings and motions.

In my humblest and sincerest personal opinion, classic French, Italian and Japanese cinema produces truly spiritual, dreamlike cinematic material. Works from these countries articulate family, love, and spirituality through a lens that is equally transformative yet daringly raw and different from Western cinema. Ringing true to the genuine human condition than anything I have seen from Hollywood, Shoplifters is a film that has shifted my opinion on modern directors and modern cinema as a whole. With Shoplifter's we are truly drawn to a familiar world where the lens provides a gaze though the eyes of a real auteur. While I always disregarded the notion that anything shot with a modern camera in modern settings could materialize into the type of work that Kurosawa or Ozu have created, I have always believed filmmakers like these have unmatched qualities, until now. Koreeda's extreme sense of self-awareness and implementing a strong social dynamic, the characters and narrative of Shoplifters blossoms into a truly hearty cinematic experience.

Although the story and narrative of Shoplifters really has no real importance, this is a film that truly draws from its actors and their interactions, to create a family that really delves into the depths of complex moral issues, bonds of love and the ideas of nature versus nurture, that hasn't been seen in film for many years. Yet, the casting in the film is perhaps, and although this may be a wholly bold statement, the best casting I have seen in at least a decade. Ranging from young child actors to older and respected Japanese acting icons, each familial role is worked and managed into broken down fibres of relatable family members we have in our own lives.

The film tells the story of the Shibata's. Osamu Shibata, played by Lily Franky, the real patriarch of the family, provides the film with the majority of its humour, especially when he is teaching his 'children' the fine 'art' of theft. Early on, we see that he passes on his skills to his 'son' Shota played exceptionally well by Jyo Kairi. Relentless and effortless, the two are shown to be very close and possessing so many of the dynamics seen between a father and son relationship we have come to expect in film. Shota's mother, Nobuyo (Sakura Hando) works at a dry cleaners providing her share for the family, also engaging in forms of theft. Nobuyo's sister Aki (May Matsuoka) works at a soft-core gentlemen's cyber club performing for her dividend. All of the finances rendezvous at the flat the family stays in tucked away in an extremely quiet neighborhood. A large chunk of the rent that comes along with space is paid for by the true matriarch of the household, Grandmother Hatsue, played tirelessly by Kirin Kiki, who recently passed at the tender age of seventy-five.

While each character's role is paramount in expressing the moral teachings in Koreeda's perfectly woven story, there is a firm affinity for Koreeda's sense of family and togetherness that does not go unnoticed. Each family member play each of their respectable roles honestly, spreading words and dialogue that ceases to shy from the harsh realities of such a lifestyle, yet brilliantly completely shatter society's belittling and scoffing nature towards them by being individual embodiments of humanity at all stages and ages of life.

The family begins to change its dynamic when Osamu and Shota walk home one evening from a routine shoplift, and find Yuri (Miyu Sasaki), a small child left in the barren waste of her broken family's home. Together, the two males bring Yuri back home, and the family agrees to keep her safe and make her one of them, a Shibata, due to their parents physical, emotional and mental abuse that can be heard from the open windows of their home. Once Yuri becomes a Shibata, the unravelling of a strong family unit begins, and in the most beautiful and gut-wrenching of fashion, even if what we are experiencing on-screen can easily be argued as kidnapping. Yet, one of the strongest questions in the film remains, is love experienced by strangers better than no love at all experienced by the people you call family?

To call Shoplifters unequivocally beautiful is an understatement. Shot by Kondo Ryuto with a diamond touch in 35mm, an utilizing a medium shot style of filming, which gives great emphasis to the family's dialogue, action/reaction shots and allows for actors to truly embody their characters, with each one of their quips to be internalized. With amazing attention to detail, Akiko Matsuba, set designer to the film, allows his vision combined with Koreeda's small yet meaningful narrative acts, magnify the characters powerful revelations onto the screen.

Although the main use of 3D in film, back when the medium was in its infancy, was implicated for the further immersion of audiences into the films they are watching, with films like Shoplifters, the true immersion audiences experience are into feelings of true warmth, a sensation that radiates from every scene and frame of Koreeda's Shoplifters. Shoplifters is a film that immerses the immersion of the soul. Focusing less on the actions happening around them and more of the facial, boldly and emotional reactions of his actors, the film is a true testament to the beauty of simplicity and minimalist cinema. One of the film's most powerful scenes, and easily my personal favourite, was a scene where we see the Shibata family collectively hang out of an open panned window, looking into the sky and stars, listening to the sounds and explosions of nearby fireworks. Hovering over the family like a precarious object, the camera captures the colours of its characters wonderment and marvel, as opposed to the fascinating and beautiful array of flames and fire in the sky. This shot alone showcases the very real and adorning obsession with Koreeda's skill and his fascination with human beings. Shoplifter's becomes a film who's universal look and bodily acting skills transcends language, countries, sects, cultures and religious beliefs. This scene alone had my heart fluttering with pure joy and happiness; a feeling that has been voided for me since seeing Akira Kurosawa's High and Low.

To describe how simply sensational and dynamic Shoplifters is as a film is similar to trying to describe color to a blind person; it isn't a simple task and perhaps, in the end, no words or description may do a colour justice. Shoplifters is similar to this feeling and sensation; no matter how much I try to articulate my feelings towards it, nothing can prepare you for the level of hypnosis and the mesmerizing nature of a film that really only features people and the truly genuine emotions they express. Hirokazu Koreeda's Shoplifters is easily the best film I have seen in 2018 and it is my highest recommendation to all lovers of cinema and lovers of people; It is a film that should be seen and embraced because, simply put, the film will steal elements of your heart...forever!",10.0,26 December 2018

"Like Father, Like Son","At first, it seems like humanity has been restored as we get covered under the warm blanket, during winter days, by some strangers who live near the side road. Then Kore-eda appears to deftly take every piece of us apart. He nimbly arranges and turns our hearts into punching bags before stealthily removing them from our chests forever.

the family brought together by circumstance,"Shoplifters is a Japanese movie about a group of misfits come together to form a makeshift family. Shoplifter had really great performances from the adult actors to the child actors who manage to capture the aspects of their characters wonderfully.

Shoplifters is a movie about how people who are lost and marginalised by society, but does not present them in a negative light per se; there was a sense of comradery that turns into familial love and unconditional support amongst the members of the 'family'. The film pacts a strong emotional impact that remind me a lot of another Japanese film 'Granny Gabai' which looks at a child who is sent away from his parents to live with his grandma. There is that same sense of love and support amongst those who are marginalised.

By the end of the movie, Shoplifters leaves its viewers bawling, with its honest depiction of life on the edge of Japanese society and its social commentary, Shoplifters is truly a special movie that does its best to show us an unseen side of Japan.",8.0,29 September 2019
CUTEST CRIME STORY,"Shoplifters is a crime movie with a family theme. It has clear messages about family, city life and crime rate. It has a good cinematography, visuality makes movie more sincere. Although story is not amazingly wonderful; it has a different tone, interesting characters and a bit mystery. Because we know little clues about every character during the movie but we don't know whole story. Also my favourite thing about this movie is Jyo Kairi's character. He is such a noble kid. And worst thing is it didn't made a big emotional effect on me. Especially second part is a bit disorganised.",7.0,4 February 2019
Nothing to take away from it.,"As others mention, this movie starts slow and progressively gets slower. I can appreciate an art movie, but this one will be forgotten in a few years. I does not show you new worlds, does not change your perspective on anything, it does not make you think, it just shows you:
artificially long scenes about people wasting away (""twist"": some of them are kind),
brief flashes of bad parenting
kids adapting to what's offered to them without knowing anything else.


It's slow two hours of your life, that won't make you a better/happier/wiser person. Some expositions are nice though for the first few seconds, then you'll get bored with them, then a few minutes later, we move to the next one. An other big annoyance is that the movie purposefully holds back information that is available for all characters. This information is then later revealed in small doses, but nothing justifies this approach other than artificially creating ""suspense"" for the audience. (I.e. in the first hour, you're guessing what is the situation with these people and their relationship.)

Two things could have made it better:

Choose your family,"This unique film about family love will be without a doubt a modern classic. It was fascinating, shocking but most of all heartwarming. An interesting look in the poorer outskirts of Japan tells the story of an, at first instance, normal Japanese family. As time progresses you slowly get drawn into a tale of survival told with a cheeky smile.

It was cute and naughty, but as hard as reality gets with suberb acting and a intriguing storyline.

The perfect balance between emotionalism and intellectualism,"Shoplifters is an empathic Japanese drama nominated for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It convinces with strong actresses and actors and especially child actors Sasaki Miyu and Kairi Jyo are absolutely incredible and should have a great career in the future. The film is directed calmly, intimately and precisely and shows us how a group of societal outcasts stick together to find a common purpose in life. The movie criticizes the perception of homeless, lonely and poor people and makes you wonder whether the actual kidnappers and thieves are to blame or whether those who ignored and mistreated them have a big part in their development.

The film tells the story of a group of poor people who live in a small house in a depressing neighbourhood of Tokyo that is owned by a lonely elderly woman who supports the group with her deceased husband's pension. One day, the adult labourer who has assumed the role of the family father and the young boy that has been living with the family for several years witness a sad girl on a balcony on a cold night while her mother is getting into a physical and verbal fight with a man. The laborer and the boy pity the girl and decide to take her with them. They initially plan to bring her back the next day but the girl doesn't want to go back and prefers staying with the family. She bonds with the unique group of people and especially looks up to the boy whom she perceives like an older brother she can trust. They spend much time together and learn positive and negative things from each other. When the brother however observes how his sister starts stealing in local shops like he has been doing for a long period of time, he decides to take the blame to make her stop. His selfless sacrifice has unexpected consequences on the entire group that considers itself a genuine family.

Shoplifters is a movie that will touch your heart but also involve your brain and make you think. Despite a slow pace, the movie is never dull and each character is developed carefully. The viewer ends up empathizing with the different characters despite their flaws because they are gentle at heart. The movie's ending will make you reconsider the values of family and friendship as the lines between good and evil are constantly blurred throughout the film. Shoplifter finds the perfect balance between emotionalism and intellectualism. It would certainly deserve most to win this year's Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.",8.0,16 February 2019
Japanese festival film,"The three generations of the Shibata family live in a ramshackle house. The working poor family is a well-organized shoplifting team. They find neighborhood girl Yuri in the cold night and take her home. They suspect negligence and decide to incorporate her into the family business. As the story unfolds, the family is even more complicated than first appearances.

The style is humanistic and naturalistic. There is a reality to the performances. The kids are new and compelling. The adults are also very compelling. There are surprising turns and it all feels real. It's a great little movie.",8.0,6 August 2019
a family in and of itself,"The basic question posed by Hirokazu Kore-eda's ""Manbiki kazoku"" (""Shoplifters"" in English) is what it means to be a family. The focus is a homeless family forced to resort to shoplifting just to have things to eat. And then they adopt an abandoned girl. Might this family be a better environment for the girl than was her ""real"" family?

There's nothing glossy here, just the straight, gritty stuff. It's a different image of Japan than we're used to seeing. We're used to seeing sensory overload, but here we see a brood on the margins. Every society is bound to have a homeless family or two: someone to do the work that no one else will do.

Anyway, it's an outstanding movie. I look forward to seeing Kore-eda's next movie.",10.0,22 July 2019
A messy script that could have been something,"The writer / director is trying real hard to mimic the ""classics"" about whom he learned in school. So the result is slow and static. As the pre-Kurosawa directors, the story is polished, but when you polish dung, it's highly improbable to get diamonds.

What is this story about? The girl. But there are enough elements thrown in to make at least one season of a NetFlix series.

It can also be about the whole family. Which pops out of nowhere and goes pretty much nowhere.

Or the social status. There are Marxist elements, just like in the works of the old Japanese directors.

It can be a societal critique. It can be a lot of things. In the end, there are at least 10 movies mashed in to fill up the two hours.

Add to that an opaque background and weird Japanese superstition. Why are the children making the small ritual? The script is simply too provincial to deserve the International exposure it got.",,24 May 2019

What Constitutes a Family? And Who Decides?,"Ruminations on the essence of family with a scrappy group of bottom-feeders, discarded and neglected by society at large. Living well below the poverty line, stealing what they can't afford, their household exists on the outskirts of civilization; a phantom in more ways than one. The general population is perfectly happy to turn a blind eye upon the situation and this ragtag, close-knit little unit is content with the same arrangement, despite the guarded air of closeted secrets looming over the household.

It's the kind of film you know probably doesn't end well, so you just enjoy the good times while they last. The movie itself seems to feel the same way, lingering in those sweet moments of quiet memory and cozy togetherness for as long as it can, delaying the inevitable. Of course, eventually something has to give, and then it's a crushing landslide of sudden public interest and consequence, hitting all the harder for the delicate harmony that existed, so freely, prior to the vortex.

What makes a family: the other side told honestly,"This is a Japanese language film from 2018.

The theme of the film is ""What makes a family"". As the lead actress says in the film, it's when you choose your family that the bonding is stronger. And that's the case the film tries to make.

And to give credit to the creators, they have picked up the most complex situation of a family that indulges in petty crimes of Shoplifting to make the case. Knowing fully well how it would then have to end.

To have consistency in laws and ensure civility, obviously such a family had to be broken up even though they had rescued the children. Even though the children ended up being orphaned actually by pulling them out from these make- believe parents.

You feel sorry for the couple, and that's what the film's purpose is, to show you the other side of the picture. But the creators still have been honest in the way they led the story to the culmination.

HEARTLIFTERS,"This is tragic movie. Tragic in that it exposes the sad life of societal fringe dwellers. This is an uplifting movie in that it shows us that love, kindness and care can transcend social norms and structures in the most powerful way.

The acting is unbelievable across the board. Amazing performances by the kids in particular. Koreeda is masterful. He extracts so much emotion and depth with the simplest of shots and facial expressions from this mixed cast.

Life on the margins,"We all only get one life, but society imposes a lot of rules about how we should live it. But what is society offers us no support, no help? Then perhaps we have to live by our own. 'Shoplifters' tells a heartbreaking story about a desperately poor family living on the margins of society. Bound together by a combination of necessity and love, they live, not as gangsters, but as petty criminals, engaging in acts unthinkable for the rest of us: shoplifting, killing an abuser, adopting an unloved child without telling anyone, burying an elderly relative in the backyard. Yet in some senses, thiers is a quiet, decent, working family; just one abandoned by the world. This is a fine movie, sensistive and sad. It's not a true story, but it seems nonetheless to say something profound about our world.",9.0,21 August 2021
"A journey inside a dysfunctional family, with a dramatic twist.","""Shoplifters"" portrays a dysfunctional family that tries to survive, despite their difficult financial situation. The adults are teaching the kids how to shoplift, in order to get food. It is very obvious that the parents do not really want to improve their living conditions in any way. We discover later on that they committed some heinous crimes and their behavior is despicable. However, the director was able to show that these people also have a good side and they love every single member of this unconventional family in the same way. This is one of those movies that made me think a lot and it put me in front of many ethical dilemmas. I love when filmmakers portray real issues in front of a camera and make the audience waver. The general mood tends to be light-hearted, but the movie exposes several important and complex topics related to Japanese society.

The cast was good, I have to praise the job done by Sakura Andô, Lily Frank and Kirin Kiki, who were able to express in a convincing way many different emotions. Overall the acting is very natural, and this is what made this film great: it felt very close to reality. I enjoyed the photography, which is simple and yet interesting. The plot is amazing and there is a very dark and unexpected twist. Some elements of the plot tend to be a bit dragged: at times I wondered if the film would finally move on. Cutting down a few scenes would make it a bit more digestible. For sure it is a flick that takes its own time to properly develop the characters, therefore if you are into slow burners, this might be a nice treat.",7.0,27 July 2022

"Well-crafted, humane, and human","It takes a while to process this very compelling, and somewhat disturbing film that zooms in, almost anthropoligically, on the bizarre ""family"" life of a group of lost souls on the margins of Japanese society. And it took me a night's sleep to even try to articulate what the movie is really about.

The acting is great, particularly by the children, who were clearly superbly directed and mentored. ""Shoplifters"" sometimes feels like a documentary, as it reveals the daily life of three generations of aimless people brought together by randomness and fate, but have a bond that is inexplicable but heartfelt. The movie casts a neutral light on this group without judgment or service to a predictable narrative arc. Still, it holds your interest, goes by quickly, and has a surprising finish that is both honest and shocking.

They learnt to find joy in the little things and displaying love without conditions or expectations.

"An breath-taking display of realism, a lesson in empathy and an exploration of the meaning of family conveyed in 120 minutes.","This was the first movie by the Japanese director Hiorkazu Koreeda that I've seen, and I was blown away. Koreeda, like his earlier works, continues his exploration of the true meaning of family in Shoplifters. This is breathtaking movie evokes so many emotions in the audiences and it does it so well, that its very hard not to connect to the Shibata Family. This is the second international movie this year I have seen about the repressed and the poor trying to live their lives, the first being Parasite. And it goes without saying, if you loved that one, then you'll love this one even more as Shoplifters is definitely more realistic and more powerful as a story.

Shoplifters focusses on marginalized people existing on the fringes of Japanese society who barely eke out a living by engaging in activities that skirt the letter of the law. It is the story of flawed people who have patched together a working ""family"" of outcasts who believe that the impulse to survive and create a nurturing environment is more important than strict adherence to society's norms and blood relations.

The film opens in a supermarket where Osamu Shibata (Lily Franky), a middle-aged, part-time construction worker, is seen exchanging strange hand signals with a pre-teenage boy, Shota (Jyo Kairi), who seems to regard what is going on as a family outing. It quickly becomes apparent that this is no ordinary family shopping spree but an exercise in shoplifting, as we watch Shota casually throw items from the shelves into his shopping bag when no one is looking. Justifying their flouting of the law, Osamu says that if the goods are in the store, it means that they do not belong to anyone, and tells Shota that they are stealing the items only as a means of helping the family. Much later when questioned about stealing by the authorities, sadly he says that shoplifting was the only skill he had to teach the boy.

Osamu, as it is gradually revealed, is the part of a household consisting of himself and wife Noboyu Shibata (Sakura Ando), wife's teenaged sister (but from a different mother) Aki Shibata (Mayu Matsuoka), Osamu and Noboyu's young son Shota, and grandma Hatsue Shibata (the late Kirin Kiki), all living in a small, cluttered apartment outside of Tokyo, scattered with toys and knick-knacks everywhere, barely providing the family with enough room to eat and sleep.

This warm but abnormal family is slowly revealed to be conjoined in ways we did not expect. The catalyst for this is dad and son bringing home a neglected 5-year-old girl, by the name of Yuri (Miyu Sasaki), they come across abandoned on an apartment balcony on a freezing winter night. The girl comes home with them, and slots into the family, a pattern, we slowly realize, that has been repeated in the past. Granny was 'picked up,' and the son seems to have arrived by similar means. Their warmth and humanity is at odds with the illegality and disregard for social mores. Society judges such people, but by allowing us intimacy with them, Koreeda shows how society is also judged by them - and found wanting.

Shoplifters for its most part is focused on this families daily life and the problems they face emphasizing on their bonds, their empathy and their poverty. The slow revelation of the family's background, the naturalistic interactions, the judicious spacing of shocks and surprises, are all evidence of a master filmmaker in perfect sync with his material. Throughout the entire film, Koreeda does not stand in judgement of his characters but simple observes the trajectory of their life. Even when he moves into darker territory in the film's last section, its main focus remains on the humanity of the characters. When Noboyu disposes of an item that is a painful reminder for Yuri about the family that abused her, she gives her a big hug, explaining that when people love each other, they give them hugs and do not hit them. In an exquisite moment, Yuri places her hand on Noboyu's face who lets it remain there for a few minutes. These are flawed individuals and Koreeda does not avert a critical gaze from their individual responsibility.

While Shoplifters contains elements that are painful to watch, what we take with us is Koreeda's empathy displayed in the beauty of small moments: The joy of trips to the beach and coming of age for Shota and Osamu handling it so humorously, the sharing of cold noodles on a humid summer day and the long repressed sexual intimacy that follows between partners, the expression on the faces of young children aware, perhaps for the first time, that they are loved; and the entire family listening to, but not seeing, a firework display (what a metaphor for this family's peripheral status!).

The real joy comes from the way the whole thing gels and shimmers, and provides steely insight on contemporary Japanese society, and the human condition. This sense of realism and joy in small moments of life of its characters is communicated with simple gestures like the slurping sounds of noodles as the family eats dinner together, the way they follow small cultural beliefs and give the young girl Yuri salt to lick before bed so she doesn't wet the bed in the night, or the way Grandma hits a small metallic cup in honor of her dead husband every morning and Aki introduces Yuri to her new hair and name sitting in front of the mirror. It is through such small scenes that we can see clearly, that poverty is everywhere, but you don't need money or be related by blood to be a family.

The cinematography is extraordinary, with some surprising long shots, close-ups and beautiful shots from tight angles. The editing is speechless, connecting numerous scenes just seamlessly. Not a single minute is wasted, and the film is largely intense and arresting. Together with the brilliant performances from the ensemble cast, the result is a satisfying and deeply affecting drama on lower class in Japan.

The performances are sublime and it's more of a team effort as every character completes another and ultimately form an arc that tells the story in a brilliant way. Franky Lily and Kirin Kiki both are tonally perfect here. Koreeda shows that he has a deft touch with child actors. The maturity in the performance of both the child actors, Jyo Kairi and Miyu Sasaki is stunning. Sakura Ando is outstanding as the mother-figure, made wise by her bitter experiences but also upbeat in her approach to life. Her threat to kill a minor character is chilling. One scene, where she performs straight to camera, answering a question on what her 'children' called her, rips your heart out.

Overall in a breath taking display of realism, Shoplifters tells a touching story that's seemingly simple at first sight but gets nuances to a point but the film sticks to its realism and dismantles the social norms with such grace, offering a new insight to a world unknown to most, where people long for family love and they're desperate to have someone to call family, on account of the raw emotions it conveys. The film explores big questions on living a good life and taking responsibility in an uncaring society. Shoplifters is a rare exercise of social realism and it gets its message across so elegantly making it filmmaking at its finest.

Shoplifters is a simply stunning film and must watch for all.",9.0,8 July 2020
A movie of intricacies,"In life the things that stand out are the episodic or the most lifechanging moments. Thus do we cherish or hate the change. We get to see a family who appear to have little in means yet give, of the little they have.

They help a seemingly abused small girl and this girls big change begins here. However, they all have a new additional member to get used to. This is the first phase the accustomization phase the change or changes that will effect them all. The second one is the cherish,joy and happy phase. The third phase i will not spoil.

Within a little time we somewhat understand the storyline but it is the small intricacies that intrigues and when all the small pieces come together one realises the depth of the storyline that becomes more than initially anticipated. A renewed sympathy and respect to the characters unfold within oneself. Yet with some doubt as to their prior intention, but clearly understanding their intention at this point in time. A nice mellow movie that shows how people can be a positive or negative influence and focusing on the good even when dealt a bad hand. How being good to others makes you good and not being a force of evil is the best way to act.",7.0,10 January 2020
A perfect film about a warm family in a cold society,"Koreeda, often compared with Yasujiro Ozu, in this film adopts a sort of Loach like view of the world. He treats it with the light touch of ""Raining stones"" (1993) and not with the heavy anger of ""I, Daniel Blake"" (2016). He does it perfectly.",8.0,18 August 2019
Good but not for everyone,"It's good because of the way a family is portrayed even though they're not a ""conventional"" family. The performance of the kids were great, especially the boy. The reason it's not for everyone and the reason I didn't rate it an 8 is the pace, the movie feels slow and at 2 hours quite long, although the flip side is you do develop a bond with and deeper understanding of the characters.",7.0,13 February 2019
Dissapointed,"I had high hopes for ShopLifter, given its insanely high reviews, but unfortunately, it fell flat for me. Even though the movie has some good aspects like the way it's filmed and directed, I can't figure out why it looks like it's from the 1990s when it was made in 2018. Is there a reason for this choice other than just how it looks?

People seem to really like this movie, but I don't understand what they see in it to give it such high ratings. Despite being 3/4 of the way through, the movie felt boring and didn't hold my attention. I typically enjoy dramatic films, but this one just didn't click with me, and I felt like I wasted my time watching it.

The lack of music in the movie also made it feel strange and uncomfortable. The absence of a soundtrack left a void that affected the overall experience.

If you're like me and prefer movies that are easy to watch without delving into deep meanings, I'd suggest skipping this movie. Some people compare it to the popular Korean film Parasite, but in my opinion, Parasite is far superior. Im sure to be in the minority here, but this movie just didn't click with me.",4.0,6 August 2023

"Gosh, I almost got through without mentioning the many scenes of slurping noodles - hot and cold!","The dreaded word, 'heartwarming' is the most likely to be dragged out to summarise this but it would be unfair. Director Hirokazu Koreeda is much more interested in dissecting the true meaning of 'family' than pulling at the heart strings and producing sentimental tosh. Clearly a labour of love (and concern) he produces amazingly naturalistic performances out of a varied group of actors. It is also clear that Lily Franky has become a Japanese favourite despite the only other film I have seen of his, which was his first, the 2001 low budget semi-disgrace that was Blind Beast vs Dwarf! Mind you he was probably the only good actor in that and he is perfect here as the father (figure). Those brackets are important and even more so in relation to the 'mother' and 'grandmother' seen here as some sort of modern day saviours (or villains according to the police and accepted standards of morality). Mention must be made of the incredible performance of Miyu Sasaki who looks no more than four or five. Again, I assume we must look to the director as to just how such a remarkable performance was achieved. Apart from the serious question of 'real' mothers and what is best for children this film will be an eye-opener for those who know little of Japan or have just visited on a controlled tour. Here is the gritty underbelly, sex workers, day workers, pachinko parlours and seven elevens in all their tawdry glory. Plus a sample of the delightful weather, thunderstorms, snow storms and insufferable heat. But it is not all bad and without resorting to using the 'h' word I would say that this does paint a picture of a people dedicated to helping each other where possible and contriving to live under the most crowded of conditions. Gosh, I almost got through without mentioning the many scenes of slurping noodles - hot and cold! Minimal story but masterful direction of this (very) close knit family is bound to hold your attention.",8.0,11 December 2018
"A poignant, deeply affecting and thought provoking","Shoplifters is a beautiful movie about what it truly means to be a family. The central theme being that the bonds we forge is thicker than what is thrust upon us. It's the kind of 'slice of life' which makes you wonder about your own life. It's poignant, it's beautiful, it's deeply affecting and it stayed with me long after.",9.0,22 February 2019
A Superior Experience the Second Time Around,"Shoplifters was a superior experience the second time around. I was able to understand the family dynamics much better and the story made much more sense. For whatever reason, the food scenes did not annoy me as much and I felt much more emotion.

Key moments include the rekindling of the relationship between Nobuyo and Osamu, the saving of Yuri from abusive parents, the building of a snowman and the beach scene (no, not the one from Roma haha).

I still have an issue with Aki's subplot as a sex worker. It just felt really out of place and kind of random. It takes up about five minutes of the film, and it really kind of makes the feel out of focus. If that part was removed, the film would easily be a 4.5/5 (9/10).

With a wonderful score, detailed set designs, amazing acting from all of the cast, and a beautiful story about the true meaning of family, Shoplifters is a great film, even if I disagree with it winning the Palm d'Or!",,14 December 2018

Emotional ride,"A very understated movie, with a story that leaves you thinking about it for a while even after the credits roll. This is due mainly to some great performances (although I do feel a bit of the lines and performances is lost in translation), with the child actors really standing out. The pacing is slow but deliberate, creeping along leaving you enough time to really take the story in. Other highlights are some nice and memorable set pieces and poignant photography. The story ends up being a bit too complicated to follow while watching but seems worth the follow up. Could have been more compact but definitely worth a watch.

Story is simple a family with many problems both social and economic wise who live on the margins of Tokyo, are simply a band of outsiders and rebel like renegades who all unite and love and work together by shoplifting just to get by and eat and make ends meet. As each know how to con and play the game of life. However things change when the family takes in a child from out in the cold, and more matters are complicated when their young son is arrested and caught which brings plenty to the airwaves.

"Contemplative, perhaps, is the best way to describe it","'Shoplifters' notably won the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year, the first Japanese film to do so since 1997's 'The Eel.' It has since gone on to win 11 other awards and was recently nominated by the Golden Globes for Best Foreign Language Motion Picture.

The merit for all these accolades isn't immediately apparent to audiences when initially delving into the picture, which features a small but close-knit family unit reliant on shoplifting and other petty crimes to survive.

However, the film becomes more and more engrossing as the ties that bond the characters together are further tested and examined. Additionally, since domestic audiences aren't familiar with the actors, it lends an incredible amount of authenticity to their roles, further amplified by writer/director Hirokazu Koreeda's impeccable camera placement.

In the end, this isn't a film that leaves you either exhilarated or exhausted when exiting the theater. Contemplative, perhaps, is the best way to describe it, lingering well beyond when the other emotions have already faded away.",8.0,12 December 2018
Good Enough,"The story of shoplifters is a simple, yet complicated one. The family, even though they shoplift, obviously breaking the law by doing so, they maybe have found the secret in what makes a family. One of the key factors of this movie were the performances. Even the kids were really good, though some characters were explored in depth as others. The plot, moreover, although it started slowly, it presented the family nicely and it solved all the mysteries in the ending, so it wasn't left open, although the last scene did raise some questions.

Onetime watch.....?,"A group of misfits (to the society) live together in poverty as a family in Tokyo. They resort to whatever means they have to resort to, including petty thefts, to make ends meet. The young son is arrested and that leads to the under-the-radar secrets of the family.

---- The main theme of this movie is that family doesn't have to be biological. Love and support for one another is what matters. It's a joyous-family-story with various tragic layers underneath that you slowly get to. It explores ""What is a family?"" ""What makes a family?"" The acting was really good, especially the kids in the movie. I liked how they had just enough screen time for all the characters to make you like/feel for them (even though, in a real life society, they'd be hated upon), something that most movies don't do even with a couple of main roles.

I found the movie to be slow for my liking, but maybe that's just me. I usually watch edge-of-the-seat movies. While the intensity of movie doesn't change much, the tone does, it gets dark. Of course, the movie also touches upon the society and the rules that leads people to fall into such poverty and keep them there.

At the heart of it, it's a story and a reminder that even the ones that are looked down upon by the society could demonstrate love and support. Do check it out!",7.0,17 August 2023

What makes a family? what makes a mother?,"""Shoplifters"" (2018 release from Japan; 121 min.) brings the story of a family on the edge of society. As the movie opens, we see a man (Osamu) and his son (maybe 11-12 yrs. old) in a busy grocery store, and they are working with each other to steal various groceries. On the way home, they find a 5 yr. old girl who seems to be locked out or abandoned. Osamu decides to take the little girl with them. When they arrive home, it is an incredibly small place (2 small rooms) that houses 5 people altogether (not counting the little girl). Upon closer examination of the young girl's arms, it is clear that she has been beaten, mistreated, and/or worse. Still Osamu and his wife decide to return the girl, but when they hear the girl's parents in an all-out domestic dispute, they decide to keep the little girl a while longer... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest from Japanese writer-director Hirokazu Kore-eda, who previously brought us such great films as 2013's ""Like Father, Like Son"". Here he examines one particular family that is struggling mightily to keep things together financially, and hence resorts to shoplifting groceries and other necessities of life. The arrival of the little girl causes even more adjusting and yes, also tension, but it brings us to the heart of the matter in this film: what makes a family? and what makes a mother? The director, bless his heart, makes frequent use of long takes, where he simply lets the scene develop and it's almost like he is (and by extension, we are) simply observing and taking it in. Furthermore, the movie teaches us to not just assume things, and instead to gather all the facts before we come to any (nuanced) conclusions. The acting performances are top-notch. I picked up only one geographical reference in the entire movie (somebody mentions the Sumida river) that confirms the movie in fact does take place in Tokyo.

The movie premiered at the 2018 Cannes film festival, and promptly won the festival's top honors (Palme d'Or). Then last week it picked up a well-deserved nomination for the Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar. Alas, it is up against ""Roma"" in that category, which for me was the best movie of 2018, period (it got 10 Oscar nominations in total), so I can't see ""Shoplifters"" win that Oscar. But don't let that deter you for one minute not to see this. I saw it this past weekend at the theater, and the Saturday early evening screening was PACKED, I am happy to report (I'm guessing the miserable weather may have helped in that regard). If you like a top-notch foreign movie that brings a nuanced character study of a struggling family, I'd readily suggest you seek this out, be it in the theater (if you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion",9.0,28 January 2019

As I watched this with fellow TMM reviewer Karl, he and I both made comments that this movie reminded us of the films of Edward Yang (""Yi Yi"", ""A Brighter Summer Day""), and any movie that draws comparison to Yang is one that deserves attention. This film is simple in its premise; really, it's all about getting to know these characters and watching their way of life. The brilliance of this film comes from Koreeda's writing, which slowly peels back layers of each character, revealing more and more through every scene. Every tiny revelation seemed to draw me in further to these people: they're some of the most well developed characters I've seen on screen in some time. Each character has their own flaws; deep and meaningful back story, and a lesson that they learn through their time in this story. Not one scene is wasted.

I think really what drew me into this story the most was the compassion with which all of the characters treat each other. Every decision characters make is driven by a want to make someone else's life better; even the decisions that might seem wrong or at times disturbing, when viewed through the eyes of our family, makes sense when you think about how they're used to trying to survive. These people are fighting to be together because they truly believe that they're each other's best hope. While this film isn't exactly about happy things, the way that it is approached is so unbelievably optimistic; even in all these hardships there can be joy and hope. I feel like that message alone makes this movie worth watching.

This movie broke me...,"Shoplifters (written and directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda) is 2018's one of the best rated movies on Metascore and that is one of the main reasons I ended up watching it yesterday. Oh boy, what a movie it is!

The movie shows a poor but loving/happy family living together in a very small house - consisting of a grandma, parents, a son, wife's sister and a little girl. They mostly depend on shoplifting to make ends meet and sometimes work together to collect the items they would need on daily basis. They come across a stranded little girl who might have died if they had not taken her in. They all form an immediate bond with her and start taking care of her collectively.

Some specific events unfold leading to some scary and disturbing revelations of every character in this movie. Some details were shown and some were implied. Each detail, while extremely disturbing, reveals the inadequacies in today's society and how blind/ignorant some of the seemingly composed people can get. These issues are deep-rooted in our society and there is no simple solution for such issues. We can probably acknowledge them or, in some way, try to fight them but this seems to be an everlasting war. And how is this all ever the kids' fault who are probably get most affected by everything that goes around them? These little kids are building memories everyday and we all have to be very careful with what they observe and take in.

JIM'S REVIEW: The talented Hirokazu Kore-eda directed, wrote, and edited his critical acclaimed family drama, Shoplifters. This Japanese foreign film tells the story of a family living in poverty and using any means possible to survive, including theft, sexual prostitution, and kidnapping.

Osamu (Lily Franky) is essentially an updated version of Fagin with a heart. He works in a low-paying job as a laborer and teaches his adopted son, Shoto (Kairi Jo), to shoplift with pride just to make ends meet. However, Shoto has a moral conscience and begins to doubt this behavior as the norm. Also in this family unit are Osamu's wife, Nobuyo (Sakura Ando), a factory worker who is the family overseer, Aki (Mayu Matsuoka), who works at a sex hostess club, and Hatsue (Kirin Kiki), the elderly grandmother and widow who owns the house where everyone lives. One night, Osamu and Nobuyo discover a little abandoned girl named Yuri (Miyu Sasaki) who they discover is being abused by her natural parents and decide to save her. What was once a family of five becomes six.

No, this is not your typical modern family and the narrative, while always compelling, needs more definition in its multiple characters, their actions, and their relationships within the family dynamics. A few rewrites could have clarified situations. Add to that, the film has major pacing issues, becoming far too slow-moving. Some scenes just do nothing to advance the plot, having quite the opposite effect.

But there are many powerful moments that honestly deal directly with the socio-economic issues and our evolving idea of the nuclear family. Mr. Kore-eda examines this notion of family and our expected roles which intrinsically cause repercussions on each individual member. The director creates vivid images throughout the film. Its quieter sequences establish a sudden poignancy and pathos that allows his story to resonate (a melting snowman that was symbolic of a father-son bonding, a mother saying a final good-bye to her child, a old woman evaluating her long life, etc.). He also does not shy away from the harsh effects caused by poverty which continually traps and gnaws at its victims.

The acting is uniformly strong. Especially memorable are Ms. Ando who brings such beautiful nuances to her strong maternal character and Ms. Kiki, in her last film performance, adding a special charm to her role as the cunning patriarch. Both of their final scenes are quite moving. The child actors give believable and natural performances that truly enhance the drama.

Shoplifters has its flaws, but its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. Steal some time to see this worthwhile film.",8.0,27 January 2019
Are people trying to downvote this just for the sake of it?,"Look at some of the reviews really. What in the he!! is wrong with people?

This was such a stark depiction of poverty and how when you're on the street, you choose your family. I felt that the ending was very mild which kinda suits the tone of the whole movie but even yet, I was left dissatisfied. But the first half of the movie and the way they take in the girl, is so freaking beautiful.

I don't think I've cried this hard in a long time than when the scene of the 'mother' and the 'daughter' burning her dress. These are the kind of moments which are so subtle yet ping you so so so bad. I still don't get the hate of these reviewers.",8.0,2 January 2020
Lack of Focus Causes a Lack of Investment and Attachment to the Characters,"Shoplifters is the next film from Hirokazu Koreeda, who directed of one of my favorite foreign films After the Storm. Despite the acclaim that this director has under his built, I definitely struggled with this film. Although I was never really bored, I was certainly confused. Whether it was the family dynamics that kind of boggled my mind to the random vignettes of characters that were never brought up again or the lack of focus in the narrative, I was confused what I was supposed to feel. I am serious when I same the family dynamics really made no sense at first. By the end of it, I finally understood it, but I was just really wondering who was related to each other throughout the whole film.

Many describe the film as a family drama showcasing a low-income family who lives crowded in a home together, but everything changes when they rescue an abandoned girl. It sounds emotional, beautiful, and heart-wrenching, but I got none of that. When I wanted to feel for the little girl who was abandoned and abused, to when I wanted to feel for the little boy, to when I wanted to see the fleshed our story of the stripper girl, to me even wanting to see the husband and wife rekindle their relationship, I got none of it.

All I got was a series of sneak peaks to these stories, and it was irritating because the stories were never fleshed out for any of these characters. The director just went from person to person, and it never really flowed coherently for me. It annoyed me because the filmmaker had the characters and he had my investment, but he never took the time to flesh them out. Ugh it was annoying.

Lastly, Japanese food is excellent I'm sure. But do we need to hear every character slurp when they eat? I wanted to slap some of these characters haha. But that is just my own issue with people who chew loudly.

I will be sure to rewatch this film next week with, Burning but even if I like it more the next time, this definitely did not deserve the Palm D'Ore.

Finally, this film is by no means bad, but I wish I cared more for what was going on throughout the film and actually have an emotional experience like most people are having.",,3 December 2018
"Unexpectedly good acting and a very thoughtful story, albeit a bit dramatic","If you want to see a Japanese live action adaptation after some manga, this is not the film for you. This is the kind of movie about poor desperate souls living on the outskirts of society and still being human. It's something that I am accustomed to, as it seems the entire Romanian cinematography can only be about that. It was a bit unexpected for a Japanese film, though, to see an exploration of small time crooks, living outside society, almost a taboo in the little I know about that culture, and them being presented as very human and having beautiful souls.

The plot is really unimportant, as the quality of the film is all about the details: great acting, attention to the little gestures, the subtle emotions and so on. It's an exploration of culture as a whole, not just the Japanese one, so in a way this is a very international film. Yet prepare yourselves for two hours of slow exposition of normal life. The movie is at the same time boring and wonderful and probably it takes one to be in a certain mood to fully appreciate it.

Bottom line: Good acting, even from the very young, and a slow exploration of people's souls while they are living their miserable lives.",8.0,29 March 2019

Very good display of the reality of this Asian Class,"I resonated so much with this movie. I felt as if I was watching my ancestors life play right in front of me. The whole concept of being so active and close to a child, is what the current Asian cultures have lost because of culture changes. I feel the demographic that the world is revolved around, the internet, has caused a great social disruption on the health of family cultures and values in Asia. Asian families are being more distant and rebellious against their family, which causes a great strain on the culture, and the government as a whole. The people fo the Asian countries are still being put out there as a conformed cultured people, but the people are more disruptive than they have ever been in history. What is also so real about this movie is the experience that the movie allows you to have. The movie does a very good job at showing the struggles of the vast majority of the people in the Asian countries, but the movie does hide the reality of the more traumatic and the slum image of the people of the community that this movie is alluding too. It's understandable why they do this, and if you don't know, it's because it allows the government to have better control of these people, because then it allows the government to have a standard where this specific community can strive to accomplish. This community that these people are living I this movie, are more reputable than most people are in the country. These are more so around the lower middle class people in the Asian countries. Nonetheless the movie was great.",10.0,28 February 2019

"""Quiet"", but also meaningful and emotional Japanese family drama","This is a great and emotional, although a bit sad drama about a family in which parents have part-time jobs that compel them to turn to shoplifting, who ""adopt"" a young girl, whose parents neglect her. We get to see the formers' everyday life, and finally realize they are more than just a family of shoplifters. Humanitarian director Hirokazu Koreeda manages to extract fantastic performances from the whole cast, and digs into the reasons why somebody would turn into shoplifting and generally illegal acts. The film itself neither excuses the family nor criticizes it. It just shows how hard is to be moral in an immoral world, and that sometimes truly unethical acts and people remain unpunished. We watch how companies and even the state could be responsible for the downfall and turn to crime of citizens (particularly the ones who live in poverty), as well. Concerning the more hopeful and enjoyable moments of the film, we observe the bond that's slowly created between the family and the young girl (and especially the young boy's efforts to bond with the new member of the family), how the adults (and the children) take care of young Yuri, and the more playful and intimate time the members of the family pass with each other. There are also valuable messages about what love is and how is this emotion expressed, and that even a family of outsiders can be loving. I recommend it as an introduction to Japanese cinema and also to the ones who want to see a touching but not schmaltzy family drama, without razzle-dazzle and exaggerated performances, that makes it to be deeply humanistic.",9.0,10 September 2023

Great movie!,"I strongly recommend ""Shoplifters""... You can learn so much about human living from this simple relationships",10.0,3 March 2019
Actually quite enjoyable,"This film is a minimalist and intimate puzzle about the nature of family. The story revolves around a stripped down cast of characters with meager posessions. This serves a stylistic purpose, but it also removes distractions from a plot that chooses its words carefully and thus ensures that the story does not get lost in a web of ""stuff"".

While some reviews characterize the film, or just its ending, as sad, I did not find that to be the case. The ending is meditative, and ultimately leaves the viewer to consider a poignant but muted exchange between the Grandma and Nobuyo Shibata (played by Sakura Ando, who in my mind could have warranted an oscar nomination for this incredible performance). During a walk, Nobuyo muses that maybe the bond is more powerful if a former stranger chooses to be a member of a family. Hatsue (aka Grandma) responds that it ""will not last.""

I found myself reflecting on this conversation throughout the film and especially at the end. You can understand much of the two characters' behaviors through the lens with which they viewed family. In fact, much of the relationships in the film exist in pairings which to me pose this question over and over again and dissect the question from different but related angles: What is the meaning of family? Is it worth anything? Is it stronger if chosen? What is parenting? What do ""father"" and ""mother"" represent? How does one show love and intimacy?

These are powerful questions delicately posed and thoughtfully rendered. If the director felt there was a clear answer, he was not heavy handed in his execution. I think the ending is actually quite hopeful on this wider question, even if some of the individual characters' fortunes may seem a bit melancholy. These material setbacks, to me, seem less consequential, and one can savor the greater war that was won in demonstrating humanity's capacity to construct a deeply fulfilling bond by choice, even amidst scarcity and depravation. I found this quiet battle of flawed, unlikely soldiers quite inspiring indeed.",8.0,31 December 2021
Masterpiece,"Not enough words in the english language to describe this... Describes the family institution, society as an institution, and the consequences of these two in what we call their continuity.

The main idea that in a society, we should be able to choose our family many times explicitly expressed in this movie. This idea produces many other implications which can change the fabric of society. But in the real world, this is not the case. In the real world the above institutions reproduce themselves in a orderly and strict way and people pertain to this way of life because of the selfish gene which is very powerful in human beings...",10.0,23 February 2022
Shoplifters: A Heartwarming and Heartwrenching Tale of Family and Belonging,"In Shoplifters, we follow the daily struggles of the poor and unconventional Shibata family, who live in a cramped and rundown apartment in Tokyo. The family makes ends meet by engaging in petty crimes and scams, and they rely on each other for support and love.

One day, they come across a young girl who has been abandoned by her parents and is living on the streets. Despite their limited resources, the Shibatas decide to take her in and care for her, and they begin to form a close bond with her.

As the film progresses, we see the Shibatas struggle with their own personal issues and challenges, and we also see them come together as a family to support and protect each other. The film explores themes of family, love, and belonging in a way that is both heartwarming and heartwrenching, and it is a powerful exploration of the human condition.

The acting in Shoplifters is superb, with standout performances from the entire cast. The young girl, played by actress Sakura Ando, is particularly impressive, and the chemistry between the actors feels authentic and genuine. The cinematography is also excellent, with beautiful shots that perfectly capture the mood and tone of the film.

Overall, Shoplifters is a poignant and thought-provoking film that is not to be missed. It is a powerful exploration of family and the human condition, and it is also a moving and emotional story that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Highly recommended.",10.0,5 January 2023
lovely and touching movie about the meaning of family,"The story is touching and will grab your heart, and the acting is terrific. I was hooked on reading when my 2nd grade teacher gave me The Boxcar Children, and this movie is a modern Japanese version--about people who protect their humanity by living below the radar. Japanese film has a ""lower depths"" tradition, but this one is much warmer and more engaging than any previous movie about ""outsiders.""

The last scene of the the life of the two children changed forever by the love, care and everything they saw and learned from the family (not the blood one). Loyality above everything.

Extended family,"Korean drama movies as well as their thrillers are really good. Well made but also really intriguing stories to boost the whole experience. In this case you have an extended family who as the english title suggests are into shoplifting. And while it was a bit strange to watch their routine when they were introduced, it quickly becomes clear that this is more than just about stealing.

Although there could be a pun in this. Especially considering how they find a new member of their family and how they get that member involved in their activities. Of course there is a lot happening and the relationships between the characters are quite something. This feels as real as possible (have not checked if certain things were based on real life but would make sense) to say the least. Great drama, great story",9.0,25 February 2021

Watch out Roma--Shoplifters is lookikng at Oscar.,"Hatsue Shibata: I was sure she'd want to go home. Nobuyo Shibata: Do you think she... chose us? Hatsue Shibata: Usually you can't choose your own parents. Nobuyo Shibata: But then, maybe it's stronger when you choose them yourself.

After these demanding holidays, consider what ""family"" means. Regardless of your definition, Hirokazu Kore-eda' s Shoplifters will help define at least ""extended family."" This Japanese dramedy defines love as a central ingredient of family, despite the fragmented, sometimes tumultuous, little world of adults and kids occupying a small Japanese-style hoe, where most of what you see strewn around has been stolen from unsuspecting merchants and naifs prone to believing grifters.

Despite the formal nature of the film, romance is tucked away in heretofore unsuspecting corners such as everyone's love for and dependence on a 'Grandma"" (Kirin Kiki), like others in this family not blood related but bound by affection and needs to be fulfilled through the small community. After Grandma's support, the other major source of funds appears to be outright shoplifting, facility by children savvy and innocent enough to win our hearts and never lose them.

Is this story funny? Yes. Is it eventually tragic? Yes. Do we love the characters anyway? Yes. Will this small film, winner of the Cannes' Palm d'Or, give jitters to the accepted foreign language Oscar competitors Roma and Burning? Yes. Should you see it with your family and expand your understanding of what family means? A resounding Yes!",,5 January 2019

I sat, spellbound, for the entire length of the film and, even though some of the characters are pretty sketchy (in terms of morality), you find yourself rooting for them.

A personal and nuanced film asking questions without easy answers,"Shoplifters deserves all the hype it's gotten as one of the strong, smart films of 2018. It's a slow burn that seems to just be a simple portrait of a family, but then really opens your eyes in the last half hour and forces you to reexamine your beliefs about the characters. Some scenes seem isolated or not adding anything to the overall plot, but the more I mull the film over, the more I see small connections between scenes and the need to develop the characters as Kore-eda did. The last half hour of the film is shocking and exciting, and at the heart of it all is the question: what makes a family? Kore-eda doesn't give us a single simple, one-dimensional character - each is fascinating and flawed in realistic ways. I am still wrestling with the morality of the ""family""'s actions. They were caring to the kids and perhaps did their best living on the fringes of society, and it's very hard to not sympathize with them. On the other hand, you do see the manipulative side of them come out on numerous occasions. Shota is a fascinating character as someone who clearly cares deeply for the family but also becomes uneasy with the morality of their stealing, and eventually it's too much for him. The themes and ideas will stay with me for a while, and I only wish more people would watch this movie and engage with it, because it does not disappoint.",8.0,6 May 2019

the film play on all strings of human emotions, and was at times hard to watch. the acting are at times overwhelming, especially by the mum and dad in this den of thieves. its like a modern version of oliver twist by charles dickens, where children are molested,thrown away,unloved, making other grown ups to take advantage and carrying on like pseudoparents.

the filmatic impression are very good, it tells a great part of the story with good colors and very nice glow in the lightsettings., i could not find any glitch in the editing,and the pace and length of the film are perfect.

as im not related to the japanese language i miss alot of the depth in the dialouges, but the cc's were good. to summarize it i can say that its not a comedy, more an overall survival drama , and i guess this film is quite revolutionary in its kind in japanese cinemas. its a guess from the grumpy old man that had a good time watching manbiki kazoku.highly recommended",9.0,12 February 2019
Forged by Circumstance: Society's Unlikely Family,"""Shoplifters"" is a captivating and thought-provoking film that explores the complexities of families and the unexpected bonds that can emerge from unlikely circumstances. It talks about a non-traditional family living on the fringes of society, challenging societal norms and shedding light on the complexities of love and belonging.

The performances in ""Shoplifters"" are exceptional, especially the lead actress, with every actor bringing a depth of emotion and authenticity to their roles. The chemistry among the ensemble cast is palpable, capturing the intimacy and genuine connections that form within the non-traditional family. Their performances anchor the film, imbuing it with a sense of realism and empathy that allows the audience to fully invest in their lives and struggles.

The film's final revelation, exposing the family's darker nature, serves as a powerful twist that adds depth to the overall narrative. It prompts reflection on the nature of human behavior and the complexities of familial relationships. While unsettling, this ending offers a thought-provoking conclusion that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.

Shoplifters,"A genuinely super film about a family of small time chancers who survive on their wits on the verge of poverty. There is something almost Fagin-esque about their behaviour, but in best Robin Hood tradition we always feel that their small-scale criminal activities are carried out as a result of necessity than from any need or wish to do anyone else any harm. They take in a little girl off the street which stretches their already meagre resources but without rancour or complaint and we skip through a series of events, some beautifully poignant some rather more serious. The contrast between the three generations of the ""Shibata"" family living in a space no bigger than an average garage compared with some of the wealth and Japanese opulence surrounding them is expertly delivered by a strong cast - especially the youngsters - under the careful direction of Hirozaku Koreeda - and makes for a thought-provoking two hours of cinema.",8.0,30 May 2024

It worms your heart like a firework,"Simple yet honest and charming, Shoplifters is one of the best films of the year. This film talks to the heart through its grounded story, its lovable and human characters and its sweet cinematography. The parents love their family, but they are able to take for their children only by learning shoplifting. They also take under their wings a young girl who is treated in a mean way by her parents. The reason why this film works so much , is because it avoids the cliches and never feels too much and cheesy. Under the sweetness, lies a true sense of consequence and that's why it feels so realistic and powerful. The society will never understand true love and what's best for everyone. They will always jujde someone by looking at his/hers past and never appreciate those people who care and fight with love for the best. Truly profound. Its beauty lie in its small moments. The conversation between father and son about the son's sexuality and human desire, the diner scenes, a girl hugging one of her customers and feeling his pain and his want to be loved. We all crave for love and when we find people who can provide it to us, we feel blessed. But even if they leave from our lives for a while. they still love us and we still love them. Friends and family are like stars. We might not see them, but we know that they are there. Beautiful film with a heart 8/10",8.0,5 February 2019

Heartbreaking and Heartwarming at the same time,"I have wanted to see this film for a long time, not only because of the high praise it received, but mainly because it touched a very sensitive subject. That of poverty and petty crime in Japan- but it really could have been anywhere in the world. At least that is what I thought. In truth, the poverty and the petty crime are just the setting, in order for the main underlying message to come to the surface.

This is a touching movie about human relations, about a dysfunctional group of mainly non related people, who, by chance and/or choice come together at a certain point in life and try to make ends meet, while bonding as a real family would. The bottom line? Sometimes, the family you choose is better than your biological family, even if you do shady things collectively in order to survive. Perhaps, because you do shady things, the bonds strengthen.

All the characters, while on a first glance dubious and opportunistic, quickly became very sympathetic and I could honestly feel the connection they cultivated, the love that they had for each other, even if they didn't admit it openly. The cast shone in their respective roles- especially the Mother, Father and the Boy. There are some extremely poignant scenes- the one with the fireworks comes to mind immediately- scenes that blatantly show that even if they are situated at the very bottom of society, they can still be happy and optimistic.

It is a very realistic movie, very well directed and acted and it gave me a different perspective of things I take for granted in life. I wholeheartedly recommend it.",8.0,6 July 2019
"It's not about choosing your family, but in the way you're offered that choice...","I'm not sure I got all the implications of that big reveal at the end of ""Shoplifters"" and I'm not sure it did matter for writer and director Kore-eda to have us 'get' everything (if I dare make a bold assumption). Or let me explain this, what struck me in that film is that no matter how morally corrupt Osamu (Lily Franky) and Nobuyo Shibata (Sakura Ando) have been in this shady past of theirs, they did love and care for the children they had, and I use 'have' for the plot convenience of that word.

Kore-eda made a personal hymn to Family that comes after a streak of movies I haven't seen and so I can only base my appreciation on what he said in a behind-the-scenes interview: ""Shoplifters"" was made after the loss of his mother, an event that entirely reshaped his perception of family and prompted him to make a family story where it's not about blood ties but something that goes beyond and runs just as deep. You can't really intellectualize that and cinema is a visual medium so let's just illustrate it through one of the film's most memorable and certainly the most poignant and moving moment.

Some context is necessary. In the beginning, Osamu and his boy Shota (Jyo Kairi) finds Yuri (Jyo Kairi) a tiny little girl lost in the neighborhood, she's got a family but she's visibly distraught. Her parents aren't exactly looking for her and it's cold outside. What the Shibatas do is what any natural family would do. Take her to their home. Or maybe they would take them to the police, wouldn't they? Hence the necessity to introduce the father and the son as a shoplifting duo in the opening. Maybe. I don't know what I'd do instead, but I'm sure there's a limit to emergency and I wouldn't have kept the girl more than a night and the day after, she would have been given to local authorities.

But the Shibatas choose to keep the girl, she's skinny, doesn't take much space and she's a cute little thing who brings her own innocent presence in a family of street-smart and cynical outcasts. Eventually, they adopt her and there's that beautiful moment where Nobuyo and Juro are warming up by a fire and Nobuyo is holding Yuri tight in her arms, wishing she could call her ""mom"". But gestures speak louder and more tenderly than words and as the hugging resumes and obviously Yuri wants also to display some tenderness, I was moved by the tears of Nabuyo who was tasting that moment like a candy from heaven. This is a mother in the sense that she's capable to give that love, but she's not in the sense that she hasn't children of her own. Or she couldn't have any.

""Shoplfiters"" is like that, about people who take what they can't get, and there's a sordid parallel between the fact that they shoplift grocery products and that the whole family structure is built on the same serve-yourself pattern. Nabuyo doesn't have a daughter but she took Yuri and since the love is mutual, that's it. There's an interesting moment where she says to the grandmother ""the family you chose is more important than the one you have"", while there's a bit of hypocrisy behind that statement (does the child have a choice?) the film somehow works as a hymn for adoption. But Kore-eda doesn't sugarcoat the material and never misses an opportunity to remind us that they're still criminals, petty ones but still.

I don't know exactly what the deal was with the granny (Kirin Kiki) and her relationship with Aki (Matsu Mayuoaka) the young woman whom I couldn't identify as Shota's or Nabuya's sister but I have a feeling that the more I process it, the more likely I'm going to spoil that pretty little family portrait, whose momentum is reached by the sight of the five members on the beach playing with the waves, the movie poster. Not only is this image beautiful but it's the smile that it elicits on the granny's face that sells it, one of these faces that say ""I can die now"". Well she doesn't die right away after that.

Through"" Shoplifters"", Kore-eda paints a delicate picture where the beautiful and the sordid meet, we see a family crowded in a shady place, the boy sleeps in a cupboard, and we see him and Yuri running together under the rain. The Dad is teaching fishing or magic tricks and the young girl is working in some weird peep shows to make ends meet and the couple are having sex and an aftermath many adults would relate to. Kore-eda leaves us with mixed feelings, we're not totally inclined to condemn the parents but we know they're guilty of the lives they led, their actions and the carelessness with which they handled their family life. It's not a moral film, but a commentary on the need for a family and some bonds that start as artificial, even illegal, but that grow and blossom into true love with the passing of time.

There's a moment at the end when we get the feeling one of the victims is determined to leave that part and move forward but then, something happens that shows that you can totally ignore the good, even in bad people. For what's it's noble intentions, ""Shoplifters"" tend to drag on at times and I'm not sure I loved the way poor little Yuri ended but I guess closure can't be satisfying for everyone, or it would be a fairy tale. There's also some confusion on the way the father got away from the police but as I said, it doesn't really matter.

The film touched me, deeply at times, there was a fine balance of amusement and shock that Kore-eda didn't overplay, it's a fitting Golden Palm winner and a smooth appetizer before the more shocking ""Parasite"".",8.0,2 October 2022
"A Thoughtful, Provoking yet Heartfelt Japanese Cinema","Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda's latest feature film ""Shoplifters"" focuses on the story of a lower-class ""family"" who commits petty theft to make ends meet. The film moves slowly to explore the struggles of each character which is filled with social comments but without being too melodramatic. Shoplifters can be extraordinary because of a well-written script, sophisticated directing, and brilliant performances by the actors. This film is very capable of capturing the harsh reality experienced by one of the strongest economic countries where invisible poverty still exists. Shoplifters so confidently make the audience feel warm, heart-wrenching but also entertained at the same time. It is an absolute achievement for the film to win the Palme d'Or at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.",9.0,5 August 2023
Poetic black dramacomedy about family,The way the story infolds is so clever and the actors sublime. I find it the absolute richest film from 2018.,9.0,19 January 2019
Embracing the Unseen Family: A Tender Look at 'Shoplifters',"""Shoplifters,"" Hirokazu Kore-eda's Palme d'Or-winning film, is a masterful tapestry of the human condition, woven with threads of moral complexity and tender observation. It is a film that defies the conventional boundaries of family drama, inviting us to redefine what it means to be connected by blood or bound by love.

Kore-eda, a filmmaker of profound sensitivity, crafts a narrative that is as much about the art of survival as it is about the survival of art. The Shibata family, a group of societal castaways living on the fringes of Tokyo, are shoplifters not out of greed but necessity. Their thefts are small acts of rebellion against a world that has forgotten them, each item taken a symbol of their quiet defiance.

The film opens with a sequence that is both mundane and mesmerizing: a father and son, Osamu and Shota, executing a theft with the precision of a ballet. It's a dance they know well, and Kore-eda's camera captures it with a grace that elevates their crime into something approaching poetry.

As we delve deeper into the lives of the Shibatas, we find a family stitched together by circumstance rather than genetics. Yet the affection they share is palpable, their interactions imbued with a warmth that many 'legitimate' families might envy. Kore-eda's lens is unflinching yet compassionate, finding beauty in the imperfections of his characters and their surroundings.

The performances are nothing short of revelatory. Lily Franky's Osamu is a man of gentle spirit and quiet dignity, while Sakura Ando's Nobuyo is a study in resilience. The children, too, deliver performances of remarkable authenticity, particularly Kairi Jyo as Shota, whose eyes reflect a wisdom far beyond his years.

Kore-eda's script is a marvel of economy, each line of dialogue heavy with unspoken truths. The Shibatas speak in a language of stolen glances and half-finished sentences, their communication a subtle dance as intricate as their shoplifting.

The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the audience to inhabit the world of the Shibatas fully. This is not a film that rushes towards its conclusion but rather one that savors the journey, inviting us to linger in moments of quiet contemplation.

The film's deliberate pace may test the patience of some viewers, and its subtlety can occasionally veer into ambiguity. There are moments where the narrative thread seems to fray, leaving us to wonder if Kore-eda has sacrificed clarity for the sake of artistic expression.

The film's resolution, while emotionally resonant, may leave some questions unanswered. The Shibatas' fate is left somewhat open-ended, a choice that is both brave and frustrating. It is as if Kore-eda is challenging us to find closure within ourselves, a task that is not always welcome.

""Shoplifters"" is a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits have rolled. It is a poignant exploration of what it means to choose one's family, to find kinship in the most unlikely of places. Kore-eda has crafted a work that is both deeply Japanese and universally human, a film that deserves to be cherished and debated in equal measure.

In a world that often feels bereft of kindness, ""Shoplifters"" is a reminder that humanity can be found in the smallest of gestures, the quietest of moments. It is a film that does not shout its truths but whispers them, leaving us to lean in closer, to listen, and to learn. And perhaps, in its gentle way, it teaches us that the act of theft can sometimes be an act of grace.",9.0,7 May 2024
Asks some pertinent questions!,"I'm not sure if this is just me, or if this is akin to General Consensus, but I didn't like the ending.

Although I'm not questioning how it arrived at its conclusion, but the narrative, I believe, demanded something different entirely.

Notwithstanding its somewhat underwhelming denouement, the movie is without a doubt a fascinating watch. The tale here confronts the very foundation of parenthood; the story dares to question the mundane definitions of lineage and family, as well as what it actually takes to be a parent for a child.

What exactly do you mean by ""father""? Who could be called a ""mother""? Does giving birth automatically confers someone the right to be a guardian? Is it true that blood and ancestry come before all other forms of relation and rapport in this world? Is it truly necessary for a group of people to share the same blood to be considered a family? These are some of the questions raised by the film, and I applauded their efforts wholeheartedly.

And I'd also like to congratulate the entire cast, including the child actors, for their incredible performances, which further solidified the writing's inherent ambitions and desires.

Uplifting,"After a couple of films where he seemed to be threading water, Hirokazu Koreeda has come back with a genuinely great film. In many ways this is familiar territory for him - a closely observed story of an unlikely family on the fringe of society - a poor working class family who supplement their meagre wages through regular shoplifting. The father justifies it as the goods in the shop 'don't belong to anyone yet, so nobody is hurt'. This rough around the edges but open hearted family expands when they by accident end up taking in an abused little girl.

What starts out as a slice of life film gets more profound as we realised not all is as it seems - and we start to question what it even means to be 'family'. Koreeda never force-feeds his audience with what he thinks, he lets us observe and come to our own conclusions.

This really is one of his best - the only negative in the film is that the plot becomes a little contrived and didactic towards the end, and it requires a little suspension of belief. But its all carried off very well by a uniformly outstanding cast, with the usual Kore-eda mix of experience actors and newcomers.",9.0,14 April 2019

This movie was exceptionally,"We like social realism in the U.K. so it was great to see a Japanese film explore some of lifeâ(TM)s harsher realities. I also like very much the idea that family is often where you find it and in the modern world, increasingly so. The irony of this, in the film at least, is that social services which are supposedly there to help can be unwitting agents for isolation . Many things to enjoy here, including the uniformly excellent performances and understated humour.",9.0,23 April 2019
Weak 4.5 // Little moments and huge questions,"Shoplifters is a film full of little moments and huge questions - a delicate character study and a philosophical treatise on the nature of family. Like Yasujiro Ozu, one of the greatest Japanese filmmakers to have lived, Hirokazu Kore-eda has an uncanny ability to create family-centric films both small in focus and broad in scope. This is an incredibly intimate film absorbed in the minutia of human behavior that simultaneously manages to ponder the very fabric of our relationships and societal norms.

Also like the work of Ozu, Shoplifters demands patience. Kore-eda disorients the audience by dropping us into the world of these characters without expositional priming. He then slowly, expertly offers morsels of information that accumulate to reveal the true nature of this ""family"" and the morally ambiguous ways it came into being.

The questionable actions of these flawed characters loom heavy over the film, to be sure, but Kore-eda's approach is one of curiosity rather than judgment. He observes them with great empathy, injects them with humanity, and endears us to them in a beautifully naturalistic way. In the face of the troubling revelations at the film's conclusion, we feel as conflicted as Shota in trying to merge our memories of these characters we've come to care for with the cold hard facts of what they've done.

And perhaps that's the point here. Life, family, and human relationships extend so much further than those facts, or circumstance, or DNA. Kore-eda offers no easy answers to the questions he poses, but certainly gives a beautifully poignant film through which to consider them.

What makes a family?,"Spoiler free review as usual: Shoplifters has a story, but it's really just a pretext to investigate the duality of amoral benevolance and the imperfections of humans beings.

You won't find a single thread here telling you what to think or feel, as the movie moral compass is as muted as its sounds and colors. Evidently this will upset some viewers, but at the end of the day 'shoplifters' is what 'parasites' wanted to be and couldn't.",8.0,10 May 2020
Shoplifters steals your heart and uplifts your spirits through an endearing family drama.,"Director Kore-eda has done it again. Another searing family interconnected through intricate life experiences that shape their very own characteristics. To put it simply, this is a stunning piece of cinema. Heartwarming as it is thought-provoking. Social commentary as it is dramatic. Entrancing as it is contemplating. It acts as another pillar of excellence within Asian cinema, cementing the industry as one of the best. A poverty-stricken family regularly steal products from shops through an ornate method of hand gestures. One night they encounter a young girl locked outside of her house, to which they decide to bring her back for the night so she doesn't freeze, ultimately realising that she succumbs to abuse. They decide to keep her.

Kore-eda offers an honest portrayal of low-class civilians within urban Japan, having to make ends meet in order to survive. A humanistic juxtaposition of the cold neglect from socially accepted behaviour with the warm contentment from dishonesty. It raises several commentaries on poverty, morals and Japan's increasing levels in crime (particularly shoplifting).

But the most provocative message, which only comes into fruition within the third act, is the concept of motherhood. There's a poignant line that Kore-eda inserts that resonated with me almost instantly. ""It is assumed that you become a mother automatically after giving birth."" That, right there, is a summary of Shoplifters. A brutal realisation of maternal qualities that vigilantly keep families under control. Individuals can misuse power and avoid responsibilities by abusing their children, but that doesn't make them a mother. Motherhood is warmth, heart and soul. Despite Nabuyo's unfortunate situation, she and the remaining family members have their hearts in the right place. The lack of funds only acts as a diminishing plot device that crafts the claustrophobic environment they reside in.

In the end, Kore-eda's screenplay questions the idea of what makes a family, and he explores various answers through honest emotion. The clarity in characters, domestic drama and the environment, felt that it formed directly from Kore-eda's heart. Again, much like 'After The Storm', it's personal and personable. Needless to say I could go on endlessly dissecting various lines of dialogue. ""Don't make your sister do it"", ""Sometimes it's better to choose your own family"" and ""If someone hits you and tells you they are doing it because they love you, they are a liar"". This underlying sense of ownership for both material possessions and individuals, it just bursts through the screen instantaneously. Passion. That's what Kore-eda excels at. Showing passion.

The cast give outstanding performances and allow the narrative's themes to come to life. Franky and Ando were mesmerising as the adult figures within the family, guiding their children with a dishonest yet harmless approach. Ando in particular gives massive complexion to her character that really shines during the third act. Kiki, in what was her final performance, was beautiful as the matriarchal representation of grief. The children, especially Shota and ""Lin"", gave convincing performances and equalled their adult counterparts eloquently.

My only criticism would be that the character of Aki was underdeveloped and did not have enough screen time in comparison to the other family members. Scenes involving her provocative work lacked the finesse and power that the rest of the film prevailed in.

Fortunately Kore-eda's precise directing style meant that the overall tone and message never diminished. Wonderfully clean long takes that enable the characters to naturally converse with each other unedited. Ryuto's cinematography was gorgeous as well, capitalising on the flourishing urban environment. On a technical level, this film is perfect. And, the more I reflect upon its entirety, the more I want to give it the perfect rating. However, due to Aki being a forgettable character, I just can't. That does not take away from the resonating experience that Kore-eda has lovingly produced. Heartwarming, endearing and emotionally involving. Shoplifters is a work of thematic art.",9.0,29 March 2019

Amazing. Compelling naturalism is hard to come by. This cast is freakin' perfect.,"Listen, 'Roma' deserves all the accolades it's received. It is by all measure, a very well made movie. BUT, (in my opinion only) the reason it towered over 'Shoplifters' come release and awards season is: It was directed by a well established hollywood filmmaker, funded by a known America production company. Too cynical? Yeah, well... Director Kore-eda, captures humanity and nuance like few others filmmakers ever have. There is not a false note in the cast, and the movie plays so painstakingly close to real world practicality that it's ending will be both frustrating and difficult to dispute. In all, this is truly one of the greatest movies released in the last few years and with it's washed out cinema release (at least here in Australia), needs to be talked about more.",9.0,11 April 2019
What Makes A Family Family?,"Winner of Palme d'Or at 2018 Cannes Film Festival, Shoplifters is a rich, delicate & bittersweet drama that's crafted with genuine care, told with heartfelt tenderness and ruminates on what constitutes a family through a humanistic eye that doesn't judge any of its characters & their deeds.

Shoplifters concerns a group of people living together who rely on shoplifting to cope with their life of poverty. Despite barely making enough to survive, they live a seemingly happy lives but the bonds that unite them is put to the test when an unforeseen incident occurs and unearths hidden secrets.

Written & directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda, Shoplifters features a fascinating set of characters - each interesting in their own individual ways and exhibiting sufficient depth in their respective arcs - and through the little threads that unite them, he creates this semblance of a family living together under one roof.

Kore-eda's direction is calm & composed, for he allows the plot to unravel at an unhurried pace, plus the silent camerawork doesn't get in the way of the drama unfolding on screen. The first half takes us through their daily life & shoplifting sessions in a heartwarming fashion, only for the director to uproot it all later to examine what makes a family family.

While the deftly scripted characters & their dynamic with one another manage to retain a sense of intrigue throughout, there are also few stretches of slow patches that bog down the narrative, for there are moments that end up overstaying their welcome. Performances are top-notch from the entire cast, including the children who are outstanding in their given roles.

On an overall scale, Shoplifters is a touching, affecting & emotionally captivating observation of family love that chooses to focus on the brighter side rather than dwelling on its characters' hardships. Powered by poignant performances elicited under Kore-eda's controlled direction, the film may seem aimless to some but its endearing portrait of ties that can grow between unrelated people resonates for far longer than its 2 hours runtime.",,20 February 2019
