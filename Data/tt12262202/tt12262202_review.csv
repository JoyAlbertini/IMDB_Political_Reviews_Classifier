Painful - how can it get this bad?,"Take one of the most exciting and expansive fictional universes with iconic characters and storylines... then just tear it up without respect to its original mythos, lore, etc. That's the path of destruction that Disney has been on, save Andor, Rogue One, and to an extent, the Mandalorian.

It's sad because I'm sure lots of talented professionals worked on this. Tragically, the writing and acting is truly terrible. Special effects are great, but that's not enough to compensate for all its other flaws.

As a fan, I want to give it zero stars. Out of respect for the special effects artists, I'm giving 3.",3.0,10 June 2024
What happened to the $180 million it cost to film season one of The Acolyte.,"Then I've seen episode one and two of The Acolyte.

Eight episodes at $180 million or $22.5 million per episode. In terms of production, I get the impression of a cheap 80s science fiction, there was nothing here that would indicate $22.5 million per episode.

Roger Corman could have made both of these episodes in the 80s for less than $100,000 each. When I have seen the first two episodes of The Acolyte, I get a cheap feeling of a bad and cheap CW production which in recent years has often had a bad script, bad actors and a low budget.

Among the actors, Lee Jung-jae was in a class of his own, otherwise there was a lot of stiff and poor acting from some of the actors, which can often be caused by bad directing.

Plot, script and dialogue were often unforgivably bad and stupid and are totally illogical. I don't understand how it is possible to write such bad scripts as we see in some TV series and movies nowadays. Has anyone at Disney approved the script before it goes into production?

I wasn't a big fan of Ahsoka, all the senators and generals were stupid and inept to such an extent that I sided with the Empire.

However, Ahsoka was much better with better actors and it was more grandiose and magnificent with many more and better effects and seemed like a much more expensive production.",3.0,9 June 2024

So Bad I Cancelled Disney+,"The first two episodes were so bad I cancelled Disney+. The positive reviews on this have to be bots. I read a comment where they said it was like a show on CW and that was not right, Flash and Arrow are way better than what Marvel has been putting out recently. It was more like one of those shows for preteen girls they make on the Disney Channel, like Hannah Montana. I shut it off after ten minutes but then watched the whole first two episodes before deciding to get rid of Disney+.

I looked forward to seeing Carrie Anne Moss, I love her in everything I've seen her in and then it turns out she's hardly in it.

The acting and story was just terrible. The dialogue was clunky and the Jedi don't speak like humans. They're like robots. It was like a few high school kids made a movie on their iPhones.

I've been really upset with the quality of Star Wars, Marvel and Disney in recent years. They aren't listening to consumers or shareholders. It's bizarre.",1.0,12 June 2024
Complete garbage,"I tried to give this series a chance but after 3 episodes, I'm done. It's absolute hot garbage. I love Star Wars but Disney is ruining the franchise. The producer should never get another gig after this. What made anybody think people would want to watch this? Horrible acting, horrible plot that nobody will care about unless you like after school specials. So much material they could choose from and they choose to make a WB type TV show. This could be the breaking point for many Star Wars fans. I can't believe they spent 180 million on this series that only a small percentage of fans will even finish. I would give it zero stars if I could.",1.0,12 June 2024

Cultural Vandalism,"I have never left a one star review for anything before. I always think the writing and production are never bad enough to be one star.

This series completely warrants a one star.

The writing is awful. Wooden dialogue, boring characters and so far a terrible plot. The whole production looks naff.

I am open to change and new concepts. The franchise can't grow with the same stories and ideas being replayed. The Mandolorian, Ahsoka and Andor have demonstrated that you can come up with new ideas, characters and plot lines that enhance the franchise. What the producers of this series have managed to do is spend an ungodly amount of money on producing utter garbage. Episode 3 is the worst episode of any show I have ever watched. D&D must be relieved that their butchery of Game of Thrones ending is nothing compared to this.

We all want new Star Wars material. But we want it done in a way that honours the original films and captures the essence of what makes the franchise so great.

Anyone who signed off on this project should be sacked with immediate effect.",1.0,13 June 2024
Garbage,I'm a huge star wars fan and I can already tell whoever created this has no respect for the Star Wars Universe. Who said the Jedi only pull their weapons when ready to kill ? And if this girl is Sith than she is dumb to just approach one on a bar. This director us obviously misinformed and doesn't know anything about Star Wars. This show will ruin everything if it continues. It needs to be canceled. I have to write so many words to explain my distaste for this show so I will provide more. The characters are weak and none of them show Jedi traits. Let's just bring back the cartoons so we can see how Star Wars is supposed to be done.,,5 June 2024
Meh just not for me,"I found it boring I think the concept is cool. But honestly i think I'm just burnt out on Star Wars to many spin offs. Kind of reminds me of mando season three it looked good at first but it's not as great. I found the characters too fine but very forgettable. Assassin lad is pretty cool and the Jedi were also pretty cool but overall just boring. I don't hate Star Wars, but maybe it's time for me to start looking for new stuff to watch. Honestly, Star Wars has kind of become mid. It's not as good as it used to be. I think if you're a big Star Wars fan like this show but I can't force myself to like it.",6.0,5 June 2024
It's Over,"Star Wars is truly cooked. This franchise has been destroyed and it's kind of remarkable how everyone at Disney and Lucasfilms has refused to course correct. They can't even hire people that actually care about Star Wars, but to be fair who would want to work for Lucasfilms at this point? They hire Harvey Weinstein's former assistant to make a show that once again feels like a hollow vessel for a committee of talentless hacks to use a big platform for little payoff. These oh so virtuous creatives have done it again. How a person like Kathleen Kennedy still has a job is beyond me! The legacy of Star Wars has been so greatly tarnished that I genuinely don't think it can ever be mended. New generations of kids will just have a lukewarm reaction to their era of Star Wars and will gravitate to better properties. I would rather be chained up to Jabba Hutt in a metal bikini than watch anymore Star Wars stuff.",1.0,12 June 2024

Not worth your time,"Much better productions to watch. Just so bad now. The Acolyte storyline & characters unengaging or poorly developed. The plot lacks coherence, characters fall flat and underdeveloped, and the pacing is off, a uneventful overall viewing experience. Additionally, the technical aspects like poor special effects, uninspired cinematography, and weak dialogue also contributes to it being a poor series to spend time on. Disney has failed its fans with this latest release. Poor choices for actors and their characters. Its a shame that this has happened and what an insult to Mr. George Lucas who let this go years ago. He should acquire it back asap.",1.0,13 June 2024
This is not the Star Wars you are looking for,"I will not go in details on why this is terrible and waste your time after wasting mine watching this. But I had the same expression Krusty the clown had after watching Worker and Parasite. It feels like the people who signed off on the script were half awaken at 2h00 am just like I did with my parents when I had a bad report card. I can only imagine what could have been done with all those resources put in to this. There are some positives, the music and colors are ok. I don't want to bash this more than it deserve knowing full well that Star Wars has been a hit or miss on different occasions but one of my concerns is that this sets the bar so low that we might see anything else after this as a masterpiece.",1.0,13 June 2024
Jar Jar Binks was a museum masterpiece next to this,"Meesa no lika dis doodoo.

I mean seriously what were they thinking? Have they even watched what they produced?? The acting and writing are horrible they have completed destroyed this franchise! I mean come on it isnt hard to make entertaining star wars there are 1000's of stories surrounding this universe..

They could just copy the story of The Old Republic and have the most successful modern day star wars story with this production budget. But Nope. Seems they think they can do better with some teenage soap opera. Do they even have a passion for Star Wars? And even if its to recover the cost of purchasing the license, you can't even milk the franchise with such low quality efforts...

I made an account just to rate this junk,"That's right, I didn't have an account until this morning but had to create one so I could warn everyone to stay away from this junk. Banging your head on the wall would be a better use of your time than watching this. Episode 3 was awful. After watching I quickly got my VCR out and watched the Holiday Special from the late 70s so I could feel good about Star Wars again. Yes, it was that bad. I was longing for Bea Arthur and Harvey Korman to show up and save this show. Witches? Seriously? The Wicked Witch from the West was more enjoyable than these ""witches"". I don't get it, all the money they spend and they can't hire anyone with any talent to come up with something creative, or at least interesting. Boring, uncreative, lame storyline, nothing new or original, just the same old story lines. EXTREMELY disappointed, no reason to keep Disney+ any more. Can it get any worse?",1.0,12 June 2024
So far the most disappointing SW series ever,"After three episodes I really don't know where to start. Good things: it's in Star Wars Universe (at least it should be) Carrie-Anne Moss was also very classy in the beginning and I was glad to see her performing so well. But that's it then about the good things. It went so quickly for the 5 star dinner into the fast food department. The story is just childish and makes not much sense. Actors mediocre at their best. Nothing new nor interesting aspects in the show. I don't know what's the target audience, at least it's not made for the Star Wars fans at all. Light years behind Andor, Mandalorian and others.",,13 June 2024
I would not recommend this to my worst enemy,"From a creative standpoint and the way the lore is being disrespected, I cannot with good faith recommend this to my worst enemy. This cannot be canon to the Star Wars franchise. The writing is lackluster, the virtue signaling is unnecessary and the visuals are not even remotely pleasing. The only part I could kind of give props to is the action scenes but even then is only a small part of what is really just a giant dumpster fire.

I would rather watch the original trilogy and the animated series of stars wars. Even the video games are much better than this series. I really hope the producers and writers can do better and create something that values their core audience instead of sending a message.",1.0,13 June 2024
Agenda filled mess,"Bad, predictable Plot, poor Character writing and weird pacing.

""The Acolyte,"" the latest addition to the Star Wars universe by Leslie Headland, is a colossal disappointment. The plot is painfully predictable, following a tired and uninspired storyline that does little to engage viewers. It's clear that the show is more focused on ticking boxes for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion than on crafting a compelling narrative. This forced agenda overshadows any potential the show might have had, resulting in a contrived and unconvincing storyline.

The pacing in the first two episodes is dreadful, dragging along without any real momentum. The fight choreography is stiff and overly choreographed, making action scenes feel forced and unexciting. The characters are one-dimensional, with every male character portrayed as dumb and incompetent, a blatant attempt to undermine them rather than create strong, multifaceted female characters.

The show's attempt to be progressive comes off as pandering, and the lack of depth in its characters and story is glaringly obvious. ""The Acolyte"" feels more like a box-ticking exercise than a genuine addition to the Star Wars lore. If you're looking for a captivating and thrilling Star Wars experience, this isn't it. Save yourself the time and skip this poorly executed mess.",2.0,10 June 2024
What have they done to my favourite franchise?,"Star Wars is about leaving your own reality and entering a magical Star Wars universe that got me and many others so excited since the 80s (in my case). This is not Star Wars. I don't know what it is. It's an absolute disgrace that these creators are making a living from ruining something that used to be so perfect. I hope this is the breaking point for the current creators. That's the only positive I can derive from this absolute mess! It's one thing for Disney to ruin all of the best classic cartoon classics like the Little Mermaid etc, it's another to do it to something so precious as Star Wars.",1.0,13 June 2024
the downfall of starwars,"Probably the worst thing ive ever seen in my life (star wars related). Makes me want to cancel my disney + account.

Content and Structure The book is divided into two main sections. The first part is dedicated to the theory behind cooking, where Nosrat explains the roles of the four elements:

Salt: Enhances flavor.

Fat: Delivers flavor and creates texture.

Acid: Balances flavors.

Heat: Determines the texture of food.

Each section is rich with scientific explanations, personal anecdotes, and practical advice. Nosrat's approachable writing style makes complex concepts easy to understand and apply.",1.0,13 June 2024
Sad to see that it's HORRIBLE,"Starwars has continued to make new shows that are very entertaining. However the acolyte takes Ali's back 100 years before the fall of the republic which is quite neat. All this to say some how Disney scribed it up. The show has extremely poor writing and an uninteresting sorry. Not to mention the story has a contradiction ever 2 minutes. There is no build up and Disney some how expects us to become. Attached with the characters. Besides all of that the show just gives an unlikable vibe

This rating is made 3 episodes in so it may change.

The positives: I really like how starwars decided to go back in time rather than continuing to go foward

Solid start,"Production values closer to Andor than Obi-Wan this series works a good standalone project that doesn't require a load of fan service connections to enjoy. This is first live action attempt in the Disney era that is removed from the Skywalker Era and it's a refreshing to watch a Star Wars story that doesn't need a ""I remember him"" moment to cary the story.

The first two episodes are a slow burn, so I'll reserve final judgment when the entire series is over, but it's excellent start and something different from the normal Star Wars fair. I suspect Star Wars who aren't obsessed with politics will enjoy it.",8.0,5 June 2024
"Solid start, could go either way","Most of the negative reviews here were popping up well before the episodes even dropped, so that tells you what you should know about the objectivity of most of them.

It's a decent start to a show, nothing mind-blowingly amazing, but nothing bad either. Some promising performances and fight scenes that show the potential of where this show could go. It brings a lot of questions to the forefront that the show will seek to answer over this first season, and I'm intrigued by the possibilities. Ignore the reviews that speak of political ideology, because it objectively features no politics of any kind.

My guess would be that most of these negative reviews came from individuals whose minds were made up when the trailers first debuted. Ignore them, and frankly ignore mine, too. Go into this with an open and undecided mind. If you don't like it, fine. Not everything works for everyone and that's the way it goes. But don't let your enjoyment of something be determined by the opinions of a faceless and nameless crowd that have made it fairly clear they aren't concerned with engaging this show on any level other than a biased one.",7.0,5 June 2024
Watch through your fingers. The horror!,"The latest installment in the Star Wars saga, directed by an untalented amateur, has unfortunately inflicted unbearable activist messages throughout its runtime, marring the once-beloved franchise beyond recognition. Gone is the charm, excitement, and captivating storytelling that defined the original trilogy and its predecessors; instead, we are subjected to a disjointed and nonsensical plot that blatantly pushes a leftist agenda at every turn. The dialogue, written with the finesse of a child, grates on the ears, while the acting ranges from awkward to downright abysmal. Characters that were once iconic have been reduced to mere mouthpieces for the director's personal beliefs, delivering forced and preachy speeches that insult the intelligence of the audience. The film bears no resemblance to the Star Wars of the past, stripping it of its essence and transforming it into a hollow vessel for political indoctrination. It is a deeply disappointing and misguided effort that betrays the legacy of the beloved franchise and will undoubtedly leave fans feeling cheated and disillusioned.",1.0,12 June 2024
A Script Doctor and Ghostwriter's take on the Acoylte,"As a former working script doctor and ghostwriter, my advice to the writing team, read ""Save the Cat"" and their beat sheet on ""A New Hope."" The beat sheet highlights the hero's journey.

The Acolyte's inciting incident is not even in the series. The inciting incident is actually all the films and books that came before. The series is counting on us on being hooked to Star Wars. That is what propels us to watch. That is the inciting incident. In an attempt to be all inclusive it excludes the most important thing of all, the Star Wars lore, the history and continuity.

Stop forcing exposition, diversity, and show don't tell. It's okay to have a story that explores social themes if done right. Don't tell the audience what we need to feel. Show us and the emotion will come naturally.",1.0,12 June 2024
I Know Kung Fu,"Two episodes in and all I can think about is how much this series seems to have ripped off scenes from The Matrix. Having Carrie-Anne Moss effectively play Trinity again but dressed in a Jedi robe was bizarre and ridiculous.

The martial arts direction they appear to be trying to take for this series' action scenes makes for a strange and jarring choice. Even the non-Jedi characters seem to be experts in kung fu. It doesn't feel like Star Wars at all.

Much of the dialogue sounds flat, as if it were straight from a high school drama production.

I laughed hard at the scenes with Torbin, a levitating Jedi master, in the second episode. The makeup department takes a very young actor and gives him a terrible fake beard and receding hairline to make him look like an old man. It looks like something from an SNL sketch.

Overall, the show is generally uninteresting and at times laughable. This is the reason I will probably watch to the end, just to see how bad it gets.

So, it falls into the 'so bad it's good' category but I'm not sure that what the creators were going for.",3.0,6 June 2024
"Without Dave, Star Wars is nothing it seems.","I was so hopeful but after watching the first three episodes, it seems this show is just going to be another forgettable series that taints an otherwise well fleshed out and loved franchise. Yes there is other content which is less than perfect from Star Wars but this is by far the least interested I've been in almost 25 years. Unless by the end there is a definitive resolution to the series, I'm not sure I'll trust anything that's not written or co-written by Dave Filoni any more. The third episode especially was completely unnecessary as we had all of the information given to us already. It did not add anything besides a visual to go with the idea, especially since we now need to see none of the characters introduced in this episode again.

I don't write many reviews but I feel the need to contribute to the general feedback which I hope will give Disney a push back in the right direction.",1.0,13 June 2024
The end is near,"The Acolyte, the latest installment in the Star Wars franchise, is a devastating blow to the fandom. It completely misses the essence that made Star Wars a cultural phenomenon. The characters are shallow, the plot is incoherent, and the series seems to prioritize ticking boxes over crafting a compelling story. It's disheartening to see beloved lore mishandled so badly. The pacing is inconsistent, and the dialogue often feels forced and unnatural, lacking the wit and charm that once defined Star Wars. The decisions made in this show seem out of touch with what fans have cherished for decades. The Acolyte might be the final nail in the coffin for long-time fans, leaving us with a lingering sadness and a fear that Star Wars may never recover from this low point. Watching this show feels like witnessing the end of an era, one where the magic and excitement of Star Wars have been replaced by mediocrity and disillusionment. It's a harsh reminder that even the most beloved franchises can falter, and sadly, it seems Star Wars has reached an all-time low with The Acolyte.",1.0,13 June 2024
The final nail in the coffin.,Hope is not or else this is the final nail in the coffin for me regarding Star Wars future shows. Give up after watching the initial pilot episodes. How can someone even imagine coming out with such a lousy show. Total waste of time watching this ridiculously uninspired new series. Show start right off with scripts taken right off the typical Martial arts movie and then ended up with all kind of weird plots as if the producers were too lazy to think and just let AI to generate the script. By now I am truly convince that the top brass in Disney will not continue to stop destroying whatever is still left of our beloved Star Wars memories.,1.0,10 June 2024
The writing,"Is so beyond terrible and not only that it feels like the people that made this have never watched star wars. Disney taking ownership of star wars was the worst thing that ever happened to it. The only new one I kind of liked was the one with Adam Driver in it. Heck I wasn't even a huge fan of the original star wars, so It's not like I have a huge fan bias. I'm more into Star Trek.

My bar when it comes to sci fiction is extremely low. I don't need great CGI and the actors don't need to be perfect. I just want a well written and though out show. Did all the good writers for shows and movies die out not long ago?",,8 June 2024
Pretty into it!,"It's not perfect, but, y'know, not everything is. There's a lot of really cool work going on; love the characters (though Vernestra feels.. off). Gorgeous show, entertaining mystery, wonderful vibes. There's some editing weirdness. Some really cool EU pulls. Really great costuming and set work, and some real cool ships. Really interested in Sol, and I'm really interested to see where they go with the Sith in this stuff. There's a bit of stilted dialogue, but overall it comes together and works really well, at least for me.

I literally have no idea what some of these reviewers are talking about.",9.0,4 June 2024
Stop the unnecessary hate,I'm willing to bet the vast majority of reviewers on here haven't even watched the first five minutes of this series. If you actually paid any sort of attention to it you would find it is a decent show certainly not as good as andor but I mean what did you expect I doubt we'll ever get something on the same level as andor again. It was miles better than Ashoka and honestly I'm intrigued to find out more in the acolyte on Wednesday. To all those who are put off by the reviews please give this show a go it really isn't bad at all and if you made it through Ashoka you can easily make your way through the acolyte. Looking forward to Wednesday.,7.0,7 June 2024
Missed opportunity,"It disappoints with its slow pacing and underdeveloped characters. Despite its intriguing High Republic setting, the narrative is disjointed and fails to engage. Key characters lack depth and clear motivations, making it hard to connect with their journeys. Dialogue often feels forced and unnatural, detracting from the story's immersion. While some scenes are visually stunning, inconsistent special effects break the illusion of the Star Wars universe. Overall, it's a missed opportunity that doesn't meet the high expectations of the franchise, leaving both long-time fans and newcomers unsatisfied.",1.0,12 June 2024
"A pretty good start, better than I thought","First of all, the acting is pretty good, unfortunately Carrie-Anne Moss is not in it much but Lee Jung-jae and Dafne Keen are really damn good in the show, glad they got these roles.

Once the intrigue sets in the for the story it's intriguing enough to keep wanting to know more about what happened in the past, a good start to the story. Wanting to find out about the Sith shown in the trailer and what happened on a particular planet is a pretty good plot thread.

The set and costume design is also pretty good, love the costumes for the Jedi and the sets on planets are also quite good, makes you feel involved.

All in all, a pretty good start for the first 2 episodes, it feels a bit like a Young Adult novel but I mean in a good way; normally I'm not a big fan of those and I expected the show to be mid but it was a lot better than I thought.

Worth the watch.",9.0,5 June 2024
Not as good as I hoped but better than the reviews will make you believe,"The first glaring thing is that it must said is that this show will obviously be review bombed by conservatives and the Fandom Menace crowd because it features a cast of mostly minorities despite it being the type of show this crowd has asked for for almost a decade.

Besides this, to get to the substantive thoughts, for negative criticisms it has a lot of the standard Dissney Plus Star Wars problems where it looks a little off visually although it's definitely better looking than stuff like Mandalorian Season 3 and Ahsoka but not as good as Andor. It also falls into the standard Star Wars problem of some of the dialogue feeling kinda clunky which, some of it does.

For positives, the story is interesting so far and I am excited to see where it leads, there's not much to go through when it comes to characters, there's not too much depth to them yet but it's done enough where I'm interested to see where the show goes after this and it has earned me tuning in.",7.0,5 June 2024
"Goodbye Star Wars, goodbye Disney.","This is awful. There absolutely is no talent involved with Star Wars projects produced by Disney. The destruction of the Star Wars legacy continues with yet another sub standard written prequel. As a star wars fan I can't get behind this one. The writing is weak, the plot is predictable. Its like a poorly made fan film made by people with a surface level understanding of Star Wars. This show was given every opportunity to be good. Star Wars in an earlier era, 180 million dollars, and plenty of time to make it. It is really sad to see what Disney has done to Star Wars. Goodbye Star Wars, goodbye Disney.",1.0,10 June 2024
Major Letdown,"""The Acolyte,"" a recent addition to the Star Wars universe, falls disappointingly short on multiple fronts. Despite the high expectations that typically accompany any new Star Wars content, this show fails to deliver on almost every aspect.

The production value, usually a hallmark of the Star Wars franchise, is surprisingly subpar in ""The Acolyte."" The set designs and special effects often appear lackluster and unconvincing, undermining the immersive experience that fans have come to expect. The visual elements feel more like a forced attempt to capture the magic of the Star Wars universe rather than a genuine extension of it.

Casting is another area where ""The Acolyte"" stumbles. The actors seem miscast, and there is a noticeable lack of chemistry among the main characters. This disconnect makes it difficult to become invested in their journeys or care about their fates. Furthermore, the performances are generally uninspired, with many of the actors delivering their lines in a flat, disengaged manner that fails to bring any depth or nuance to their characters.

The script is perhaps the most significant letdown of all. The dialogue is often stilted and cliché, lacking the wit and charm that has characterized some of the best Star Wars entries. The plot feels disjointed and poorly paced, with numerous scenes that seem to drag on without adding meaningful development to the story or characters. Instead of a coherent and compelling narrative, ""The Acolyte"" offers a muddled series of events that struggle to hold the viewer's attention.

Overall, ""The Acolyte"" is a disappointing addition to the Star Wars saga. From its unimpressive production values to its lackluster casting and weak script, there is little to recommend. For fans looking for a new and exciting chapter in the Star Wars universe, this show is likely to be a letdown.",2.0,13 June 2024

pretty awful,"I am THREE of the letters in LGBTQIA and I am sick of this. Why was it necessary to say ""your mothers""? The usually word to use is 'parents'. That's what normal people say. It seems clear from the offset that once again, 'diversity' is being shoved in our faces rather than just try to tell a damn story. I am happy to have a diverse cast in media, I applaud it, but when it makes sense please, and don't draw attention to it like it's the only thing that matters, we are supposed to be normalising the existence of real people, not flashing them like some special badge. I mean if we'd seen her parents in the flashback, then it would have been much better, not shoved in our faces, just people there, normal like. But no, it has to be blatant.

To be honest I probably wouldn't complain so much if the writing was any good. Once again, a big budget show with absolute trash writing. Is the writers strike still going on? Is this being written by amateurs? I mean how is it that the jedi authorities do not know the capabilities of the species of one of their criminals? How can they not take precautions against a giant tentacle head?? And why are the Jedi not there on the ship they came on? Did they just stay behind for a coffee with the trade federation? Leaving the prisoners completely unsupervised, one of which is an ex jedi... and what the heck is with the 'acting' by the green Jedi woman? What the heck is that??? I have never seen something so wooden, even in low budget 90s tv shows.

Worse than garbage.,"I grew up with Star Wars, watching the movies and reading the books. Star Wars always had its own unique theme. Using it to push stupid ideas is a very dirty trick. For me, it's worthless; I don't even count it as Star Wars. The writing is terrible, the acting is bad, the actors are bad, and the director is awful. Even the interviews are empty and fake. It's not even about Star Wars; none of them know a basic thing about the universe. I feel so sad for people who pretend to care about it just for money. I am also sorry for people who are willing to do anything and pretend to be anything just because of money.

"Way to go, Leslye!","Leslye Headland is absolutely spot on. Our whole perception of Star Wars has been incredibly off-mark. To think we cherished it as a saga that masterfully wove together elements of myth, complex morality, and the timeless struggle of light against darkness, within an expansive, meticulously crafted universe. How utterly quaint of us! It seems we've been utterly blind to its true essence: an intergalactic teenage fanfiction, brimming with self-insert characters who gallivant across the stars, unburdened by depth or growth.

Why bother with the intricate dance of politics, the philosophical ponderings on the nature of power and responsibility, or the nuanced portrayal of humanity (and alien-ity) in all its complexity? Why invest in crafting a story that explores the delicate balances of the Force, when it's much simpler to pen down a universe that caters to the whims of adolescent fantasy? Forget the painstakingly constructed lore, the epic narratives that span generations, and the careful character development that has inspired millions across the globe. No, no, let's just reduce it all to a cosmic-scale teenage diary entry. After all, what value do themes of sacrifice, redemption, and the enduring hope in the face of overwhelming darkness have, when you can have your very own cosmic soap opera? Bravo, Leslye.

The first episodes of the show were good set up multiple characters early in the show. Disney explored a part of star wars that hasn't been televised yet and through the world building and plot they have me hooked. From someone who has read hundreds of books on the high republic, Disney has did it justice. Also if you watch that show and somehow you complain about it being too diverse you really need to look in the mirror because honestly you are the problem. Disney has laid the foundation for a great show and I'm excited to see where it goes.",8.0,5 June 2024
Strong start for a potentially great show,"The key word here is ""potentially""

The Acolyte's first episodes are a pretty strong start. The characterization of the Jedi is strong, very much in line with the order as Lucas described it, and as we saw in the PT.

The only downside is some clunky dialogue. Most pilot episodes have clunky dialogue, to introduce everything needed to the audience, and we usually forgive it because we get 19 more episodes. But with just 8 per season, every episode really counts, and I wish the character introduction to OSHA had better dialogue. Dialogue is better than the PT but that's a low bar to clear.

But really, everything else is strong by SW standards. Not as strong as Andor, but stronger than everything else since Mandalorian season 1. I am excited to see where this leads.",7.0,5 June 2024

STAR...T OVER,"This is officially the end of star wars for the old fans. I carry no hate for anybody but this is just not SW. I might not be the target audience anymore but these first two episodes have left me heartbroken as a huge fan of SW. Please try to avoid it if you are an 'Old' Star Wars fan. If you are a new SW fan watch it and enjoy it. Originality of plot, characters and settings is ABSENT. This show has not been thought through honestly and the reason we all know it: MONEY. They rush things up for making a profit, leaving the quality aspect vacant while fulfilling the quantity/income. There are even some editing mistakes in the scenes.",1.0,6 June 2024
Who is this for?,"I'm just baffled who this series is aimed at? I get that reinvention is a good thing, but the conflicting and contradictory nature of so much of this show seems almost designed to annoy people that like Star Wars. Is the play here that they are trying to alienate the current fan base and instead find a large new audience? I really don't think this can possibly work. It's really starting to feel like just making something people that like Star Wars would actually watch is something they are actively trying to avoid.

It's kind of depressing on so many levels. It's now starting to feel like the brand that Star Wars was is just not what they want Star Wars to be. When I think about the endless stories they could make instead, that would not exclude new audiences and still excite old audiences, it's just bizarre how we end up here. With such a middling show that seems to be made for an imaginary audience.

I guess the good thing about trying to alienate an audience is that eventually all of us feeling disappointment and then writing about, it will just stop caring anymore so there will be less people complaining. Maybe that's what Disney want?",4.0,13 June 2024
Very Strong Start,"I wouldn't normally choose to rate a television show, certainly not this early, but of course because this is a piece of Star Wars media choosing to have a diverse cast of characters it has been targeted with negative one star reviews. I thought I'd provide my opinion as someone who doesn't care about character casting, but rather the quality of the show itself. I firmly believe that practically no show honestly deserves a one star review, especially when the show hasn't even come out yet (we were seeing an overwhelming amount of one star reviews come in hours before the two episodes released!) Well, I have seen them now and I can honestly say this is a very intriguing, solid start that it is setting up. With the beginning of anything, ESPECIALLY mysteries, it is impossible to tell the direction and momentum it will keep; but these first two episodes were filled with exhilarating mysteries and intriguing twists that could potentially set up something remarkable. Let's hope that comment ages like wine rather than milk! If you are coming into it expecting something on the level of The Mandalorian you might be disappointed. While it is a strong start, at times it can feel cliché. If you are coming into this with a negative anchoring bias you will find plenty of things to dislike. But at the same time some of those clichés are what it excels at, using traditional plot devices to spawn intriguing mysteries. Something it also does is making a lot of bold decisions when it comes to revealing mysteries. The first two episodes, especially the first; revealed many things that in any other media you wouldn't expect to be revealed until the middle to late stages. This is what I mean by it may be setting up something remarkable; perhaps it is paving way for even larger mysteries and getting the minor stuff out of the way. It is also incredible to see the High Republic era adapted to live television, and I think it nails the setting well. This is not my expertise within the Star Wars universe, so I would trust fans of this era prior over this comment. Overall I think this is a lot better than a lot of the recent content we've been getting from Star Wars, and certainly it is worth your time. Would do 7.5/10 if I could. This review also only considers only the current content available to us, the first two episodes, so 7/10 doesn't say a lot. The hype in the reviews from other enthusiasts are very real!",7.0,5 June 2024
A Promising Star Wars Series Primarily for Young Adults,"The Acolyte offers solid visuals and strong performances, although the writing can be somewhat predictable. Overall, it's a promising series with several notable strengths.

Prós: The performances are a major highlight, with Lee Jung-jae standing out as Jedi Master Sol-he's definitely my favorite.

The visual effects and production values are impressive for a TV series.

The fight scenes are truly great, adding excitement and energy to the show.

The world-building is intriguing, setting the story in a different era without the familiar Skywalkers and others...

The pacing is well-executed, and the tone strikes a nice balance, avoiding excessive goofiness.

Plus, you don't need prior knowledge of the Star Wars universe to enjoy this series, making it accessible to newcomers.

There are some mixed aspects, though: The episodes are relatively short-just when you're getting into it, the credits roll.

The young cast is talented, but a bit more variety could add depth, although this is subjective.

Some elements are reminiscent of CW shows, which may or may not be your cup of tea.

The writing is competent but tends to play it safe, making it somewhat predictable.

Also, Dafne Keen is much cuter without the alien makeup, just my opinion...

Overall, if Andor is Star Wars for adults, The Acolyte is Star Wars for young adults.

It's a good show that expands the Star Wars universe in a fresh direction.

While it may not be compelling enough to justify a Disney+ subscription on its own, it's definitely worth checking out.

Just don't expect it to be your new obsession.",7.0,5 June 2024
Absolute JUNK!,"What a load of $#%#! This series is the worst on planet earth. What is Disney thinking??!! How about giving us a show that concentrates on pure entertainment. The script, acting and directing is the worst you'll ever see. 0 / 10. Scrap this junk immediately. A complete dumpster fire!!!

Star Wars under Disney and Kathleen Kennedy is dead. She's totally wrecked the whole universe, the characters and anything that makes sense. The Acolyte really shows how far they have plummeted and just produce junk without any care. I'm a Star Wars fan and I'm open to all shows... but f@$& me! How can something cost so much and be a sack of smokin' crud!

Star Wars is worse than Dr. Who,This show is awful. This show is what happens when stupid people are given free rein to make whatever garbage they can dream of. This is the sound and fury of people that only care about the message and hate the art they are suppose to create. Whoever made this garbage hates Star Wars. Whoever approved this garbage hates Star Wars. These people are trash humans and I hope nothing but the worst for them. They have taken a great franchise and burned it to the ground just to rule over the ashes. Everyone involved with this garbage should be arrested for crimes against humanity. Shame on them and anyone that tells you this is good.,1.0,13 June 2024
Star Wars: A New Low,"I'll set the tone for this review: in the first ten minutes of episode 1, the lead character used an extinguisher to put out a fire... in the vacuum of space.

Yes, the writing is that imbecilic, and there's no signs of it improving by the end of episode 2. The problem with dumb writers is that you get dumb characters. That's how the story progresses, characters making inexplicable assumptions and illogical judgments as blatant devices to drive a bewildering plot forwards.

The series really doesn't feel as though it is part of the Star Wars franchise. The producers seem to be smitten with the Matrix, not George Lucas' legacy.

If you have expectations of a low budget sci-fi kung fu show that feels like fan fiction created by 13 year olds, you won't be disappointed.

The other notable observation I had was that all the characters feel so revoltingly weak. They exhude incompetence. They are soft, squishy, useless people with zero gravitas, authority or nobility. If it were a series about hairdressers, fine. But as Jedi knights and force wielding assassins, a hard ""no"".

The sole purpose of this series seems to be one giant DEI reach-around for the identity politics minority. Yeah, I'm sure that anyone who objects to extreme politicization in what should be fan entertainment will be prejudiced as a '..phobe' or an '..ist'. Narcissism does not permit people to acknowledge their failings.

I've been a Star Wars fan since watching episode 4 in the cinema as a kid. I even thought Ashoka was okay. This is the end of the line for me.",1.0,5 June 2024
Star Wars writers should know...Star Wars?,"Episode 1 was hard to watch. Writing on this series so far is at the CW level, and toward the low end of that. The casting, or miscasting perhaps, is baffling. The lead looks too young for the character she portrays, and lacks seriously in presence. The character isn't interesting to boot. What was the thinking behind assigning her this acting task? Other characters suffer from the same mismatch problems. It's as if the characters and their actors were drawn out of a hat.

Onto other issues. Dialog is clunky. As an example during a fight, one character asks another why they are there. Answer: to kill you. If killing with excess cringe were STAR WARS canon, this would be a dangerous weapon for THE ACOLYTE.

Kung-fu action is another main theme for this series. Why? It doesn't look like STAR WARS. Could we get some explanation why the fighting style is suddenly front and center?

In sum, THE ACOLYTE is a poorly written mess out the gate, and it suffers from an apparent general lack of understanding in regard to the STAR WARS universe. Overall showrunning on this one is poor.",3.0,6 June 2024
It's good! Ignore the fake Star Wars fans,"It's really good. I had low expectations, but it surprised me and feels like Star Wars again. Good balance of visual effects and real sets. Sure, there is some clunky writing but overall it's really good. I like the fact that they show younger Jedi with different maturity levels. The point of many Star Wars stories is that the Jedi are not perfect. Many of the negative reviews just reflect a general hatred of Disney and are not objective. Overall, hope people can just enjoy this show, it's just a show! It maintains the star wars feel and explores a different timeframe that we haven't seen before which make it interesting.",9.0,7 June 2024
Updated review after episode 3,,7.0,6 June 2024
I've got a bad feeling about this...,"Bad script, bad casting, bad acting, and bad directing. Bad Disney.

My caveat: I could only make it through the first episode and a few minutes of the second one before I threw in the towel. So, it is possible - albeit extraordinarily unlikely - that it gets better. That said, I won't watch any more of it.

I can't help thinking that someone pitched the show as a project unrelated to Star Wars and it was rejected by every studio. Disney then said to the writer, ""What if you change the king fu master to a Jedi and we say it's part of the Star Wars universe?"" The writer replied, ""What's Star Wars?"" and Disney said, ""Sold!""

If Disney is wise, they will yank it down and pretend it never happened, like the Star Wars Christmas special.

P. S. Despite this, I have not given up on Disney's Star Wars yet, and will hope the next series will be more Andor and less Acolyte.",2.0,10 June 2024
"Seriously, Disney!??","This is really too much! You have destroyed this IP. The once-beloved Star Wars franchise is now a shadow of its former self, and it's incredibly disappointing to see such a decline in quality. At least the Star Wars games are still good, for now.

It's really nuts, is what it is. Apart from the insipid narrative that they are shoving down our throats, the story itself is just bad. The plot feels disjointed and lacks the magic that once made Star Wars so special. The acting is horrendous, with performances that feel wooden and uninspired. It's almost as if the actors themselves don't believe in the material they are working with.

The dialogues are stilted and awkward, making it hard to engage with the characters. The scriptwriters seem to have forgotten how to write natural, compelling conversations. On top of that, the actions taken by the characters are often illogical, leaving viewers scratching their heads and questioning their motivations.

So there you go. You've destroyed it. The only positive aspect I can point out is that it looks good. The visual effects are impressive, and the production design is top-notch. However, good looks alone can't save a show from poor storytelling and weak performances.

In the end, it is unwatchable. It's a sad day for Star Wars fans who have been eagerly awaiting new content, only to be let down by such a disappointing series. Let's hope future projects can redeem this once-great franchise.",1.0,13 June 2024

The worst Star Wars project since the Holiday Special.,"Quite literally the worst Star Wars project since the Holiday Special. It actively changes the Star Wars universe, the nature of the Force, and all of the canon that has come before. It's straight garbage, written by people with no respect for the franchise, and directed by people with no capability of creating a TV show. It's profoundly senseless.

Poorly written, poorly acted, poorly edited, and poorly paced. The entire show appears to be little more than a vanity project full of self-inserts rather than real characters. The decisions made by the characters don't make sense and break immersion constantly. The concepts introduced seem to be little more than whims, with no reasoning behind them and no explanation as to why they don't line up with franchise canon.

The idea behind the story may be decent, but the writer/showrunner is far too vain and inept to give it a proper attempt.",2.0,7 June 2024
Critical Review of 'The Acolyte': A Star Wars Fan's Perspective,"As a lifelong Star Wars enthusiast, it deeply pains me to declare that 'The Acolyte' is one of the most lifeless and extremely boring shows I have ever encountered. To say it was disappointing would be an understatement. It has reached a point where I am seriously contemplating cancelling my Disney+ subscription.

The script is abysmal, riddled with clichés and lacking any semblance of the magic that once defined the Star Wars universe. The dialogue is painfully dull, and the plot progression is excruciatingly slow. Episode 3, in particular, stands out as a nadir of the series, with its ridiculous storyline and poorly defined characters. The introduction of the witches of Dathomir is poorly executed and seemingly derivative, with clear elements stolen from the myth of The Norns spinning the threads of fate at the foot of Yggdrasil. Additionally, the concept of asexual reproduction for the twins is laughably absurd.

The acting, too, leaves much to be desired. The performances are wooden and unconvincing, failing to evoke any emotional response. It is difficult to care about the characters or their fates when they are portrayed so dispassionately. I genuinely believe a two-year-old could deliver more compelling performances than what we are subjected to in 'The Acolyte'.

Leslye Headland, the showrunner, has demonstrated an alarming lack of talent both as a director and a screenwriter. Her approach to this beloved franchise is nothing short of disastrous. It is clear that she lacks the creative vision and storytelling prowess needed to bring the Star Wars universe to life. The decision to entrust her with this project is baffling and has proven to be a monumental mistake.

Reflecting on the bigger picture, two colossal errors have led us to this travesty: George Lucas selling his brand and leaving it in the hands of Kathleen Kennedy. Under their stewardship, the franchise has lost its way, with 'The Acolyte' being the most egregious example of this decline. The essence of Star Wars has been diluted, replaced by a soulless, uninspired cash grab.

As a lifelong fan, it is disheartening to admit that I would rather watch 'Bridgerton'-a show that would never typically make it onto my watch list-than endure another episode of 'The Acolyte'. This sentiment speaks volumes about the show's profound failings.

In conclusion, Leslye Headland, you suck. Your involvement in this project seems to be a testament to the power of connections over actual talent. Episode 3 is so badly written and ridiculous that it begs the question: is Disney intent on destroying itself, let alone allowing Kathleen Kennedy to dismantle a once-great brand? Just one word: Why? The Star Wars universe deserves better, and so do its fans. It is my fervent hope that future projects will restore the magic and wonder that once defined this beloved franchise.",,12 June 2024
A dark side of Star Wars,"Darker, martial arts-oriented, and set in a relatively unknown era of the Star Wars cosmos. ""The Acolyte"" presents a side of Star Wars that I have missed for years. However, I understand that this can be a very subjective matter. The Acolyte is not Andor, which, at least for me, sets the standard by which I like to measure Star Wars series.

Nevertheless, ""The Acolyte"" falls short of my expectations with its irregular pace and superficial character development. Despite the attempt to blend a crime story with classic Star Wars elements, the execution feels disjointed and lacks the necessary dark tone.

What the series does achieve: It piques curiosity from episode to episode. As a true Star Wars fan, I can overlook the occasionally mediocre soundtrack that merely tries to imitate its predecessors. This is an indication of what can be summarized as follows: An absolutely worth-watching series for fans, but it is indeed a ""new"" Star Wars.",7.0,5 June 2024
Hoping This One Doesn't Fall Apart,"I've have had mixed feelings on the Disney Star Wars shows that have been coming out have averaged from fair to downright awful.

All I have to say is that this series has had a decent start to its first two episodes.

I'm enjoying the murder mystery aspect of the show so far and I am hoping the writers keep up the tension of the plot.

As for the action it is quite good with an emphasis on martial arts than the usual lightsaber fare.

And let us not forget the time period of the show that takes place a century before the Empire. I'm relieved they are going this route. The last thing I want to see is another Darth Vader or Bobblehead Luke Skywalker cameo.

Let's just say I am optimistic for this one.

Dumpster Fire,"I wish I could give this show 0 stars. I do not understand how you take such an amazing franchise and turn it into a political nightmare. The vast majority of Star Wars fans just want a good story and accurate lore. Not this bull they are shoving down our throats.

I went into this show open minded and after the first two episodes I was not impressed. However, after the third I am just completely done and heart broken what has become of Star Wars after being a lifetime fan.

Disney needs to either give up the rights to the franchise to people that actually know the lore and care about what they are putting out or do a full clean house and hire the individuals that have been making these amazing fan films that are better than 90% of what Disney has released.

"high production value, but cringe and horrible dialogue","There are a two positive traits here. The production value is (mostly) high, and as always with star wars the sound design and music score is great.

Sadly the money spent on making this (mostly) look and sound good is also the only positives.

From the very start the dialogue is so cringe inducing I was almost throwing up. This feels like it has been written by a 9yo fangirl of Darth Kennedy. Some tiny little girl, filled with hatred of star wars and loathing of Star Wars fans, became the acolyte of Kathleen Kennedy and was then given hundreds of millions to put her incoherent thoughts down as a TV show. That is what this feels like.

The story, as far is there is one, is likewise confusing and make little to no sense. The acting is so poor I can only deduce they found these ""actors"" (I use the term very loosely) in a parking lot at KFC.

And on this show we get a fire in space. Yes, so that happened... And then we got a fire that burns from stone, burning down a mountain... what the.... I don't think the showrunners know how even fire works.

This is so bad, so badly done, so badly acted, so cringe, that when you see this surrounded by high production value your brain goes tilt. There is a disconnect and weird feeling coming over you. How did this become made? And who green-lit throwing this much money at someones hateful school play?

I give an extra point for the production value and sound design, plus I could not help myself laughing at the bad acting and cringe dialogue. Laughter is always nice. But 2/10 do feel like a too high score.

This is really bad TV, with the worst acting ever seen on this level. If you like star wars, stay away from this disaster. And if you do watch leave your cringe-o-meter at home because it will explode because this is super cringe. Your spine will crackle and your eyes will explode cringe.",2.0,5 June 2024

The acting and story is terrible and you can tell whoever created this show does not even care about the Star Wars source material. The thing that make Star Wars so brilliant and enjoyable are the characters you come to love and for this show there has been no character development what so ever. For how much money they spent on marketing and the production, the costumes and makeup are shotty at best. I really hope a lesson is learned from this show going forward that if you have someone who hates the IP produce a show in that IP it will never be successful.",1.0,11 June 2024
"It's good, watch it and form your own opinion.","I just finished watching the two episodes and so far it's good. I really don't understand the hate. It's like people can't form their own opinion and will just follow some reviewers bleak view of every movie/tv show. Those people have to critic everything so they can put out content. Negative reviews get more views than positives ones. It's not actually an honest review. They're all just trying to get more views and they'll say anything bad to get it.

I saw a bunch of bad reviews on youtube and after watching the show it's about two sisters. Yin and yang, good vs evil. Standard star wars stuff. Family and siblings fighting on opposite sides. The fighting was cool and the story is just starting to develop. I don't see how you can just write this off as a disaster from two episodes.

They didn't make any star wars content for over a decade and If these people keep blindly review bombing every new film or show. They'll stop making them and then we won't get anymore. I don't know about you but i enjoy them all. They're all good in their own way.

I gave it a ten to make up for the ridiculous one's. The show is a solid 7/10 so far and will only get better as the story develops. If you're rating the show a one. You're clearly biased against Disney/Star Wars.",,6 June 2024

I would say its in the middle of the star wars series in ranking for me and potentially better than Obi One Kenobi, The Book of Boba Fett and Aksoka but I would need to see more to be set this in stone above them.

most juvenile Star Wars ever,This is by far the most juvenile and boring Star Wars show ever. The story felt like it was written by a teenager for kids. Disney really should have stopped at Obi Wan and quit. The acting and casting are just obviously amateurish. And the showed started with Kung fu fighting like in the matrix and that is just a new low for Star Wars stories. The casting of the lead actress felt really forced.

The directing wasn't perfect, but it's still far from an issue. Overall, these episodes were a great way to start the series.

I can no longer expect to rely on Disney's identity. Even as time passes, one can only admire the focus on movies that are easy to watch before going to bed, rather than Disney's consistent family, teenage, and fairytale-like storytelling.

It is time to decide whether we need to wait and watch Disney movies in the future. It will be sufficient to focus solely on distribution for a while without getting involved in movie production. This is because there seems to be some money left. I see not getting involved in incision making as Disney's final good deed to avoid damaging the movie entertainment business.

Feels like something a teen would come up with,"To keep the review simple, the characters' behavior and the story they try to tell in these first two episodes feel bland. It feels as if it would be a sketch done by a pre-teen redrawn together by great visual artists.

The show does look and feel great. The environment is well put together as is the CGI.

Events seem to happen somewhat randomly only to forcefully push the story forward or to trigger some sort of emotion without any particular setup or explanation.

The characters feel like they would be part of the Jedi world, but they behave so poorly as trained Jedi masters.

On the other hand, it could be a story about how the Jedi order has been slacking and degrading due to them having taken over the galaxy and being in control for so long at the point in time where the show takes place.

Disney Failed again,"Disney's latest foray into the Star Wars saga, ""The Acolyte,"" is a disappointing addition that fails to live up to its potential. Despite its ambitious premise, the series stumbles in almost every aspect, making it a frustrating watch as a Star wars fan.

First and foremost, the storytelling in ""The Acolyte"" is a mess. The plot feels disjointed and poorly paced, with episodes dragging on without meaningful progression. Instead of building a cohesive narrative, the series opts for a convoluted storyline that leaves you more confused than intrigued. The characters, who should be the heart of any Star Wars story, are underdeveloped and lack depth. Their motivations while clear, however their actions often seem inexplicable, making it hard to care about their fates. Just aweful.

The dialogue is another major issue. It's riddled with clichés and uninspired lines that fail to capture the epic feel of the Star Wars universe. Moments that should be filled with tension and drama instead come across as flat and lifeless. The series also tries to inject humor inappropriately, breaking any semblance of immersion.

Visually, ""The Acolyte"" is a mixed bag. While some of the special effects are impressive, they can't compensate for the lackluster set designs and uninspired cinematography. The series does little to explore new and exciting worlds, instead rehashing familiar settings without adding anything fresh or innovative. Worse still, the entire production feels like a low-budget endeavor. The costumes look cheap, the practical effects are lackluster, and many scenes lack the polish one would expect from a major franchise like Star Wars.

The cast, despite their best efforts, struggle with the material they are given. Talented actors are wasted on poorly written characters and uninspired dialogue, resulting in performances that feel wooden and unengaging. The chemistry between the leads is virtually nonexistent, further diminishing the series' emotional impact.

In conclusion, ""The Acolyte"" is a missed opportunity for Disney and the Star Wars franchise. It lacks the compelling narrative, strong characters, and captivating visuals that fans have come to expect. Instead of expanding the Star Wars universe in meaningful ways, it feels like a hollow, forgettable addition.

Another Disney Ruined Franchise,,2.0,5 June 2024
I can't believe this made it through review,"What a laughably bad show. Horrible writing, wooden characters, plots filled with holes big enough to drive a truck through. The characters are not even remotely likeable. I typically like to finish what I start and I found myself wishing the show was over or letting my mind wander rather than paying attention to the train wreck playing out on screen.

It is sad what Disney has done to the Star wars universe. While there have been a couple of surprises, such as Rogue One, overall it's utter nonsense coming out. I really hope they pull it together somehow and stop putting out drivel like this. We can only hope.",1.0,10 June 2024
It's so sad...,"I'm starting to wonder what this is all about... I mean, there are logic ans plot holes in the script that you have to catch, even if you're scrolling on your smartphone at the same time. I've rarely experienced that to this extent. Just one example: How can you say that no one survived the crash of the ship? As Jedi, you hopefully came up with the idea of checking the empty(!) prison cell first, right? RIGHT? Either all these actions will lead to a huge plot twist at some point in the series or....'ll spare me the rest. I can't list it here without spoiling it, but honestly, who wants to watch this piece of work? Then to claim that the people who criticize it aren't real fans, that really takes the cake. Sorry but this was it for me... As long as nothing changes regarding the quality of the series, I won't be watching anything else from Disney.",1.0,11 June 2024
This is unwatchable,"I went into ""Acolytes"" with cautious optimism, hoping for a fresh and respectful addition to the Star Wars saga. Instead, what I witnessed was an utter travesty. Episode 3 of this new series has single-handedly demolished everything that makes Star Wars beloved by millions.

Firstly, the plot is an incoherent mess that shows a blatant disregard for established lore. They've thrown all the iconic elements of Star Wars into the garbage, leaving behind a hollow shell. The storyline doesn't just fail to make sense-it actively undermines the entire saga.

One of the most egregious offenses is the destruction of Anakin Skywalker's redemption arc. Anakin's journey from a Jedi to Darth Vader and back to the light was a central pillar of the original and prequel trilogies. ""Acolytes"" not only undermines this arc but obliterates it beyond recognition. The notion that Anakin's birth, once a unique and mysterious event conceived through the Force, is now rendered meaningless is a slap in the face to fans. By introducing other characters conceived in the same manner, the film diminishes Anakin's significance and cheapens his story.",1.0,12 June 2024
The worst Star Wars series yet,"The Acolyte is truly horrible. Badly written two part opening episodes and terrible acting. It is just a joke what they have done to this franchise. The Mandalorian was superior to this in every way, and it isn't even close. There are no characters that provoke the viewer to care about them aside from Sol. Mae is especially wooden and unlike-able. Would give this a zero if possible. This takes place before Skywalker saga, and the high republic setting could have been interesting but the writers did nothing original at all. Investigating crimes with your Padawan. Wow. Where have we seen that before.",1.0,8 June 2024
so bad it should be illegal,"Since 20 years disney think its enough to add ""force"" and ""jedi"" to make a star wars movies. Sorry they are wrong. This is probably the worst star wars thing ever created. Lame dialogs, lack of action or intrigue, its just boring.you dont even feel that you are in the star wars universe. Sound more like a b-serie sci-fi movie, completely disconnect from the universe it should represent. Like other were stating, it sadly looks like SW have been fried forever by disney. What a shame.

So many cringey moments and unwatchable periods. With a $180 million budget you would hope for a bit more creative end product. Rouge one showed us it can be done. Just hire back that entire team including Gareth Edwards. Kathleen Kennedy HAS to go! She is literally destroying a legacy of a beautiful franchise that once was. I don't even know where they go from here if they ignore the onslaught of negative reviews regarding this project. George Lucas please help us, you're our only hope.",1.0,12 June 2024
A mess,"As a long-time Star Wars fan, it pains me to say that the franchise seems to have lost its way. The latest spin-off, while boasting a cool concept, failed to capture the magic and excitement that once defined Star Wars. It's reminiscent of the disappointment I felt with the third season of The Mandalorian - promising at first glance, but ultimately underwhelming.

The franchise, once a beacon of innovative storytelling and unforgettable characters, now feels mediocre. It's disheartening to see such a beloved series lose its luster. Perhaps it's time for me to explore new galaxies, far away from Star Wars.

I found it hard to force myself to like it. The legacy of Star Wars deserves better than this. It's time for Disney to course correct and breathe new life into this once-thriving universe. .",1.0,12 June 2024
This is not Star Wars,"Jedis in uniforms? Poor CGI.

Amanda Stenberg as Mae/Osha is wooden and uninspiring as a character. The only good thing about her OSHA character is Pip, he's a pretty cool droid. I felt like I was watching a bad Star Wars version of Crouching Tiger Sleeping Dragon. This is so poorly written that it's obvious that the only intention of the writer/director was to let us know their social beliefs. There is absolutely zero respect for Star Wars lore in this series.

Why Disney...,"1-2 episodes are absolutely boring and not fun to watch.

And this is supposed to be one of the most expensive Star Wars series? I just don't know why Disney has to destroy everything. I don't know what else is supposed to happen that the series will pick me up, it's just not fun. I just hope it gets better, otherwise it will be the worst Star Wars series of all time... unfortunately. The only good character was Master Sol, the others are incredibly uninteresting.

Good. Not Great. Which is Improvement.,"The main character, Amandla Stenberg, comes out firing on all cylinders and along with Lee Jung-jae, Sol, highlight some of the excellent acting and fight choreography that headline the show. It's clear the emphasis of this series is to immerse the audience into an unshown time of the Star Wars universe, and they spend the money to make it feel fleshed out and beautiful. More of an action drama than political drama like Andor, but it carries enough mystery and intrigue to keep you wanting more.

Some of the writing is a little clunky, but isn't so bad as to detract from the adventure. (Although fire in space?? Come on.) This is a what I originally expected from Disney+ streaming, less than gold standard, but engaging, new, content.

Certainly worth a watch if you're a Star Wars fan or even enjoy great fight choreography.

To those curious if there's a political agenda of note... man, I didn't even notice what some of these reviewers were talking about until I read their comments. Nothing heavy handed or preachy. No super teams or crazy monologs. Chill, broskies.",7.0,5 June 2024
WARNING!!,"I started watching this with the hope to be entertained. I was disappointed. When the Jedi said to a complete stranger ""yes my child?"" I knew the writing was going to be bad. The characters are forgettable and unlikable which causes me to have no interest in any of the actions of plots of the show. Only two episodes in and I decided to look at the reviews and saw 10s...these are obviously fake and it's just pathetic to see people doing this. This is horrible entertainment. The effects should definitely be better since it's easy to tell they put a lot of money into it.

VFX wasn't that great yk it's fine but the writing was an abomination why would u start kung fu fighting in front of Jedi who can block u with just force. The Acolyte mae was supposed to be fearful I legit can't stop laughing at her character. The logical fallacies and cringe dialogues I mean diversity was one thing but sacrificing the core to a good series isn't remotely a good decision. How could a director mess up that bad idk although there was hate from the start even the trailer had 75 percent dislikes I was still hopeful. Overall, I'll pass on this one.",2.0,5 June 2024
A fire in space...,"So I sat down to watch this, but just a few minutes in with the scene where the main character is fighting a fire outside a spaceship (in space with no oxygen), which looked more like she was trying to BBQ her dinner, made me cringe.

Whilst it is sci-fi, and it is meant to be imaginative, there still needs to be some reality to it - fire just can not exist without oxygen...

The rest of the episode just went downhill from that point, like an out of control freight train which is on fire (with oxygen).

I am not sure what they were hoping to achieve with this series, but it truly is the worst of all the spin offs - and I didn't mind the rest.",1.0,10 June 2024
Great CGI and sets RUINED by childlike writing,"As per the title, it feels like Star Wars, it looks like Star Wars, it sounds like rehearsals for a school play. The dialogue is linear and cheesy. You can almost anticipate what is going to be said next it's that laden with cliché, and the action is also predictable. And can we please dispense with the cutesy droids every lead seems to have? They've played it safe by ticking every diversity box , I wonder why thats why she's called OSHA?

If you don't want to watch the acolyte but want a reference to help you understand how bad most of the acting is, cast your mind to the youngling in ROTS. ""Master skywalker there are too many of them...."" Now apply that childlike wooden delivery to almost every line.",1.0,8 June 2024
Not so Super Space Detectives,"Ties with Obi Wanky Nobby in having an intriguing first few minutes that rapidly degenerates into a plodding, rambling, disjointed, nonsensical, snooze-inducing mess punctuated with an occasional laser-sword being swung around incompetently.

But at least Wanky Nobby had a lead that could act. Stenberg, and the entire cast bar Squid Game (and Trinity, very briefly), are so bland as to be instantly forgettable.

This isn't Star Wars, it's content-sludge Super Space Detectives with a few memberberry lines that call back (or forward) to the things that you used to like.

The million-dollars-a-minute budget (yes, literally) produces some reasonable sets and cinematography, but plot, pacing, dialog and editing that are straight out of the CW, with all the walking-down-corridors, weaponised dumbing, and purely expositional speeches that we've come to expect.

The writing is simply appalling, below fanfic levels. Characters (for want of a better word) deliver lines that directly contradict actions that we've already seen, or even their own previous line. That really happens, several times. ""This, but also that."" Is this an exercise in doublethink?

What is wrong with these 2 episodes?????

Star Wars fans are the worst and I am ashamed to consider myself one I get it the original movies are the best I get it but there's so much more lore to explore in star wars if people world just give it a chance at this rate all we're going to have is the old movies cuz short sighted Star Wars fans are going to ruin anything new with there negativity.

"Wow, Trolls will be trolls. Worth the watch if you're a true Star Wars fan.","Watched the first two episodes and am enjoying. It's not great, but it is far from terrible. It's more of a ""Book of Boba Fett"" level entry into the Disney archive of Star Wars shows than Andor or Mando but it really doesn't warrant the hate it's getting. As far as story and acting it's a similar level to Obi-wan and BoBF for me, shows which I similarly found good not great but equally enjoyed the ride.

The message... again,"In the first two episodes of this unbelievable catastrophe there is nothing worth watching or listening. Sure, they put some effort in the choreography, but that's so empty if you have no back story, no connection to attach to the characters... The acting is bad (especially the green Jedi master!), the lights are in all the wrong places, the story has no coherence, and it's like it's filmed backwards but only half way... Not to mention that one of the characters puts out a fire in the vacuum of space. I get it, it's Hollywood, but this audience will NEVER stand for this kind of stuff!

But... c'mon guys! We're watching live action Star Wars and for all its flaws, the show is actually pretty good. The new flighting styles (not sure how it fits with my idea of Star Wars) are entertaining. The mysterious dark mentor, etc.

Abysmal,"After observing the initial episodes of the series, I have formed an unfavorable opinion regarding its overall quality. The acting performances are subpar, and the storyline lacks compelling elements. Furthermore, the voice of Mays' master bears a striking resemblance to Kylo Ren, which adds an unintentionally humorous aspect to the series. Given these observations, I do not anticipate that the remaining episodes will offer any significant improvement. Consequently, I have decided to discontinue watching the series.

I would rather Disney just stopped flogging a dead horse if this is what they are going to come up with. This is by far and away the worst Star Wars show ever made. I cannot state this strongly enough, avoid at all costs. This makes the prequels look like works of genius by comparison. George Lucas will be distraught seeing what Disney are doing.",1.0,12 June 2024
Brilliant. Stunning. Breathtaking.,"It is indeed breathtaking, like in the end-of-life sequence. Like a soul escaping in the last breath.

It is also stunning. It's stunning that something could be so talentless and devoid of any artistic impulse or verve. Small children can create far more meaningful and interesting stories with crayons and printer paper stapled together.

Maybe it is the fact that they have a beautiful experience inside them, and that beauty is foundational of all art, whether a cave painting or beautiful handwriting. Could it be that Disney is left with only bad people who can do nothing more than make ugly and meaningless works?

It's Brilliant in the British sense of the word. Like when the neighbor's toilet upstairs is overflowing through the vents. What a predictable mess this movie. Hopefully, this will be the ignoble but merciful death of Star Wars after the abuses of Disney directors, of whom were former director's of Weinstein abuses, and abuses at fantasy island.

They are both the evil twin.,"Not connected to the Skywalker saga...Matrix memberberries ...Need to counteract the negative reviews...It wasn't that difficult to watch...At least we got some more Star Wars just be grateful...Things are different now it's 2024.

These are some of the things people that cry ""review bombing"" will say to justify this show. Star Wars doesn't need to change the galaxy is already interesting enough. Disney has proven they can make good Star Wars with Andor and The Mandolorian season 1 and 2 so you can't say I am hating on everything Disney makes. It makes me feel like they just choose not to which makes it even more infuriating.

The Acolyte is what you get when you put an incompetent show runner in charge and make diversity, equity, and inclusion a main priority. You can work in DEI, but you need talented writing to distract you from it or it takes you out of the story. It felt like a CW sci-fi show from the very beginning so it never gives you a chance to get interested.

I guess one star for a few decent visuals but that is all and I mean all this show has so far. It doesn't feel like Star Wars it feels like a random sci-fi show for preteens which would be ok if it wasn't destroying and affecting a beloved IP.",1.0,10 June 2024
Decent show with potential,"As someone who is frustrated with Disney Star Wars and their recently creatively bankrupt ideas, I must say this is surprisingly alright. The fact it takes place outside the Skywalker Saga makes it better for me as we are seeing mostly original characters and no rehashing(hopefully) for the sake of fan service. 2 episodes are too soon to judge it fully but I feel like if the remaining 6 episodes are good, this show can be considered great or if they are mediocre or bad instead then this becomes just like Book of Boba Fett and the sequels. But all the 1's and 10's are straight up just two sides review bombing it positively and negatively. This show is nowhere near a 1/10 and also nowhere near 10/10. The fact is I like what I have seen so far.

Another thing this show does do really well is the CGI and the species which are surprisingly good as well. I was shocked at how diverse and well made the species were considering the fact that the Grand Inquisitor was butchered in Obi Wan. I thought Disney were never gonna get past making ever creature look like a reskinned human. Overall, a decent but flawed start to a series that has potential.",7.0,5 June 2024
It could have been good,"I thought at first the reviews were being a little harsh and that maybe they were just hating on the writer. So I decided to make up my own mind and sat down with popcorn in hand, the lights down low and the stereo up high.

Fast forward 30 minutes and it was painfully evident that the terrible reviews were justified.

Its amazing that someone can take a franchise as big as Star Wars which guarantees viewers, and then decides its a platform to express their political and social views. People don't watch Star Wars to be reminded of what is happening in the world....they watch it to escape to another world and leave behind all their worries.

Thank fully bad reviews like this will finally catch up to the individuals who make rubbish like this, and they will eventually become outdated and forgotten when studio bosses finally understand that allowing people to express their one sided agenda through movies and TV will result in monetary losses to the studio.",2.0,10 June 2024

I am so sick and tired of this... when will they learn? I honestly think this is embezzlement for larger corporate entities that need a net loss on media subsidiaries.

Everybody talk slow the way kids talk when they're imitating a movie. And that's what this is, an imitation of a movie. I'd call it a fan film, but it wasn't even made by fans.

"Disney's 'The Acolyte': A Disjointed, Underwhelming Addition to the Star Wars Saga","Disney's latest addition to the Star Wars saga, ""The Acolyte,"" is a disappointing effort that fails to deliver on its potential, leaving fans frustrated. Despite its ambitious premise, the series falters in almost every aspect, making it a difficult watch for dedicated Star Wars enthusiasts.

The storytelling in ""The Acolyte"" is a mess, with a disjointed and poorly paced plot that drags on without meaningful progression. The narrative feels convoluted and confusing, leaving viewers more puzzled than intrigued. Characters, the heart of any Star Wars story, are severely underdeveloped and lack depth, with their actions often seeming inexplicable. This makes it hard to care about their fates.

The dialogue is another major issue, riddled with clichés and uninspired lines that fail to capture the epic feel of the Star Wars universe. Moments that should be filled with tension and drama instead come across as flat and lifeless. The series' attempts at humor fall flat and break any sense of immersion.

Visually, ""The Acolyte"" is inconsistent. Some special effects are impressive, but they can't make up for the lackluster set designs and uninspired cinematography. The series does little to explore new and exciting worlds, instead rehashing familiar settings without adding anything fresh or innovative. The production often feels low-budget, with cheap-looking costumes and lackluster practical effects.

The cast, despite their best efforts, struggle with the material they're given. Talented actors are wasted on poorly written characters and uninspired dialogue, resulting in wooden and unengaging performances. The chemistry between the leads is virtually nonexistent, further diminishing the series' emotional impact.

In conclusion, ""The Acolyte"" is a missed opportunity for Disney and the Star Wars franchise. It lacks the compelling narrative, strong characters, and captivating visuals that fans have come to expect. Instead of expanding the Star Wars universe in meaningful ways, it feels like a hollow, forgettable addition. The low-budget feel only exacerbates its shortcomings, making it hard to recommend ""The Acolyte."" Save your time and look elsewhere for your sci-fi fix.

In summary, ""The Acolyte"" feels like the worst Star Wars project since the Holiday Special. It changes the Star Wars universe, the nature of the Force, and the canon that has come before, written by people with no respect for the franchise. Poorly written, acted, edited, and paced, the entire show appears to be a vanity project full of self-inserts rather than real characters. The decisions made by the characters break immersion constantly, and the concepts introduced seem whimsical with no reasoning behind them.

The only positives are the production value, which is mostly okay for a show, along with the score and sound design. Sadly, the money spent on making this look and sound good is wasted on a poorly executed series. The dialogue is cringe-inducing, the story is confusing and nonsensical, and the acting is so poor it seems like the actors were found in a homeless shelter. Overall, ""The Acolyte"" is profoundly senseless and not worth the time.",1.0,11 June 2024

So what! Someone else mentioned negativity that it might be another mandalorian. I would be super thrilled if it was indeed another mandalorian. Bloody awesome show.

And when I say big, I mean having watched all the shows/movies/cartoons, bought books, buying every new lego set, watching short movies made by fans and enjoying having conversations with other fans about the Star Wars universe.

Having said that, this show is the WORST by far. First of all it is boring, there is no imagination just political agenda and the ""message"" , the writing is bad - very bad... Even worse the actors don't know basic things about star wars and are accusing the fanbase while saying that the show is the best in history..

This show is the final nail in Disney's coffin.

Surprisingly good!,"I went into this show with an open mind. Unlike much of the now toxic Star Wars fanbase (although I admit, I'm not a fan of the sequel trilogy), I have no issues with the leads casting or direction. I just want to enjoy another good story in the Star Wars universe, and feel we have been quite well spoiled with Star Wars TV content for some years now.

I read that The Acolyte was not shot on The Volume as a number of SW shows have been. I have no complaints about The Volume btw, but the difference can be noticed. There's a more immersive quality to the shots and scenes which is quite enjoyable.

It's fascinating viewing Coruscant and the Jedi Temple in earlier times, also interesting absorbing the culture of the Jedi with certain aspects recalling the Jedi culture in the prequel trilogy. Ranking hierarchies seem very prominent in their structure in this earlier period.

I love the Jedi costumes. Its a nice change, and gives a more regal look.

Sol is an instantly likeable and wise Jedi Master, despite being somewhat younger. He possesses some traditional qualities of a master, yet his character is meshed with his own empathy and uniqueness which I'm looking forward to seeing more.

The story reminds me of some classic Clones Wars style investigative episodes. Mysteries, clue seeking, chases and solid action (excellent fight sequences and great uses of The Force which don't seem forced and silly), and all the while we get to enjoy character development and some good backstory filling. I like the pacing - not too fast, and not too slow.

The ends of episodes 1 and 2 have mini cliff hangers, which engage and have us looking forward to the story evolving ahead.

There's a more classic Star Wars feel to The Acolyte, and I'm enjoying it so far. A shame we'll only have 8 episodes in this first season, albeit, this production has been done under a huge budget.

GREAT start!",9.0,5 June 2024
First two episodes,"Aside critic bombs first two episodes better than I expected. It wasn't bad at all. There are a few distinct charecters, story is fine, and not complicated, dialogs are fine. But of course we need to see next episodes for better judgement of the entire show.

Yes there are a few problems. Like some lame scenes, a few logical mistakes or the question in the space ""where were you last night""?. But those are not a critical problems can solve by next episodes.

What I have seen first two episodes is a decent starwars TV show. But Disney put the Leslie headland in a annoying position, Leslie also help them make it worse about his personal demonstration.

Overall lost interest in the first episode and really struggled through the second episode and from what I've heard won't be watching the third and I will just pretend that this pile of garbage was never made, I wish Disney would sell the franchise to someone who gives a dam and just go back to making movies that we can enjoy in the cinema and forget about our troubles for a few hours.",1.0,11 June 2024
Why Disney do you ruin everything?,"This should have been an effortless Home run. Veiled in mystery, suspense, and when the force was at its, strongest. But Disney took it upon themselves to use this as an opportunity to erode the very fabric of the beautiful story that is Star Wars. Casting was pitiful, Acting, it was subpar, and the script was simply atrocious. Disney, at some point has to realize that these beloved shows are not an opportunity for them to shell their ideas, but rather a chance to make magic. I had hopes that this show. Would at least have some glimmer of what Star Wars is but all approved to be was another Disney train wreck.

What in the hell is this?!,"Yet another awfully written Star Wars production, provided by the ever dwindling Disney Imperialists.

What is going on in the studios? Honestly. Did they begin employing children into the creative process because that's exactly what we've got. There's no logic or rational decisions made by any of the protagonists. It is a scrambled mess that shouldn't even be described as Star Wars.

I guess it all ended following Rian Johnsons 'The Last Jedi' And it's gotten worse and worse and worse and worse.

Sure, the visuals are decent, but that's where it ends.

The characters in this program are dimwitted idiots, who I guess aline perfectly with the IQ levels of its creators.

what happened to Star Wars,"I am not sure where to start with this series.

The writers clearly know nothing about star wars. The Jedi are weak, being bested by a child who can barely even wield the force herself.

The main characters acting is not great and same can be said about a lot of the cast. At times it seems like the actors are reading the script.

I wanted to like the series just cant drag myself to watch the rest. It almost seems like its a copy and paste with a slight variation. The critics scoring can only be coming from Disney themselves. Unfortunately in my opinion this is a series worthy of a skip and please dont even try a season 2.",3.0,12 June 2024
Ignore the negativity,"Honestly, I'm sick of Star Wars fans moaning all the time. As a Star Wars fan myself , I simply don't get this absolute ridiculous negativity around anything that's Star Wars related. This is a really good show. It's full of intriguing plot and cool characters. It feels like Star Wars and it's great to see a side to the Jedi set 100 years before the Skywalker saga. Can't wait for to what's to come and with two episodes down I'm pretty excited for more.

I felt the plot was interesting, the way the Jedi moves were very Matrix in style and it had me hooked from the start. What's not to love about seeing the history of the Jedi and how the Sith came about?",8.0,5 June 2024
Too much hate for too little of episodes,"What really disappoints me about the reception of The Acolyte is that it just goes to show that Star Wars fans can't give anything new a chance. Finally a show that doesn't focus on the Skywalker era, with all new characters in a completely different historical period in Star Wars History. The fact that just after 2 episodes setting up the story that the show has bombed in ratings is extremely dissapointing. After years of shows like The Book of Boba Fett, and The Bad Batch you have to give props for the Acolyte for trying to tell something original in a franchise that has been delving up old ideas for years at this point. Quite frankly, after 2 episodes the criticism is not deserved. The story has barely had anytime to get off the ground, and Star Wars fans should be more perceptive to being shown new stories.",6.0,7 June 2024
The Acolyte: A Galactic Disappointment,"The Acolyte, a show touted as a ""fresh take"" on the Star Wars universe, fails to deliver on nearly every level. Despite its intriguing premise, the series is marred by a plethora of issues, making it a cringe-worthy and unengaging watch.

First and foremost, the acting is atrocious. The performances are wooden, lacking depth and emotion, making it difficult to become invested in the characters' journeys. The dialogue is cheesy and clunky, often feeling like a parody of sci-fi tropes rather than a genuine attempt at storytelling.

Furthermore, the show's pacing is abysmal. The narrative meanders aimlessly, with long stretches of boring exposition and unnecessary tangents. The plot holes and logical fallacies are glaring, making it difficult to suspend disbelief. The characters are poorly developed, with too many quirks and traits that make them feel like caricatures rather than fully fleshed-out beings.

The show's reliance on sci-fi jargon and aesthetics is also overwhelming, feeling like a shallow attempt to seem intelligent and complex. The action sequences, while occasionally impressive, are few and far between, leaving the viewer with long stretches of dull, uneventful storytelling.

Perhaps most egregiously, The Acolyte fails to capture the spirit of Star Wars. The show lacks the heart, humor, and adventure that defines the franchise, feeling like a generic, low-budget sci-fi tale instead.

In conclusion, The Acolyte is a galactic disappointment, failing to deliver on its promise of an engaging and exciting Star Wars experience. With its poor acting, pacing, and character development, it's a show that's best avoided.",1.0,6 June 2024
Not a great start,"I have to agree that this series doesn't have a good start, but it's worth more those dramatic ratings. The good: I love the music, beautiful sets and costumes. They really put some love and care in those craftsmanship.

The bad: some poor performances, awkward dialogue and the editing feels rushed. Both episodes end with very short scenes doesn't really make sense. Above all I don't really feel we're 100 years before The Phantom Menace. I am not really sure why that is.

I just hope things are getting better since I really want to Iike this new adventure series in the Star Wars universe. But right now there isn't any character I am really invested in.",6.0,9 June 2024

Anakin's story arc has been for nothing,"I don't know why Disney is so dead set on destroying everything that made this franchise great. I understand that their business model is dependent on creating knew storylines and characters to make new revenue but why does it have to be on the expense of undoing everything that made the original characters and the Star Wars universe the franchise we loved. These narratives of inclusion and diversity were already built in to the Star Wars universe.

Garbage,"Unfortunately, Disney has ruined another show. ""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" sadly fails to ignite the force of excitement with its lackluster storytelling and uninspired writing. Despite the rich lore of the Star Wars universe to draw from, the show's narrative feels disjointed and underdeveloped. Characters lack depth, and their motivations remain murky throughout, leaving audiences struggling to connect with them on any meaningful level. The dialogue is stilted and often feels forced, failing to capture the wit and charm of previous Star Wars installments. Overall, ""The Acolyte"" disappoints with its subpar writing, failing to live up to the legacy of the franchise.",1.0,11 June 2024
What did I just watch?,"There is no way this could've been written by someone older than 12. It's baffling how it went through a ""rigorous"" approval process, with many people involved, and they thought ""yep, that's awesome, we're doing it!""

At first you'd think ""damn, that's the worst dialogue I have ever seen"", but then you'll quickly realize that the character motivations, and especially their actions, are much, much worse than the dialogue.

I have never much cared about Star Wars. If this was the first thing I ever saw about it, I would make sure to absolutely, under no circumstances whatsoever, ever see anything else in the same universe.

Disney what happened?,"I don't understand how Disney missed the benchmark on Star Wars. Literally when you watch the first five minutes, it's like bad diarrhea. Whoever directed and wrote the script needs to be fired. It doesn't make any sense at all. The storyline is off. Nothing feels correct and it's just way off from the original even though it takes place in a different timeline. They should've just stuck with The same characters, but not fall off, and I mean way off from the storyline. This series needs to be scrapped right away, and never be shown again.

Campy & Intriguing,"Once you relax into the look of the show being a big advertisement for the parks experience, it is pretty fun. Storyline is captivating with multiple major twists up front. Fight choreography on point! Sweet nods to the lore for anyone who has played Knights of the Old Republic. There's a stilted formality to the Jedi that seems intentional - like they are really trying to hit home that this is ""olden times"" - and that comes off a bit flat. Master Sol is the exception, giving humanity and focus to the show. Amandla is a powerhouse and Osha's skill sets are refreshing in a main character. Also, love the little mech tool droid, Pip. So overall, the first two episodes were entertaining! Excited to see where it goes.",7.0,6 June 2024
Lacking almost every way,"The effect shots and environments look great, that's about it. For all that budget spent Disney cheaped out on actors. I feel bad for Carrie Anne Moss being used as a marketing tool. The story tellng is absolutely awful, what even is the story.. someone wants revenge for something, dunno. I honestly felt like I was watching Star Trek, it does not feel like SW at all. Very wooden acting delivery. No idea where the story is headed and zero reason to care, zero likeable characters other than PIP. They didn't even do a good job of painting a picture of the timeline era. It's like the writers for SW content these days are not allowed to touch anything of consequence, the result is content that does nothing to further the greater story along. Really, is this the best ""story"" worth telling? I have no reason or desire to find out what happens next week.. I already know.. some stuff happened with some people, they all say things.. there was a robot and a laser sword, pew pew.",2.0,6 June 2024
A lot better than most other Star Wars series,"I am a huge Star Wars fan and I liked it. Full disclosure: I like almost all Star Wars, but there is a definite hierarchy in preference (OT is the gold standard). Also, Andor is the best series.

The acting/writing/feel of the first 2 epsiodes of the Acolyte are much better than Obi-Wan and Boba Fett series. The writing is better than Mandalorian (although I do like the Mandalorian). This does not quite reach the level of Andor, but it is more true to the Star Wars feel, a combination of Prequels and OT.

The Acolyte didn't cause me to cringe (unlike Obi-Wan/Boba Fett and even the Mandalorian on occasion), which maybe is a low bar (but even the prequels cause me to cringe sometimes).

I am looking forward to the rest and hopefully it remains similar quality.",8.0,5 June 2024
Star Wars tries something new,"The new show from a series newcomer starts with a mystery and competent antagonist with fun action.

From there, a new frontier is tested, party dialogue. This show writes a group of protagonists with dynamic and different personalities and believable motivations. The conversations between them are written well and performed better than most Star Wars series have had.

The action attempts to innovate new techniques for Star Wars and keep the Force feeling ever present.

A special shout out to the actor who plays Master Sol, as he feels like the most believable Jedi since Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn.

High Expectations and anticipations fall flat.,"I have watched all of the Star Wars shows be it live action or animated. When you watch those shows you always get a great feeling of SCI-FI, absolutely perfect action and acting they sort of attract you but this show the Acolyte doesn't seem to be belonging to that level, first of all the pace is uneven and acting is meh which are the building stones of the Star Wars shows and the plot is taking time to build story blocks in very short run times. People were waiting eagerly for this show because there were none live action Star Wars shows for some months, this is the first Star Wars series I watched seeking forward ⏩ and i am sad 🙁, may be we set the bar too high because of recently concluded Bad Batch but I don't know the Acolyte can stand besides any one of them.",1.0,6 June 2024

How this ended up costing 180 million dollars I'll never know.

The dialogue feels like it was written by me, when i was 10 years old. The story is incredibly predictable so far. The fights are kinda meh. The acting is really disappointing, altho it could be that it just feels this way because the dialogue is terrible.

If you're craving Star Wars content i recommend checking out some SWTOR cinematics.

Constantly making garbage,"I don't know how kathleen kennedy still hs a job after the complete garbage she has approved for release over the years. Star wars has been one of the most successful franchises in human history and now people think it is garbage. Ask a random person if they watched the new star wars and they probably have no clue it was even released, why? Because movie critics and the press constantly cover for the garbage the companies release, and no normal fan wants.

It couldn't be THAT bad... could it?,"I read the user reviews. I read the critics. I knew what i was getting myself into, and i still watched the first two episodes of the Acolyte. Sigh.

So much potential, terribly executed. I read so many comments comparing it to ""fan films"", and honestly, that's the best description. It was amateurish at best. Stale.

The writing is bad. The directing is bad. The acting is flat. What is the obsession with flat, emotionless Jedi?!? Being in control of your emotions doesn't mean you're emotionless!

I'll probably try to finish the series. But it will take effort. The Acolyte is marginally better than BoBF. Marginally. But that's not a high bar.

But i haven't been this frustrated with a Disney production since they butchered Willow.

With all the great stories and all the great storytellers who LOVE Star Wars and its lore, why in the world would they entrust it to a talentless hack like Leslye Headland?!

Shocking Writing!,"There is clearly an overall story that has had at least a little thought - but the internal consistency of the scenes and episodes seems almost made up on the spot...a mess of weird decisions, contradictions and coincidences...not just from the characters but...everything...it's like a parallel universe made up entirely of half-wits...

It's as if a certain plot point must be achieved each scene...but *how* that objective is reached and whether it makes sense in a functioning universe wasn't really ever given much consideration.

An important thing for writers to remember - even though the story may be fantasy or sci-fi...the world and people in it do need to behave congruently...unless there's a very good reason...

As it stands - the writing is reminiscent of young children playing make up...

The most bizarre thing - an awful lot of it would have been easily fixed without massively changing things...this is what re-drafts are for...did *anyone* even read this stuff before it was filmed???",1.0,10 June 2024
Beware of Jedi Snobs & just watch for fun like you did once,"It's Star Wars not The Passion of the Christ. Give it a chance I was engaged and enjoyed the first 2 episodes thoroughly. It's not Empire Strikes Back but if you just watch it for a bit of fun and don't expect too much then you will probably enjoy it. I thought the main character Mae was terrific and her opening fight scene with Trinity from The Matrix was epic.

Disney is just trying to get younger generations into Star Wars. If some kid watches this and decides they want to watch everything Star Wars has ever created that's awesome I reckon. We need as many Jedi Masters as we can get right now in this crazy world 🌍",7.0,7 June 2024
Don't waste your time with this one.,"The Acolyte emerges as a series that struggles to find its footing in the expansive Star Wars universe. The series' writing falls short of expectations, with dialogue and narrative complexity that seems to be written at a 4th to 6th-grade level, lacking the sophistication one might anticipate from a franchise steeped in rich lore and history.

Character development takes a backseat as the show prioritizes Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion themes. Causing the series to feel unbalanced, and overshadowing the potential for character growth and engagement.

The storyline itself is a convoluted web that leaves viewers puzzled rather than intrigued. Plot points appear disjointed, making it challenging to follow a coherent narrative thread. The acting, unfortunately, does not redeem these narrative flaws; performances come across as forced, failing to resonate with the audience or breathe life into the characters.

Perhaps the most disheartening aspect for fans is the show's departure from the quintessential Star Wars feel. Instead of the familiar galaxy far, far away, The Acolyte presents a universe that feels alien to the saga's spirit. It resembles a cheap imitation, a shadow of the franchise's former glory, seemingly designed to capitalize on the brand name rather than to contribute meaningfully to its legacy.

The Acolyte is a series that had the potential to explore new horizons but ultimately feels like an incredibly missed opportunity.

Don't waste your time with this one.",1.0,7 June 2024
A good effort!,"Two episodes in and I like it. Despite the dialogue, which is a little childish at times, there's a solid storyline that makes me want to see how it all turns out.

The set design is detailed and the special effects are good. I particularly liked the 'Trinity' opening fight scene with Carrie-Anne Moss, which had flavours of ""The Matrix"" to it.

What disappointed me is that two of the top billed actors (no names mentioned) are no more. One of the reasons I was looking forward to the show was because of these two actors. I can only hope that they find some way to bring them back into the series - maybe flashbacks, or resurrection, or something.

Anyone rating this 1/10 needs their head examined. Fans, they call themselves? If they were fans they wouldn't be shooting themselves in the foot and jeopardizing further series. Not to mention that said reviews are simply lies that are written by trolls.",7.0,6 June 2024
Epitome of Bad Writing,"The Acolyte is the worst writing yet! And that's saying something when you consider its peers amongst the long list of horrible flops that have come out of Disney in recent years.

And the plot has so many reckless holes in it, it's like no thought goes into them. It's like kids finger painting. Mindless, thoughtless, with no respect towards an intelligent story.

After the Last Jedi, Indiana Jones, Marvels, Madame Web, and the many many others that have preceded this new genre of Mouse Cheese Flicks...I'm done. I'm never watching another movie from Disney, Lucasfilm, Marvels again that was made after 1999. Im over it.",1.0,11 June 2024

The amount of absolute horrible business decisions that must've been taken in order to produce this absolute piece of garbage is astounding. If you think this is anything even remotely close to what Star Wars is all about then you are so severely lost.

Not only is the show not worth the watch, I don't think I will watch any new upcoming starwars shows. The only thing Disney has done right imo, is the Mandolorian and season 7 of the clone wars.

I have the suspicion that maybe (just maybe) people hate this show more than usual because all the main characters are people of color (I mean it's just a theory, can't prove it but is this really that much worse than ahsoka?).

A Star Wars adventure for young people, for adolescents. While previous ridiculous Star Wars works were not criticized this much and received much higher scores, I think it's artificial and perception management that this one is criticized this much.

"Somehow, Gaslighting is OK","The sheer hubris, the utter conceit required to say anyone who doesn't automatically love your take on Star Wars ""isn't a real fan"" requires a response, requires participation in the review damnation of this latest Disney anti-canon atrocity against Star Wars.

Calling someone that grew up with the franchise in such a way that if pressed, could write down three movies word for word with 90%+ accuracy, ""not a real fan"" is straight up just gaslighting.

Star Wars is goodies vs baddies. And as portrayed in Charlie Hopkinson's fantastic deepfake youtube videos, Deepfake Qui Gon - ""good guys always win, good guys always win, yeah!"" That's all you need for a Star Wars story. Goodies, baddies, and the goodies overcoming the baddies.

Turning the goodies into sort of baddies and the baddies into sort of goodies, this push to take a simple black and white formula and drag it into shades of gray because it ""undermines expectashuns"" - I find to be as deliberately stupid and infuriating as my misspelling of the word.

Why is this so cringy?,"Is it the abysmal dialogue? The bad writing? The ""acting? The unlikable characters? Why do the actors give of the impression that they don't care?

Serious question: Was this written by AI?

I don't know what I was hoping for. I really wanted to find something about this show I could like, I can't begin to tell you how much I've missed Star Wars, but it doesn't seem like it's ever going to be back. I'm sorry, I know you've read and heard it all before, but I've been feeling like a part of me has been missing since they took it away from us... maybe it's time to lay my hopes to rest.

Infantile,"I'm super disappointed that this was Lee Jung-jae break-out role into the Star Wars universe, because I really like him and feel like he would have been great if he wasn't sabotaged by this awful show. On-screen he seems to present a pretty likable person regardless of the role, so it seemed natural for him to play a mentor character.

Three episodes and the writing is already irredeemably juvenile. Audiences are bombarded with a wide cast of characters, and almost nobody likable to relate to is among them. This stuff feels like a fan project written by a bunch of kids doing self-inserts and going ""You know what would be cool?""

I don't understand why they didn't just make a martial arts show instead of Star Wars if that's what they wanted. I also don't understand why Disney keeps waterboarding its viewers with modern politics when people watch entertainment to distance themselves from the aggravation of politics.

Actually, I do. It's because everyone involved with this on a creative or administrative level is stupid. Just unbelievably stupid. Especially if they keep getting told nobody wants this, then they make it anyway and have the absolute gall to blame viewers for not liking their equally stupid and politically charged creation. This sucked, and I doubt I'm going to finish out the season.",3.0,12 June 2024
Disappointing Addition to Star Wars,"This was an overwhelming disappointing since my family loved the Mandalorian and Andor series and we were expecting something creative and engaging. Sadly, the dialog was predictable and tended to be boring to slog through. The set designs weren't very original with the typical remote outpost motif with a bit more color. No interesting vehicles or dress - just copied from previous Star Wars series with a few modifications. Boring.

I thought Amandla Stenberg did a credible job as Osha delivering the boring lines with a boring storyline well. However, her performance couldn't save this lackluster series start. Let's hope it picks up in episode 3.",2.0,5 June 2024
Fun take on the jedi,"It's time for Star Wars fans to accept that Disney will be Disney. Star Wars has changed. This is an action-packed show with fantastic choreography. We are getting a new take on the Jedi order, and I'm not seeing any real issues regarding canon. My only criticism is that the Jedi have been tricked a little too easily once or twice. Let's not forget our beloved original 6 movies had so many flaws with dialogue and CGI in the prequels, and the battle of Endor was almost comical. Fortunately, the story was fantastic in the original 6. The reality is this show would have much better ratings if there wasn't such a DEI discourse and if it was written by Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau.",7.0,11 June 2024

The set design is excellent - extremely good. The lead actress is excellent too. I genuinely can hardly fault the opening two episodes.

I cannot work out why there are so many bad reviews, all I can think is that there are a very vocal group of 'fans' who will downvote and review bomb anything new Disney release in the Star Wars franchise. These are the same people who downvoted Ashoka and Andor, both of which were very good.

The worst series ever made by Disney,"One of the worst series Disney has ever produced. Horrible dialogues, characters with no charisma at all. Boring actors, acting poorly and without chemistry, fights completely out of context. I'm going to stop watching after the second episode, I'm not going to waste time on that. I'm seriously considering canceling my subscription, as there are only bad films and series or ones I've seen before. Disney is terrible. How could George Lucas have sold such good material to be ruined, destroyed in this way by Disney? There is no way to believe that something good will be done for Star Wars. They ruined everything with this senseless militancy. We don't want to see ideology in films and series, we want to have fun, have a good story that encompasses what we had and not this rubbish that Disney tries to create. The only good things before the original films made by Lucas were the two seasons of The Mandalorian and ANDOR and ROGUE ONE. After that it just went downhill. Poor actress and producer, both of them clueless, in fact all the actors have no idea what STAR WARS is. I WISH AND HOPE THAT IT WILL BE CANCELLED.

Disney destroying and milking the franchise! Horrible,"Poor cast, poor script, bad acting, so forced, have seen high school plays with more believable actors.

Had optimistic hopes for the series, it's hard to watch. The dialogue is painful, would imagine they had a decent budget. However it resembles a third rate parking lot production.

A slippery slope loosing the remaining loyal fan base and with this abomination they are surely not gaining traction with the new generation. The props, choreography, wardrobe and props, lacking attention to detail. The sets look like a clothed miss match of junk. The makeup, well more of the same. Walt Disney would be rolling in his grave.

His legacy of meticulous and relentless pursuit of perfection is insulted, soiled and trampled.

A one star rating is far too generous for this waste time and money. Please Disney you can do much better than this awful production. You could have given the budget to high school or college students. They would have no doubt made a more entertaining job.",1.0,6 June 2024
All I'm asking is why,"I love Star Wars, I love the legacy that was created by Lucas, by all the independent authors whose goal was to expand the universe with versatile, creative and interesting stories. Perhaps this is what we deserve, maybe this is what we meant to get for being so unsure about the right path for the franchise, yet still the disappointment is so hard, even with no expectations. It's hard to find words. The Obi-Wan series was a huge let-down too, but it had its moments. If Disney says this is the upcoming era for the universe, I'm out. It could be that only the games have their potential to be a saviour for all of the real fans. However I'm here with lacking confidence, the damage has been done.",1.0,5 June 2024
Acolyte is something else!,"This series breathes fresh air into the Star Wars-universe. I love the old movies and i love the god old SW. Acolyte provides new and exciting story from long before SW as we know it. The characters is good as any earlier SW and they must be considered as a another age in the galaxy far, far away. By this is mean e.g costumes are great in the sense that they substinate for the timeline. Also it has great characters and great design. Great casting, great story that brings a sort of tension and unpredictable outcome. And also a good crime mystery. Take a deep breath and meditate upon this seires, and enjoy the magic that unfolds. This is a fantastic SW story that shows good directing and good writing, as well as cast ( it is good!), props/scenery.

Ok Star Wars story,"Only based on the first 2 episodes. It's not as bad as the review bombs. I don't think it's true Star Wars fans making these reviews. I fast forwarded through the first episode as I found it slow after the first fight, but watched the second episode fully. It really isn't that bad. People making these reviews sound like the same ones that hated on episode 1-3 when I was a kid. Star Wars has never been big on the dialing the whole time George Lucas was writing them and this doesn't feel much different. It's another Star Wars story and people should give it a chance and stop hating because we dislike those who make the decisions over it. I will definitely keep watching.

After watching the third episode it's still ok.",6.0,9 June 2024
Unwatchable,"Please someone take Star Wars, the best franchise in the history of cinema, away from Disney.

This series has fully departed from the original spirit of Star Wars. They managed to produce an extremely dull series, with no charismatic heroes, no surprises, no tension, and most importantly, no magic. It is really the best thing unfair to the fans of Star Wats all over the world.

It is impossible to care about the characters, there is no background, just a bunch of people interacting. The plot is not even worthy of a second class video game. Just forced scenarios, with no aim, no purpose and extremely poor acting.

Also, not even children can enjoy watching this. My kids have lost their interest in Star Wars. Star Wars has always been an amazing experience to share with kids, but the new format of telenovela has no appeal to children.

You don't necessary need famous and expensive actors to make Star Wars work. You need a good story and a casting that looks for talented, charismatic actors. The cast would be great for a FIFA or UN advertising.

Star Wars has a standard. It's movies were all brilliant. Some better, some worse. But there was a very high standard. Star Wars should not be used as a sausage factory.

I am a big fan of Star Wars and it really hurts to see what Disney has done with it.",1.0,10 June 2024
Really good show with fresh new ideas,"I love Star Wars since the 90s and after Disney bought the franchise even more. So I like the new stuff and The Acolyte is a good show, with good new ideas. 100 years before the skywalker saga. The jedi are in their best performance and the high republic have a golden age. We need a lot of more content like this. If you interested in the high republic, I can recommend you the books and comics. After two episodes I am looking forward for more. More jedi, more sith and maybe more easter eggs. :) I dont understand the hate. People destroy everything on their way nowadays. I am happy, because it gives a lot more people who like the new show.",9.0,6 June 2024
Please watch the show with an open mind,"So far the story seems interesting, and I care enough about the characters to want to know how the story will move forward, I want to know about the background of the protagonists and the masked villain. Like any disney+ show there are some flaws in the script, but they don't ruin the vision of the show. So for now the writing level seems higher than Ahsoka and Mando (I don't even consider BoBF and Kenobi). Obviously I put him under Andor.

What I find ridiculous is the attitude of the ""fans"" towards this series. Months before it came out, the web was full of videos and posts against the series, the actors and the director, without anyone having seen a minute of the series being criticized. With such a ridiculous starting attitude it's normal to see so many negative reviews (and I'm not counting the ones left before the show was even available, embarrassing) because people started the series thinking it sucked. The goal in watching it was therefore to search for any kind of errors, rather than watching the episode with an open mind.

Of course I'm not saying you have to like it, I'm just saying it's sad to see so much hate from a series that is definitely not the best Star Wars product, but for now it's far from the lows of BoBF and Kenobi.",7.0,8 June 2024
Boring (Avoid),"It's the same rubbish as the Fett serries but it's getting worse. Boring characters boring story. It's like it's trying to be generic as possible but is failing at even that.

"Why Disney, Why",,1.0,5 June 2024
Not good,"I think a 90s show could hold better than this. It just seems extremely bad. All the actors are terrible. The story line is very boring.

Disney's focus on profit over storytelling has led to a decline in the quality of the films and shows. The sequel trilogy, starting with ""The Force Awakens,"" seemed more concerned with recycling familiar plot points and characters rather than taking risks and pushing the boundaries of the Star Wars universe. This lack of originality and creativity left fans feeling unsatisfied and betrayed.

Additionally, Disney's decision to sideline the original characters, such as Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, in favor of new, less compelling characters further alienated fans. The mishandling of Luke Skywalker's character arc in ""The Last Jedi"" was particularly divisive and left many fans feeling betrayed by the direction the franchise was taking.

Furthermore, Disney's relentless merchandising and commercialization of Star Wars has cheapened the brand. The constant flood of merchandise and tie-ins has made Star Wars feel more like a cash cow than a beloved saga. This blatant commercialization has undermined the integrity and authenticity of the franchise.

Overall, Disney's mishandling of Star Wars has left fans feeling disillusioned and disheartened. The once-beloved saga has been reduced to a mere shadow of its former glory, and it is clear that Disney's focus on profit and commercialization has come at the expense of the storytelling and fan experience that made Star Wars so special. Again just very bad in general seems like goofs wrote it.",1.0,6 June 2024

Glad it's a galaxy far far away,"This show does not disappoint if you are looking for bad acting, horrible writing, and weak plot lines. It is obvious the director has never seen a Star Wars movie before being hired for this project, it lacks any relation to the source content and spits on the history of the franchise. Disney has decided to destroy Star Wars for the sake of DEI and pandering to a very small audience. The once beloved struggles of characters and their companions fighting for what is right and coming together is now gone. It is not about a strong female lead with her band of DEI misfits having not earned their victories by trial and tribulations but by just being marginalized . I would not recommend this series to anyone or Disney+.",1.0,7 June 2024
I'm intrigued,"The show kicked off with a great introductionary scene. I loved the little innovative things they added to your usual Star Wars formula, expanding the universe. Star Wars shows and movies often play it too safe making the world seem to be stuck in ""A New Hope"" time loop. Why would anyone want to watch the same thing over and over and over again?

All actors were great and I appreciated the slower pace in some parts. My only complaints are that the Jedi were disscusing their feelings for someone. I thought only the bad guys tap into that area?

And intriguing premise with great new characters, fights scenes and a story line that's easy to follow it's hard to find fault with this show. I'm also so glad they have finally stepped away from any of remnants of the original series, really great to see Star Wars stories that can stand alone, I really hope they continue to do so.

Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae) has been awesome, the effects, practical and CGI are great. I will say the mediocre acting mixed with the mediocre story are making me give this rating.

"Should have hired Filoni, Favreau, or Zahn...","Imagine everything you like about the Star Wars movies and the Mandalorian, and then remove all of those things minus lightsabers and space. The dialogue was awful, the characters were blah, the sound was bad, and the CGI was underwhelming (seriously the ships on Coruscant don't even appear to move). Every bit of progress that Andor, Ahsoka, Rebels, and even Obi-Wan has made to make us forget the Rise of Skywalker was destroyed. Fire the writers, bring in Timothy Zahn to write a script, bring in Filoni or Favreau to take charge of this. This is Disney's holiday special equivalent, and I am wishing this was aired one time so we could forget this existed. The Ewok movies were better than this... very disappointing. This seemed like a low budget Star Wars show, and I was disappointed it was this bad. I had high hopes after Ahsoka, but this is painfully bad. Disney's worst Star Wars entry to date. The only positive will be South Park parodying this.",1.0,7 June 2024
Just hire someone who actually likes Star Wars,"Judging by the 4 directors, it honestly seems like this was Disney trying to meet an inner company quota on hiring women & people of color. The creators being women and people of color is NOT why it's bad. But it shows Disney cares more about patting themselves on the back than creating something Star Wars fans love. Because those who were hired are famous for such hits as Russian Doll. Directing episodes of S. W. A. T and other procedural shows. Not a single director who has done anything close to this scale. Nobody with a vision.

People love Andor because Disney hired someone who's made huge films in this genre for decades and he had a vision. And it shows. Or when they hired Jon Favreau to do the Mandalorian. This show feels like it was made by people who never liked Star Wars. Just like Kenobi, just like Boba Fett.

All Disney has to do is call up any director who knows what they're doing and ask if they have an idea. I know for a fact I could do a better job than Kathleen Kennedy. And you, person reading this, probably could too.",2.0,7 June 2024

The actors' delivery is dull and uninspiring along with mediocre directing. For an initial episode the creators need to generate an emotional connection with the viewer. That is totally lacking in this show.

This will go down as a very expensive and forgetable entry into the Star Wars universe.

Acting is on the level of ""The Room""

Directing is on the level of Teletubbies

Regrets of a wasted time are on the level of Judas Iscariot betraying Jesus.

Logic behind everyone's action is nonexistent. Everything made for someone to magically appear in a place needed for a script to move forward.

High Republic era though didn't achieve a success in Star Wars fandom at least brought an interesting visual style to the universe but producers decided to put talentless broad of UCLA students into the uniform leaving only the room for a short laugh and a infinitely growing regret over a wasted time.

Not as bad as ppl say,"Star Wars is:

For children - the atmosphere is relaxed, joyful, and arguably simplistic.


An infantilized version of Dune.


Heavily dependent on budget due to the extensive use of expensive CGI. A Star Wars movie is far more costly than a regular movie filmed in a standard studio.


You can't make serious Star Wars movies with a Blade Runner atmosphere (I know they've tried) because it's too far removed from what people are used to.

If you want a serious SciFi - ask for a Dune series.

Who is the audience they are trying to reach? This feels more like a made for tv young adult novel than a Star Wars show. The actors have perfect hair with perfect costumes. The sets are too colorful and perfect to the point of being unrealistic. It just doesn't feel like Star Wars.

This series has time to turn things around, but I don't think it can. Can the writing, acting and directing all improve over the course of this series? Maybe, but I doubt it's enough to make that much difference. Yet another unnecessary waste that diminishes the Star Wars brand.",3.0,6 June 2024

"Deserves criticism in some places, but overall has been quite enjoyable.","Whilst some criticism for The Acolyte is understandable (a few inconsistencies here and there etc); I have found the show to be quite enjoyable. The new era definitely helps this. I find I'm not worried about how everything relates to the main saga or how it can hurt it. Instead I'm able to watch a Star Wars themed show without too many attempts to throw cameos at me or link itself to something else. I'm sure in time, it will do so, but for now the story feels relatively new. I haven't been awestruck yet, but I have managed to emotionally attach to the show's leads unlike other viewers.

The characters feel relatively settled in and although more development is needed, I'm sure that will come with time. Each episode has so far contained something intriguing or interesting to keep me attached. Though I am still on the fence about this series' potential, it still has promise to become a great show. There has been criticism that the show is overly political, though Star Wars has always been intensely political as most works of arts are. Whilst I can see some of the messages gaining criticism, I believe they are generally well wrapped in the narrative and do not splurge over into being clumsy additions unlike some previous works.

I do however, respect the criticism coming towards the show, I say all this as a big critic or Disney's Star Wars era, though I am of the opinion that the show's we have seen produced have generally been at worst ""passable"" and at best ""excellent (looking at you ""Andor""). In this sense, I find them a lot like the old expanded universe stories. Some are fantastic, some are good and some less so. Without George Lucas at the helm (with a strong team), the Star Wars we get now will be different and will definitely evolve. I just hope it ages gracefully.

I hope like me, fans both new and old will continue to view these productions with an open mind. This show represents a chance for Star Wars to grow. If this show can be nurtured and continues to grow well, we as current fans and new fans in the future can still have a chance at new Star Wars stories both with freedom to express whilst having loyalty to the original concept. It is in that comment I realise I'm perhaps being a tad optimistic. But nevertheless, I believe the show is worth a watch. It's an easy way for a new viewer to enjoy a Star Wars show without needing to know everything, whilst still having enough intrigue so far to capture an old fan.",7.0,12 June 2024

Don't agree with what everyone is saying. IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD!,"I don't want to say STAR WARS IS BACK but I'm possibly on a path to. I've only watched the first episode but here's my review already, and I think it's a good one so please give it a read. I'd like to start with what I didn't like since it, of course, isn't perfect but again, this is a review based off of the first episode only.

The first fight scene was quite obviously written with women empowerment in mind, which is okay since it also introduces us to the villain and was still bad-ass and fun to watch. It's just annoying as seeing women beat up men alone is no longer impressive or original and we've seen it so many times in Star Wars with the COLOSSAL amount of significant and powerful female characters, and so it's a shame that the makers of this show think that it's necessary to include such things with such intentions, and i'm pretty sure the makers of this show have actually said there's not enough women in star wars or something that proves a lack of interest in the very diverse franchise. I also don't feel like some of the portrayals are capturing the essence of someone that lives in the galaxy of Star Wars, and are coming across a bit too normal mostly because of how a lot of the characters are speaking quite common without any unique accents, it's as if there's been an influx in Londoners that have migrated to the Star Wars universe. One of the actors early on in the episode was literally doing soap-opera acting which was actually quite hard to watch. It's hard to explain but at the beginning, for example, Osha seemed a bit too ordinary, like someone you'd meet on the street or in a queue at Greggs, which is unusual to me for star wars where you have legendary beings with a powerful aura such as Obi-Wan Kenobi etc.

NOW! I cannot stress how much I am LOVING being back in the prequel era!!! 100 years is nothing in the timeline of Star Wars and so I'm feeling so close to the prequel trilogy in terms of characters, setting, CGI, writing and more. It's making me feel this real nostalgic joyousness. My favourite so far is, without a doubt, Master Sol. He reminds me a great deal of Qui-Gon, a wise jedi, not on the council, who doesn't always agree with their decisions and loyally follows the force that he is ever so powerful with, and it wouldn't surprise me if Qui-Gon was inspired by him. Moreover, the plot is already compelling me, and whoever has written this series should teach the writers of TBOBF or Mandolorian Season 3 some stuff. Right out of the first episode we already have layers of details about characters, a journey embarked on, mysteries to be discovered and questions to be answered, and I actually can't wait for the second episode which I'd like to watch right now, but I have an English GCSE tomorrow (I watched it anyway). The force is great as well! It's back to feeling like a mythical power that only the highly trained and powerful can weild, and not any old lump who closes their eyes and ""Trusts their instinct"" or ""Reaches out"" (""cough-cough SEQUELS cough-cough"").

All-in-all, it has serious potential, on a level no other recent star wars production has had, to be one of the greats, and I honestly think it's mostly to do with it not only being prequel era, but further back in time than ever before and IN LIVE ACTION! Hope it doesn't head downwards, but I'm keeping expectations low.",7.0,6 June 2024

Fanmade Projects are Better Than This Disater !,"Why can't Disney play Starwars the Old Republic for a few hours? The Old Republic is more modern than the High Republic... why?

The strand of the story is a disaster. Canon or Legends everything is ignored.. Why? Andor is more Starwars than this series... Money wasted for nothing.. Actually, again, pure framing for a better... When will Disney finally stop this?

It's always frightening when Disney runs like an elephant through the porcelain store and is surprised that many fans have no understanding of such content. Obi was already borderline but this series goes one step further.

Why not introduce some kind of compulsory reading in order to make Starwars at all?

They keep shoving these female characters with bad writing and script down our throats and then they wonder why we hate them and bash them.

After 2 episodes: we will see...,"I want to give it a 5 but I want to be positive this time, so a 6 that can go either way.

The scenes, settings, planets, costumes, ships etc. They all look like Star Wars, so that is nice.

The dialogues are just as clunky as Lucas himself would write them. Episode 1 stuff.

I must get used to the characters. I know that Carrie-Anne played in the Matrix. And I thought it was an inside joke to let the fighting look like the Matrix. But I see other Jedi do the same things. I like it that you see more of that side of a Jedi, but sometimes it feels more like ballet dancing then a real fight

I also like that you can see better that a Jedi has a lot of power. But sand is their kryptonite I think... (weird) And I like that the Jedi are having their noses up the air. They know everything better and always have something wise too say back.

I also like that they can put 1+1 together quickly. Not too quickly but also not dragging around. But still it feels dumb at some moments.

I think also that some characters must still get into their roles.

I do not want to go into details much because of spoilers. But let's see where this will go. The story is unfold, the pace is good, but if we keep chasing it will be boring quickly I think. But for now it feels fresh and new. It is not as bad yet as the Mandadorkian or Boobsa Fat and all the other forgettable Disney Star Wars stuff.

For me Andor was good and I gave Ashoka the benefit of the doubt with a six. I think this can be as good/bad as Ashoka. Ashoka was more epic, Acolyte feels more like a side quest. But who knows...",6.0,6 June 2024

So, what I mean, what's with the bad reviews? Just watch and wait how the story unfolds. I must say I was sceptical, even after episode 2, but episode 3 got me hooked. There some family stuff there, some pedagogical ideas and some Phantom Menace -like vibe... And twins with different personalities...

However, according to what i saw, there is no significant political messege in the show. The action scenes are better organized than other shows that disney made. It would be obviously a lie to say this show is very good or very bad, but i think it is worth watching.

At the same time they made boba fat series. They saw that it was a massive failure except for 2 episodes . They saw that colorful Piaggio hovering Vespas and trying to change this universe was a bad idea. Obi one was just ok... like the prequels. Ashoka was good kept to character more or less .

Is TV really this bad?,"The answer is a hard and resounding yes. I wanted so very much to like this and was looking forward to it. However, it is dreadful. The dialogue would have been better if it was written by a few high school seniors working on their final for Drama Class. The characters are generic and cardboard. Your not attached to anyone. I made myself watch the first two episodes, as no MLB was on HULU, heck I'd of taken WNBA at this point, and I literally didn't care what happened to a single character. Jedi are now Ninjas with Lightsabers. Because why wouldn't they now have abilities they've never had before. It's just horrid.

This is just genuinely so painful and sad to watch. I don't know how they can have such success with Andor and turn around to make something like this.

It's as if the writers have absolutely no knowledge of Star Wars lore and literally just heard the plot from a friend and are trying to make a series from that.

Also, the acting is so subpar that it's just plain cringe. Maybe it's from the stilted dialogue? But surely there are better actors they could have pulled with that kind of a budget.

About 3 minutes in, I had a profound epiphany; one that was unexpectedly lifestyle-changing.

"A solid start, not as bad as the poor reviews are making out","The most annoying things about the first episode - the young guy jedi - his acting is just bad, I guess he's there as eye candy for the main target audience.

Jesus have they not learnt from the dodgy physics TLJ was panned for?? Seriously people get the basics right!! Maybe get someone on staff who completed high school science?

Anyway apart from those minor niggles the 1st episode was surprisingly ok, it has a story, the 'message' is not as in your face (yet) as its been in the past if by no means as bad as other reviews have said! But its also a long was from being a 10 star as well, make of that what you will.

Convincing,"This episode convinced me and my opinion is different on the initial episodes.

The episode presents an excellent technical sector and the effects are very convincing; the sound sector finally gets into gear where in previous episodes it had lacked quite a bit.

From a narrative point of view the story holds up and it is clear that we have only seen one point of view of the story which we will complete in future episodes; the acting remains of excellent quality and even the two child protagonists, with the exception of some elements, are not unbearable.

Made for children,"Firstly, the look of the show is amazing, so props there, but as an adult, I prefer shows that have nuanced writing, strong acting and no 'cheese factor'.

So, when it comes to this show, who's it for? I think it's made for kids. And for that, well, then good! If you are a parent who doesn't mind your child watching some fantasy violence, then this is the show for your family.

But if it's meant for adults who are discerning fans of Star Wars and of well made shows, then this fails miserably. It feels as though amateur show producers, writers and runners where given a ton of money to make something incredible; and they fell short. As would be expected.

The show is sub-par, cheesy, re-hashed, unimaginative, and basic in every way. No offence to any precocious child out there, but the show will entertain almost all children that like this genre and they won't find a reason to complain about any of the above lol.

The acting feels flat, the effects are decent, at least disney is consistent with the quality of their special effects.

Uninspired and lacking energy.,"Star Wars under Disney has been a bumpy road. Sometimes great, sometimes only ok, too often a disappointment. The two first episodes of The Acolyte point in the direction of yet another disappointment.

Only two episodes in, it is too early to say much about the overall story. Maybe it will work and tie in with the existing lore, maybe not. As we have seen with the Kenobi show, to use one of the worst examples, sometimes Disney totally fail in making the story tie in with what we have already seen (A New Hope is clearly the first time Leia and Kenobi ever meet, and clearly the first time Vader and Kenobi meet since their fight in Revenge of the Sith). The story in The Acolyte takes place 100 years before the events in Phantom Menace and is supposed to be about the Sith if I am not mistaken. Let's see where that goes.

These two episodes are very uninspired and lack any sort of energy. First off, the acting is just not good. It is almost like the actors are rehearsing the scenes only, saving all their energy for a shot that never happened, or was left on the cutting room floor. They are going through their motions and their dialog without any conviction or energy, it is mostly flat and dull. Granted, not every actor in the history of Star Wars have been great, but this time around it is bad all over. Which makes me think the problem is probably not the actors themselves, but rather the director. But what do I know.

My second gripe is with the pacing of the episodes, sometimes it jumps back and forth between scenes without any purpose. I do like that they use some of the old ""swipes"" we know from the original movies though, a plus for that.

My third gripe is with the design of some of the characters. There are (so far) three characters that visually look like nothing more than regular humans on their way to a costume-party, rather than like characters in a Star Wars story. On one hand it is great that they mix new character designs with familiar ones (and as much as I liked Andor, there was a major lack of aliens and droids compared to human characters in that show), but these three only look like robed humans with a rubber nose (or ears or horns) and a lot of makeup on their faces. Nothing more. Total lack of imagination and effort from the design department.

Finally, I think the CGI looks far too much like something made with AI. Not always, but in some scenes.

I will probably watch a few of the coming episodes, to give it a fair shot, but this might very well be the first live-action Star Wars I will give up on. Dull, uninspired, and lacking any sort of energy and conviction.",2.0,5 June 2024
This is not star wars,"Where do I even begin?

Who green lights these shows? I was excited when I heard of the acolyte thinking they were finally going to focus on the dark side of star wars and make a mature, gritty and chilling show.

They've written so many books about dark side characters. Hell there's even a book of sith. So much info available. Only to be given this cute piece of trash

Like the acting is laughable, the plot makes no sense and the dialogue could be better if they got a bunch of 7 year olds and promised them ice cream. We are not babies Disney. Stop glamifying everything.

How is there fire in space? How did a jedi master get so easily distracted? It's literally part of their training as padawans to not be freaking distracted.

Good sis bad sis? Wtf is this frozen? How did mae free herself from the force pull / stasis she was under? How was osha moving so freely in a freaking ice planet?

I've been a Star Wars fan since the 80's and this feels like it could be in the Star Wars universe easily. The fight scenes are good the story intrigues me, the effects are top class. I liked it.

"A Disappointment in a Galaxy Far, Far Away","As a long-time Star Wars fan, I had high hopes for ""The Acolyte."" Unfortunately, this series has been a massive letdown, primarily due to its atrocious writing.

From the start, the plot feels disjointed and lacks the coherent storytelling that Star Wars is known for. Characters are introduced with little to no background, making it hard to care about their journeys. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and often feels forced, devoid of the natural flow and wit we've come to expect from the franchise.

The pacing is another major issue. The series drags in places where it should be exciting and rushes through moments that could have been impactful. Instead of creating a captivating narrative, it feels like the writers were more interested in ticking boxes than telling a compelling story.

Moreover, the show's attempts at expanding the lore fall flat. Rather than enriching the Star Wars universe, ""The Acolyte"" adds unnecessary complications and contradicts established canon in frustrating ways. This not only confuses long-time fans but also dilutes the essence of what makes Star Wars so special.

In short, ""The Acolyte"" is a prime example of wasted potential. Its terrible writing undermines what could have been an intriguing addition to the Star Wars saga. If you're a fan looking for the magic of the original trilogy or the depth of The Mandalorian, you'll be sorely disappointed.",1.0,5 June 2024
What have they done?,"Honestly, I went into these first 2 episodes hope-filled and wanting something--anything--good to come out of it. But what we got was nowhere near what I hoped for. I should have known better. On first watch-through I thought the episodes were okay, but after a second viewing I had taken off the rose-colored glasses and was more critical of what was on the screen. And.... I didn't like what I saw at all. By this point, we all know Disney has this history of ""Strong female character"" and ""dumb as rocks male character"" as valid concepts to build a series or movie on, but this is ridiculous. The Obi-Wan series was, I thought, the low point, but I was wrong. Book of Boba Fett beat it out. Then comes the Acolyte saying ""Hold my beer and watch this"" as it swan-dives into literal stupidity, bad acting, bad writing, and sets that look small and cheaply made. Where is the grandeur? Where is the ""Star Wars"" epic scope? Nowhere to be found. Normally, I save a ""4"" score for ""if only they tried harder, they would have been average fare,"" so this has to get a 3--a nice way of saying ""what the heck is this?"" Me and two of my friends, after a night of heavy drinking, could write a better episode than this with so little effort there would be more time for drinking when we were done with the first draft.

The Robyn Hood of Star Wars,"Sadly this is Star Wars' lowest point, 3 episodes in an I'm totally done. The writing is an absolute joke, nothing really makes an sense when you start to think about it.

One character will have a staunch position on something, state they refuse to change their mind then 6 seconds with another character they totally flip.

And then there's episode 3... well less said about that the better really. I'm just tired of this low brow, low effort nonsense by people with no actually passion and/or understanding of the IP they're butchering. What happened to all the good writers? I honestly thought that Robyn Hood show was the worst thing I'd ever watched but wow this has or is really close to trumping that.

Call me when you do another Andor or Mandalorian.,"The Acolyte is the latest in the deluge of Disney+ Star Wars prequels. Taking place 100 years before the original Star Wars. It follows the emergence of the dark side of the force within individuals in the times before the evil Empire.

Unfortunately this is yet another Disney+ Star Wars downgrade.

Where did they find these actors? Many, not all, but many of the performances here, including by lead actor Amanda Stenberg, they just sound like they are reading their lines off the back of a cereal box. I honestly can't believe they left some of the takes in the show.

The writing, as of the this review the first two episodes have been inflicted upon viewers and I honestly don't know what they are going for here. The writing is just bad in terms of the story and dialogue isn't any better. I don't understand why Disney is so against hiring actual professionals to make these shows.

Lastly, unlike something like Andor that was shot on location, this is yet another lazily crafted Volume Soundstage production with no sense of verisimilitude whatsoever.

I honestly don't know who this is for. In a cast full of teenagers and first timers, there isn't much of value taking place here, at least as of the first two episodes.

Phantom Menace vibe return Baby!,"Of the new SW series, this is perhaps the one that visually approaches George's vision.

The scenes are full of life and their colors are reminiscent of the prequel trilogy. The different planets are distinguishable and don't look contrived. The choreography is spectacular, yet the lightsabers have been deliberately relegated to the background so far. You can feel how the world is being built. The actors are present between the sets, not just playing in front of them like in Obi Wan Kenobi. Overall, it has a kind of Phantom Menace vibe cleverly mixed with Old Republic-like world elements. The only thing that is perhaps a bit rushed is the build up of tension, but that can only be fully appreciated once the series is over.

All in all, I've been waiting for a SW story like this for a long time. I love it.",9.0,5 June 2024
The start of a story,"I have watched the first two episodes and have some exposure to the High Republic content from books and comics. So far, I feel all of it is okay, but not yet exciting enough. I find the production values and cinematography high in The Acolyte, but I feel the story itself is bit rushed - the secrets are revealed too quickly and the story rushes from point to point. I would enjoy it more if it went at a slower burn from now on.

I appreciate some of the themes addressed in the Acolyte: it is clear it has a more critical take on the role of High Republic Jedi as police, a logical step given what we have seen in the sequels. There is a good conversation brewing about who deserves and wields power, and I hope the rest of the series continues to explore that.

I also want to address the number of bogus reviews I've seen on this site. The embarrassing identity politics and culture wars some fans are waging are nonsensical. I get a bunch of angry men are trying to push algorithms, but their criticisms are more reflective of their ignorance than any critique of the show.

It's like I gave my 10 year old a lot of money to make a Star Wars film.,"Visually it was looking good, but the direction and acting of the majority of characters was pretty bad to say the least. There was one scene where you can completly tell one of the actors slipped up on their lines, and it was left in - maybe they thought it was endearing.

Also, without any spoilers, a few scenes did not make sense on the direction ideas. At one point, my wife and I looked at each other saying, ""that didn't make any sense why she would be left on a transport jailer ship controlled by droids when she was so high profile..."" Where did the Jedi's go that brought her to justice? Weird.

Seems the focus was more on the ""agenda"" and ""look what I can do with all this money"".

Like my subject, you can tell there is a lot of money and marketing backing this project, but a huge miss on the acting and directing. Maybe it gets better in the next 6 episodes, but we will see.",2.0,6 June 2024
It's the writing for me (Primarily),"Star Wars The Acolyte feels like a child, watched Star Wars, and then said ""hey, I can write something dark and edgy and make a really serious Star Wars show!"" And unlike Most who wrote horrible fan fictions when they're in middle school and have them end up stashed away in some drawer, this child had a daddy with a lot of money and decided to turn it into an actual show.

For a show that is naming itself a thriller, there is not much to feel thrill towards. Everything is just told to you. No need to put the pieces together or try to solve it yourselves. Everything is solved for you.

This leads to my main issue: the writing. Character dialogue is unnatural, and everyone talks like imbeciles. There is little to no suspense: Star Wars was truly placed in the wrong hands here.

In an attempt to make a mature Star Wars show, Leslie Hedland has made a comedy, and unfortunately, one that isn't very funny.",2.0,5 June 2024
Sigh..... I just wanted Star Wars,"I mean they were handed one of the best stories and franchises in the history of the world, and they just threw it away. Instead of taking the story line and making a compelling show that the audience (who is extremely loyal to the Star Wars universe) would enjoy and understand, they hired a bunch of people who have no clue about Star Wars. Why in the world would you get people on the project that are not interested in Star Wars? The main actor was talking about how Anakin blew up the death star and at least one of the writers had never seen the show. I think we all know why, but that's an argument for a different platform.

Overall, this is a travesty in terms of screenwriting and an actual show. The attempt to introduce a story line that is strictly to comply with a subsect of societal norms is astounding, but given it's Disney, not surprising and in line with Disney's work in the past few years.

All we can hope for is that the terrible ratings and reviews of this show will send a message to Disney leadership to stop with the shenanigan's. Probably not, they are in their own world thinking they are doing 'good' things.

Oh, and we should all start a petition to strike acolyte from Star Wars lore. This is potentially one of the only redeeming actions available for this historically fantastic Star Wars Franchise.",1.0,12 June 2024
This is not Star Wars.,,1.0,5 June 2024
Appalling!!,"What have you done Disney??!!

The lack of diversity in this show is abundant to see, you have clearly targeted a community who have no interest in the show and your loyal followers have not been engaged whatsoever.

Disney really needs to rethink the direction in which Star Wars is going here before it becomes too late. Star Wars fans are slowly starting to turn their back on the enterprise as a whole!

The show demonstrates the visual affects can be achieved to a high standard, which is a shame because a decent director could have made something special here! Please please go back to the drawing board Disney and have a long hard look in the mirror.",1.0,7 June 2024
Strong Start,"While not as strong of a premiere as a show like Andor this is a pretty good start. Actual sets, camera movement, and actors emoting in a Star Wars show again is nice compared to disasters like Mando Season 3, Ahsoka, and even Tales of the Empire. I hope they manage to keep things interesting as we learn more about our characters and the mystery widens. Amandla does a good job at portraying two characters as they feel pretty different from each other. Sol feels like the ultimate Jedi dad we all wish we could have, and I'm curious to see how the rest of the cast is fleshed out. It's nice to have a Star Wars show that's all new characters, mostly new locations, and isn't pandering to the audience by throwing recognizable things in their face.",8.0,5 June 2024
First 2 episodes seemed okay,After watching the first two episodes. The show has some promise. It's not the best thing I have ever seen but not as bad as the other reviews would have you believe. I'm a firm believer in give a show 4 episodes to really rate it so I can't say for sure how I feel for two more weeks but the first two don't have me not wanting to watch the rest. The show actors are doing a good job and the script although it's a little cookie cutter it's not as bad as many shows that have recently come out that I'm convinced AI must have written them. So my over all rating is TBD I'll give the first two episodes a 7.,7.0,12 June 2024
Against my better judgment.... And it's bad,,1.0,5 June 2024
"It's good, not great, but I'm hopeful.","It's not great, but it's definitely Star Wars. This tale is set 100 years before all those events we all know. And it's refreshingly different (which is ticking off a lot of purists). There are things to love here: different types of Force users, different species, kung fu, a mystery to solve. There are things to hate here: Star Wars physics (a fire extinguisher in space?), Star Wars fan services (""bad feelings"" ugh), and Star Wars-grade acting (*sigh*). The core of this is oddly VERY Star Wars: it's a cheesy, space opera fantasy roller coaster concerned with cool action, cinematic set pieces and feel-good YA emotional underdrama than SCIENCE and canon-building. The question Star Wars asks is, ""did you have fun?"". The answer after watching three episodes is a resounding ""yes"". Was it the BEST ride? No. But it was and is cool and it was and is DIFFERENT. For that alone I give applause.

Solid 7 thus far. Totally watchable for folks who have gone too long in the SW ""safe zone"" but not quite edgy or tight enough to be thoroughly satisfying. Fact is, most of the SW universe stuff is worse than this so I'm having fun and looking forward to the rest of the episodes.",7.0,12 June 2024

Complete disaster of a show,,1.0,12 June 2024
Wooden and disjointed,Where to start. The story hasn't been fleshed out properly and you just have to presume/assume certain things as the show moves along. Fight scenes are a bit wooden and predictable. We appear to be going over old ground (again) with a slight twist. I'm surprised that Carrie Ann Moss and Lee Jung-jae are in this. They both have started in much better movies/TV series. I'm sure the 'new' Star Wars fans will find it good/entertaining. I wanted to like it but it makes Ahsoka look good and that was stiff and slightly lifeless at times. Fingers crossed they don't messed up series 2 of Andor. It might be time to give Star Wars a miss from now on.,3.0,6 June 2024
Disappointing Journey to the High Republic,"I waited for episode 3 to review this, to give it a proper chance, and unfortunately things only got worse. A blundering story that feels like a fanfiction, this largely flashback episode, episode three tacks lore into the world that doesn't really feel like it fits - even moreso than the previous additions where no effort was made to weave the ideas into the setting cohesively.

While boasting good cinematography, makeup, costumes, and occasionally impressive special effects, this Star Wars series suffers from numerous issues that undermine its overall quality. The pacing is uneven, rushing through the setup and then slowing to a crawl with an extended flashback episode. Many of the action sequences feel choppy with too many cuts.

The acting is largely mediocre, with most performances coming across as either phoned-in or overacted. A major bright spot is Lee Jung-jae as a compelling Jedi master who outshines the rest of the cast. However, the dialogue he and others have to deliver is often corny.

Beyond the acting, there are jarring inconsistencies in the lore, action, and plot that pull you out of the experience. The attempt to reimagine the Force and Jedi as more martial artists than monastic guardians strips away some of the mystery. Additions like ""witches"" feel tonally inconsistent with the established Star Wars universe.

While ambitious in trying to depict the High Republic era, the series lacks a clear creative vision. Rather than deepening the lore, it often comes across like a kitchen sink fantasy or fan fiction disconnected from the core themes, lore and tone of Star Wars as a setting. With some more experienced actors, tighter writing, and a firmer grasp of worldbuilding, it could have lived up to its potential. As is, it ends up feeling like a B-grade 80s/90s TV series or even a stage play rather than being actually immersive.",4.0,12 June 2024
Disney hates its fans and seeks to destroy Star Wars,"I honestly didn't think it could get any worse than it already was, but Disney never ceases to amaze me in how they can buy franchises and destroy them faster than Microsoft can. Don't watch it. Everyone hates it. The writing is terrible. The ""detective work"" is something that wouldn't even hold water in a hardy boys book. Please don't watch it. You will wish you had that hour of your life back. The main character is not an enjoyable character. Did they even test this with audiences before release? The trailer has around 20,000 likes and almost 300,000 dislikes and yet they are touting it as a huge success. It is garbage. Disney hates it's audience. Don't waste your time.",1.0,13 June 2024

"So far, so okay...","Nothing remarkable, typically beautiful production if a little samey by now, the sets are very reminiscent of Obi Wan for instance. The writing is again very reminiscent of recent Star Wars projects and the story so far very predictable, there may be twists yet to come? If so I'll amend my review but 2 episodes in nothing so far to be excited about.

The usual crowd are bombing 1star reviews but I think we've all got used to ignoring them by now, it's a fair modern outing that has suffered from over hype.

Overall, I love my star wars and Disney has done some great stuff, but the series are, for me, becoming a little over familiar, the much hyped change of writers, characters and directors hasn't done much to change things up.",6.0,5 June 2024
Terrible Writing,"Call me crazy, but imho the base stone for every good TV show or a Movie is a clever well written script, ideally with some interesting twists. There should be memorable characters that audience can connect to in one way or another and the casting should fit the characters. And then the audio-visual and theme side of things is just the icing on the cake.

BUT HERE :) its the complete opposite so far. The only good part is the theme and audio-visual effects, without it, it would be basically unwatchable. The script is terrible, feels like it was written by a kid or some free AI. The story is highly predictable, I was not amazed or shocked by anything... quite the opposite actually. And the characters are just boring, I don't care about anyone after 2 episodes in.

Like who thought this show was a good idea? Why Disney wastes their resources on this?",1.0,11 June 2024
Interesting addition but lacking,"Overall, I'm enjoying the characters (Sol, Jacki, and Yord) and designs for this era. However the story so far (2 eps) has felt very watered down and predictable much like parts of Ahsoka.

Amandla's performance has been great and the character she plays is interesting, but is a victim to the writing, which disengages you from thrill you should have while watching her character. I do hope this changes with the story progressing as she has so much potential as a character, but also as an actress that they are not leveraging.

With there era we also get a glimpse of a new fighting style 'Force Fu' which I have some mixed feeling on. The shots look cool and it can 100% exist within the universe, but how it's executed in the show comes off like a 2000 action movie, pulling you out of the emersion in Stars Wars uni. Visions managed to introduce news things and while making it feel ground in the universe.",7.0,5 June 2024
"Started off 'okay,' then episode 3 demolished all hope.","As a huge fan of anything Star Wars, I can honestly say that this series lacks any imagination. The first 2 episodes were decent enough to make me continue to watch.... But the 3rd episode was simply just RIDICULOUS. They've turned the series into a FAN FILM!?!? This belongs on YouTube.

If I was rating the series based only on the cast, the sets, & special effects, I would give it a 10/10.

The writing alone, drops the rating of this series to a 3/10.

They've managed to reduce the series into what appears to be a bunch of cosplayers, quickly reading a high school level script, performing it immediately after reading, while one of the cosplayers recorded it and released the footage to the public.

I will continue to watch the series because I am a Star Wars completist, but my hopes for the show to redeem itself, is extremely low at this time of this review.",3.0,12 June 2024

Shameful,"Could not watch beyond first scene, it's like a fan made series from someone who doesn't like or understand starwars or entertainment for that matter. You can't make a series good just by dressing the character in obiwan style clothes the dialog is a joke. The series is so cringe, it's so sad that they keep destroying platforms that have the potential for great entertainment. First Marvel now starwars. Mandalorian and Andor were great but this was terrible. No good dialog just fight scenes. Like mixing Boyka with barbie. Sad just sad don't they pre screen?

Terrible in every respect...,"This is the absolute worst Star Wars content ever made. The horrific acting, dialog, and story are too poorly done to put into words.

Its shocking that they still do not know how the force works...even after all of the mistakes they made with it.

Episode 3: The dark side of the Jedi,,,13 June 2024
Star Wars is made for Cinema not TV,"I think my issue is that Star Wars is a cinematic experience. I enjoyed Ashoka, Andor, Kenobi and most of mandalorian but overtime I felt all of these should be condensed into a film.

The most I have felt this is with The Acolyte. Both episodes are way to short. By the time you start getting into it, it then cuts to the credits.. The characters aren't so likable just yet, but I do like Master Sol. I just feel like this would have been better as a well thought out film than TV show.

Disney loves their TV shows at the moment and I think they need to get back to the big screen. Take chances and create something great to show us all and stop being afraid of the fan base. Get away from the Skywalker era and create films within the high republic era or way after the Skywalker saga.

I want to see STARS WARS show it's fantastic self at the cinema again. There isn't much time to get invested in these small episodes.",7.0,7 June 2024
Dialogue and direction are rough,"I wanted to like this, I really did. But the first two episodes were hard to watch at times. The Star Wars universe has certainly had it's share of bad dialogue in the past (""I hate sand""), but this felt worse because the dialogue combined with the direction came off as over-serious and looking like the scenes should have been in a space-based soap opera.

The pro for me was the fight scene, specifically the first episode, but after that the scene it got more and more soap-operaish or maybe like a WB teen drama. And I say that as someone who enjoyed some of those high school dramas.

The only hope is this gets better. Unfortunately, I've gone from excited to meh about the remaining 6 episodes.",3.0,5 June 2024
Rough start but unfolding into something more,"This show so far feels targeted to a younger audience with how the characters are presented and communicate. The plot of the first two episodes follows a fairly generic story of 'revenge' in a star wars skinned environment. The sets were good but not as intricate or immersive as previous Disney SW shows such as the Mandalorian or even Ashoka which were on very different planets making each feel new and different.

The story is set well before the Skywalkers so the force is quite different and I would expect there to be new things we haven't seen from the movies. I have noticed acting of the younger cast is a bit off and forced. Dafne has had much much better performances but here she most certainly not exhibiting behavior and speech of padawan quality and acts like a teenager resulting in a weird vibe (like she is geeking out at the same time and unable to get into character). Lee Jung-Jae has really good English pronunciation that I was surprised only having seen his Squid games and he has developed his character really well and does make the show more interesting.

Don't love it yet but don't hate it and am still interested to watch more. Feels more disney than lucasfilm so far. Is it something that keeps me on edge for the next episode? No.",6.0,10 June 2024
Expectations vs Product,"A review after only the first two episodes. Pending the entire first season.....

Wobbly beginning to this show. Hopefully it gets better. Didn't like the kung fu matrix in Star Wars. None of the main characters are particularly interesting.

I liked the impenetrable sleeping monk jedi idea, but now he's dead. Would've been cool if they used him a little here and there across the show, in various settings and situations happening around him, with him remaining an impenetrable sleeping monk jedi.

A lot of sub-par writing and general plot contrivances. It's not high end, this show not meant to be that, more back to the usual adventuring and mission of the day type stuff.

But there's potential for it to hit those marks IF it delves into the actual Acolyte herself, her master, his world.

Seems so far that they are not the centerpiece of the show, but tha background storyline and characters to drive the focus on the jedi master and Osha.

My expectation for this show before it released was just that....that they'd finally showcase the dark siders, their world, their struggles and everyday stories. So that will be my interest moving forward, hoping they do that.

As it is, my only interest is learning more about the Acolyte herself and who her master is, and seeing emphasis on them.",2.0,7 June 2024
Incredibly poorly written,,2.0,10 June 2024
Missed Opportunity!!!,"I really wanted this to be good. The CGI and sound was great but the story just blows apart anything good about the show. The dialogue is terrible and the characters feel wooden. Ive read some of the 10 reviews on here and really don't understand where they are coming from. I'm left to believe that this might be a generational thing. The older generations expect things to improve over time. The younger generations seem perfectly happy will terrible storytelling and writing. Perhaps because of the way we enjoy media now. Our brains are simply wired differently. This had the feel of fan fiction, I found myself asking the whole way through the two episodes. Why? Why that language, why that choice, why that angle, why, why why. The thing that really annoyed me though where the Jedi. They didn't have the gravitas you would expect. You see glimmers of it in carrie-anne. And master Sol. But just as quickly it's gone and the drudgery continues. This was a slog and I'm not sure I'm up to watching the rest. Please Disney, find better writers!!",1.0,5 June 2024
Why?,"Just another attempt to send an activism message using something beloved from the past. But in the case of Star Wars, we already know.

Besides that, the script is lame, the fighting is dumb, the acting is stiff and from the first two episode, we know it only getting worse.

Its getting to a point where they dont even try to write something even average. Seems to be that scripts that in past would only make it to low budget VHS movies, now get visual ""quality"" in streaming and trick people into thinking it is premium content but its almos a soap opera with FX, which in fact are actually really, REALLY expensive. What a shame.",2.0,6 June 2024
"Boring, bland, ...","Its hard to write a review without hitting spoilers but its amazing the low production value of this series.

The dialog is feel like its written for children, trying to exposition dump so much information that the characters are supposed to know but is just dumped for the audience with no real integration in the storyline. There are no attempts made to have the audience guess, no, its verbatim told again, and again ... There is no ""there is another"" (OJ Star Wars), no, they go so fast from 0 to 100, that your head can not turn in time.

We have master Jedi losing fights in ways that can only be described as ""wtf"" (like they nerfed Jedi Int and abilities down to 2/10). Characters that seem to know about Jedi secrets and how to exploit them, where you again need to go ""wtf, that makes no sense"".

The acting feels bland and more what your expect from cosplay actors (and to be honest, i have seen WAY better cosplay then this series delivers) in its two episodes.

The interaction between actors feels awkward, like strangers talking to each other, when they are portrayed as friends of good collogues.

There are issues with sense of time, like they tried to rush so much in a few episodes, that there is a issue in several scenes with the flow of time.

Confrontations that make no sense if you look at the flow of time and how people travel. Even more so is some of the witnesses of a crime, yet, no thought was placed into a counter of innocence (trust me, think about that scene for a few seconds, the location, ... how is X guilty and yet, the location and time) yet, the Jedi intelligence is again 2/10 ...

It feels like a bad Disney theme park and to be honest, i have seen way better acting from those parks.

Do not see how this can even be considered this 10/10 with a scalding ""you are not a real SW fan"" for not giving it a 10/10. Has our standards dropped so much? Or are we looking at paid bot accounts because something feels off. Are people that desperate for any SW content, that they ignore the low standards being shown.

Yes, its not Andor, but compared to Ahsoka.(a heavily flawed serie), it makes Ahsoka look like a masterpiece... Despite all its logic flaws, the acting was actually good (for the most part).

If you where to write bad fan fiction, have it acted by teens with no acting experience on a massive budget, that is how the Acolyte feels like with its two opening episodes.",3.0,5 June 2024
I love it,"It has everything I expect from Star Wars: TLDR: padawans, laser swords, the force, jedi, the dark side, robots, spaceships, nice plot, multiple layers of story lines with something new and unknown so far for the star wars saga.

Thank you Disney.

LONG VERSION: The journey of Padawans training under the watchful eyes of their Jedi Masters, wielding laser swords with precision and grace. The Force, ever mysterious and powerful, plays a central role, guiding the destinies of both Jedi and the dark side. The eternal struggle between the both sides unfolds with intensity, bringing a fresh perspective to the Star Wars saga.

Robots <3 Spaceships <3

The plot is engaging, with multiple layers of storylines intertwining, creating a rich tapestry of adventure and intrigue.

What sets 'The Acolyte' apart is its introduction of something new and unknown, adding depth and excitement to the Star Wars universe. The characters are compelling, and their journeys are both personal and epic in scale.

Where's Yoda?,"Two episodes in and I realise that Frank Oz hasn't made an appearance. ""700 years old I am, look as good will you not?"" In cannon Yoda should be part of the Jedi Council, but has been a no show as of yet.

Otherwise? This isn't too bad of a show. I'm looking forward to the rest of the episodes, and will continue to just enjoy the ride.

One thing that is really cool is the inclusion of twins. I reckon that this may be a nod to Timothy Zahn and the ""Skywalker"" twins that never showed up in the sequels. It also plays on the ""good twin, bad twin"" tropes, and I can tell you as a parent to twins, that trope isn't always true.

Honestly this series is so bad I have no interest for the characters or the plot.

It is a same that Disney considers us mindless fans that would applaud any stupid idea is being pitched in their corporate office. Lack of respect to people that actually buy merc or pay subscriptions.

Thank god my subscription ends tomorrow. I will not have to see the rest of the series.

As a final note, script is a mess, characters are out of character most of the time and special effects remind me some b-series of the 00s

Star Wars is back!!!,"Been excited for this for awhile and it didn't disappoint. Amandla Stenberg and Lee Jung-Jae were great in their roles, had a few flat characters but more to do with the characters than the actors themselves. Fight scenes were awesome, can't wait to see some full on lightsaber action though.

Dialogue isn't up to Andor standards, but is by no means terrible. Nice to see them not relying on the volume and most of the sets and production design looked great. The series score is another high point and feels like proper Star Wars. All in all I found it a thoroughly enjoyable romp around the Star Wars universe and can't wait for the next episode.",9.0,7 June 2024
Better than expected,"I've watched the first two episodes and it was better than I expected. Is it great? Is it with rewatching in the future? I don't think so. But it seems like this will at least be a good one-and-done series.

What do I find good?

The actions sequence are generally well done. For obvious reasons early on, I got a Matrix vibe. And the action continued to be top notch throughout the two episodes.

Costuming is also pretty good, although there seemed to be some corners cut here and there. They were obvious.

The variety of environments and creatures was also fun. But again, there seemed to be some corners cut on creature effects.

What did I find bad?

Unfortunately, the main actress who plays Osha/Mae is very wooden in her acting. For an actress playing a character expected to convey emotion through her eyes in many scenes, she simply isn't up to the task. You get one intense stare from her in most scenes. And to be honest, even without the mask, her facial expressions remain mostly one-note.

Osha and Mae's hair... These two characters don't know the other is still alive initially. And they haven't seen each other in at least a decade or more. Yet the have the same hairstyle? And a distinct hairstyle at that. It seems lazy not to change up their look between the two characters at least a little.

And that leads me to my last gripe. There's just no subtly or imagination in this series so far. So that makes me worry that they're more interested in getting to some end goal and didn't give enough attention to the details as a result.

I'll hold it hope that some of these complaints are addressed as the series progresses. In particular, I hope Amanda Stenberg relaxes into her roles at some point.

Overall a generous 6/10, but that will change if things don't improve.",6.0,9 June 2024

This isn't Star Wars,"Well, maybe it is the new Star Wars, but it isn't what Star Wars used to be. That's not a good thing either. Inauthentic and immature script. Acting and casting choices cast doubt on the credibility of the show and it's just not enjoyable to watch.

Disney seems bent on making Star Wars something that it's not and this series is further proof of it. There may be some of you out there that will enjoy this but if you are a true Star Wars fan and enjoy authentic, genuine story telling, then this isn't for you.

Disney why?,"Why would you set this in a universe that it's not fit for? The name Star Wars does not mean anything anymore.

Overall, ""The Acolyte"" lacks the heart and soul that fans have come to expect from the Star Wars universe, making it a disappointing and forgettable entry in the saga. The pacing is erratic, dragging through exposition-heavy scenes and rushing through moments that should have been pivotal. The visuals, while occasionally stunning, are inconsistent and marred by uninspired set designs and special effects that fail to capture the magic of previous Star Wars installments. I hope Disney will sell it to people who care.",2.0,10 June 2024
Awful,"This is terrible! I can't believe people are giving this a 10 rating! This series isn't even star wars. It doesn't even feel close to being in the Star Wars universe. The writing is amateurish at best and the acting is poor. You don't care about the characters or their consequences. The story is generic and boring and slow paced and simply convoluted.

I'm still going to watch the next episodes hoping it gets better but I seriously doubt it will.

The one thing I will say is impressive is the visuals, it's obvious where the money has been spent in that regard.

I really hope they go back to traditional values within the Star Wars canon and stop disrespecting the Jedi whilst also limiting the amount of series and stories. Less is more and the last three series instalments have done enough damage already. Real fans are tuning out and if this has occurred a long time ago in a galaxy far away, why are they over extending current social progression and ideals?

I will give my time to anything in the Star Wars universe. It's not on the level of Andor or Mandalorian, but do your best to keep an open mind. There are still many episodes for them to make improvements, but it's unlikely for anything drastic to change since the main problems appear to be intrinsic.

Has the right feel for Star Wars - Saturday matinee adventure/mystery,"The Acolyte (2 episodes in) has the right feel for Star Wars in the sense of a Saturday matinee adventure/mystery. There is a mix of sudden reveals and cliffhanger endings with a sense that one will have to go back and rewatch the series to catch missing hints and details. Like the best Star Wars, there should also be a sense of the mythological or archetypal (as in Joseph Campbell), and there are set ups in the first two episodes that look very promising once you pause to think about them.

""Your eyes can deceive you-- don't trust them"" appears early as a major theme, and among the hints for how to decode what you are watching in the plot. Things are not what they seem, and implications will unfold in layers.

This is better storytelling than other recent SW content like Ahsoka, which feels more like a lot of ponderous moving of characters around like chess pieces into positions for some future story to be told that we have to wait for (another season, another movie), while throwing in some references to past SW characters and events, like being tossed candy to keep you satiated, but altogether serving no greater purpose, making for a less satisifying story.

Even though the production design in The Acolyte looks smaller (no big set pieces or space battles so far), the universe feels bigger, with new aliens, new tech, and new ideas about the Force. The universe should feel big enough to be filled with suprises, even to civilizations that have existed for a long time, like Europeans discovering the Americas (the people, their cultures, and all the new natural life), opening up all sorts of expanded understandings of the world, but also leading to fear and uncertainty and paths of destruction. My prediction is that the more serious parts of upcoming Acolyte episodes will set up those big universe but equally big dark aspects -- we need to see the very early seeds of the megalomaniacal and genocidal aspects of the later galactic Empire. And I think we'll see that emerging in these diverse new characters and their story arcs.",8.0,8 June 2024
Just Ac-alright,"Based on what I have seen on the internet, The Acolyte was a divisive show long before it ever came out. I had the chance to watch the show at an advance screening so I have actually seen it and can leave a fair review. The protagonist (or antagonist?) is Mae, a dark side acolyte hellbent on exacting revenge of four Jedi who ruined her life (as the audience we don't know the exact reason yet.) Her mysterious master has instructed her to kill these Jedi without assistance of a weapon mostly because the director wants to show what a Force-user fight without lightsabers would look like. I imagine this will involve throwing a lot of pocket midichlorians at each other or something like that. The premise is good enough and some of the characters are executed well. Jedi master Sol is acted exceptionally well and I kind of liked Daphne Keen's Theelin padawan character. There were plenty of unique alien designs (some new, some adapted from the animated shows, and some previously seen in live action). The sets also looked great.

Amandla Stenberg plays two roles - Mae (the dark side acolyte) and Osha (her good twin sister. She played the role of Osha just fine (and yes, the Jedi do commit one OSHA violation with her in episode 2), but unfortunately I didn't find her very convincing in the evil twin role. She wasn't intimidating in the slightest but hopefully this gives the character (and actor) a chance to grow.

My main complaint with this show is not the acting though, it is the pacing. We are introduced to 5 or 10 characters but don't really have any moments that show us who these characters are or what motivates them. The writers of these Star Wars shows need to learn to take some time to let the script breathe. We don't need an action scene every three minutes to stay entertained. I would love to see some more talking, character development, and actual world building. The writer of the acolyte didn't get the memo, so we get plenty of action scenes which are at least unique. Thank goodness we got Andor which was miles ahead of the rest of these shows and trusted the audience to pay attention.

Final nitpicky complaint, which won't bother most people reading this is that this show will almost certainly nullify the events of the excellent Darth Plagueis novel written before the Disney acquisition of Lucasfilm. Disney had a perfect script for a prequel to the Phantom Menace and they have thrown that right in the garbage compactor. The jury is still out on this show for me (it could still go either way, I'm giving it a 7 for now) but I can almost guarantee it will not be as beloved to Star Wars fans as the Plagueis novel was.

So go watch the show and decide for yourself. It is neither as horrible as some people are claiming, nor is it as revolutionary as others are saying. But it is an interesting enough story told in a new time period of Star Wars (something we desperately need more of).",7.0,4 June 2024
Just wasn't a good product overall,"I'm writing this for the betterment of the franchise. I've been watching Star Wars my entire life. For the first time in a while, I just feel like a show is using the name ""Star Wars"" to milk a mid show with poor writing, poor acting and bad directing overall. It seems like a fan fiction that a confused teenager made last minute for a high school project that had to be in the Star Wars universe somehow. Holding out hope for the franchise because this just isn't it. Overall the actions and agenda pushing on this show feel so forced (no pun intended) and I just don't know if I have high hopes for the rest of the series. Excited for the future of the franchise tho! They been doing good with mandalorian and BoBF. Need more movies like Rogue One.",1.0,7 June 2024

A Stunning Spectacle with a Story Lost in Space,"The latest sci-fi series, The Acolyte, is a frustrating paradox of technical brilliance and narrative incompetence. From the very first episode, it's clear that the production team spared no expense. The CGI is breathtaking, the sound design is immersive, the music is haunting, and the alien creatures are genuinely intriguing. Unfortunately, all of this is in service of a story that is, quite frankly, baffling.

Halfway through the first episode, I found myself repeatedly asking ""why?"" Why are the characters making these choices? Why are these events unfolding in this way? Why should I care about any of this? I hoped the second episode would provide some answers, but instead, it only deepened the mystery. Now, I'm not only asking ""why"" about the plot, but also ""why"" I'm still watching.

The Acolyte is a textbook example of style over substance. It's a visually stunning spectacle, but without a compelling story at its core, it's ultimately an empty experience. If you're easily impressed by flashy visuals and don't mind a nonsensical plot, then you might find something to enjoy here. But for those seeking a sci-fi series with substance and depth, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.",1.0,5 June 2024

Star Wars Saga,"Star Wars: The Acolyte"" is a gripping addition to the Star Wars saga, exploring the darker side of the Force in an era set before the prequel trilogy. Directed by Leslye Headland, the film delves into the rise of the Sith through the eyes of a young acolyte, played brilliantly by Amandla Stenberg. The movie stands out with its rich, atmospheric visuals and a compelling narrative that balances intense action with deep character development. ""The Acolyte"" offers a fresh perspective on the Star Wars universe, captivating both long-time fans and newcomers with its blend of mystery, intrigue, and dark fantasy elements.",6.0,6 June 2024
Terrible Writing,"I tried to give this show a chance since I have loved Star Wars for decades. This show has terrible writing and dialogue.

Star Wars gets us curious, it's wholesome, it's fun sometimes has on the edge of our seats, but most importantly inspires us to be better versions of ourselves and gives us hope!

The Acolyte is all of these things in a different era. It brings us into a new world filled with color and adventure! New characters, new ideas, but still the same old Star Wars.

Probably made by some stormtroopers ( you know why),"Sadly the period in which the show takes places managed to lure me into watching it and give it a shot so to speak. I have my doubts with every Disney attempt to make something Star Wars related with the only exceptions being Rogue one, Andor and Mando season 1, but every other show or film had something to give it atleast a try and not be totally desatisfied with the experience until now.

The Acolyte is the bottom that Star Wars can be hopefully never to be repeated... The Plot is dull and i would again use the example that it looks like something made by the stormtroopers defeated by the Ewoks. The show has no logic at all, no character depth, no representation of the period in which it is set in.

The actors seem dissapointed as well like playing an AD script, without much emotion or motivation.

The sets looks cheap, espeacially for the bugget put into the show.

The fights are comical as well as the jedi's on Olena and the Yorg one.

Not anymore, I'm done. It's not like they can't make a good Star Wars show that long time fans love and that makes new fans.

Andor is a terrific show. They just seem to not want to. They hate fans like me and it shows.

Delete the show pls,"""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" is a major letdown. The production quality feels cheap, with subpar special effects and uninspired set designs that fail to capture the grandeur of the Star Wars universe. The storyline is lackluster and poorly developed, lacking the depth and excitement that fans expect. Character development is weak, making it hard to invest in their journeys. The dialogue is often cringeworthy, contributing to the overall feeling of a rushed, low-budget project. Even the performances seem uninspired, as if the actors themselves are unengaged.

The acting across the board is terrible with the only decent line delivery coming from the 'Squid Games' guy who by all accounts doesn't really speak English (he's the most solid part of the show and I enjoyed his character), the rest are reading off prompts dotted around set, and they appear to struggle, The fight scenes, especially (and most disappointingly with Carrie Ann Moss) are weird and distracting where they've obviously been sped up to hide the inability of the performers.

So I didn't have any expectations before watching Acolyte and I'm liking it (prison ship scene was stupid though). The characters are okay, Sol is my favourite. Fighting scenes are well done, I clearly can feel some chinese/japanese vibes there. The plot is engaging, looking forward to learn about what's happened on Brendok. So all in all everything looks good so far. I'm still very skeptical and waiting for Disney to screw things up in the next episodes but for now it's a solid 6/10 from me.",6.0,7 June 2024
Absolute rubbish!,"Star Wars written and directed by people who do not understand or appreciate Star Wars. If you want to make this type of series that focuses more on inclusivity than storyline then start a new franchise however be prepared it will still be rubbish and no one will want to watch it.

The storyline feels weak and disjointed, the characters are not memorable and you are left not caring if they succeed or fail.

The premise had so much promise and the idea of a pre series charting the rise of the Jedi and the Dark side I has a great deal of promise. Unfortunately the writing of this series does not draw on that potential and leaves the viewer contemplating how much more to watch before turning over the channel.

The Acolyte is an abysmal TV show that manages once again to dilute the Star Wars world into a pathetic bore.

We thought after Andor, Disney understood which direction to go and how to do it. But no. Here we have a bunch of bad actors with ridiculous haircuts badly dressed reciting the worst dialogues in Star Wars history. Never Jedi powers felt so fake and dumb, just actors pointing their hands. It has no art, no creativity, filmed like daytime TV. The designs seem AI generated as they look Star Wars but feel generic and flat. I still don't understand where the budget went but here are some ideas they could have used : acting classes, real locations, decent wigs, a screenwriter or two, or maybe just give it all to charity.

The series truly disrupts the force, and not in a good way. I don't understand what Disney is thinking and how they can continue from this series onwards.

There's lots of use of The Force, great fight choreography, and the production level is good. It's really interesting what we've seen so far of the Jedi as an established institution. They seem commonplace in this world; some of them seem like local superheroes and others seem like cops, and not in a good way.

Obviously, some people won't like the vibe and have some legitimate complaints, and that's fine, but the pile of one star reviews are insane.

"Disappointing Start: ""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" Misses the Mark in First Three Episodes","Review of the First Three Episodes of Star Wars: The Acolyte

The anticipation surrounding ""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" was palpable, with fans eager for a fresh perspective within the beloved galaxy far, far away. Unfortunately, the first three episodes fail to deliver the compelling narrative and rich storytelling that Star Wars aficionados have come to expect.

From the onset, it's apparent that ""The Acolyte"" struggles to find its footing. The series diverges significantly from the core elements that make Star Wars captivating. The plot lacks the depth and substance needed to draw viewers into this new corner of the universe. The characters are underdeveloped, and their motivations feel contrived, resulting in a disconnect that makes it hard to care about their journeys.

What's particularly frustrating is the missed opportunity. The Star Wars expanded universe is brimming with phenomenal content that could have been adapted into riveting storylines. The Bane Trilogy, Darth Revan, Darth Plagueis, and a young Palpatine are just a few examples of narratives that are rich with intrigue, complexity, and the dark allure of the Sith. These stories not only have a dedicated fan base but also offer a wealth of material that could have translated into compelling television.

Instead, ""The Acolyte"" opts for a storyline that feels directionless and uninspired. The writing lacks the gravitas and intricate plotting that hallmark the best Star Wars tales. There is a noticeable absence of the epic, sweeping feel that fans crave, replaced by a series of disjointed events that fail to coalesce into a cohesive narrative.

Moreover, the show does not capture the essence of the Star Wars universe. The mystical and philosophical underpinnings of the Force, the timeless struggle between the light and dark sides, and the rich lore that defines the galaxy seem lost in this rendition. It feels as though the showrunners have overlooked what makes Star Wars resonate so deeply with its audience.

In conclusion, ""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" is a disappointing addition to the franchise. It squanders the potential of its setting and characters, offering a story that is both poorly written and lacking in substance. With an expansive library of exceptional source material at their disposal, it's disheartening to see such a missed opportunity. Fans of the saga deserve better, and one can only hope that future episodes or series will return to the high standards of storytelling that have made Star Wars a cultural phenomenon.",1.0,12 June 2024

There is a respect for Star Wars lore here and an understanding of the history of the Jedi. We're talking 100 years before phantom menace, we have no idea with regards to how Jedi were perceived at this time. The literature I have read speaks of an arrogance amongst Jedi which is certainly present. There are moments of convenience and a certain bit of rushing to tell the story however it's two episodes in and this can certainly make way for more pacing in the remaining season!

Some franchises, including Star Wars have lost a little way at times; Mando S3, Book of Boba, Ahsoka but there has always been something to mine from them and they do need to be stronger in terms of character development and story.

They need to make negative rating - it's that bad !,"WOW- Heart broken - The Star Wars franchise, once a beloved and iconic series including animation and movies has unfortunately experienced a decline in quality with this latest installment. I have been left disappointed by the lackluster storytelling and character development, leading to a tarnishing of the franchise's reputation. Despite this, Kathleen Kennedy remains in her position, seemingly unaffected by the negative reception. It's disheartening to see such a beloved universe being dragged down by subpar material.

Another BEAUTIFUL disaster,"I lasted 7 minutes, which is longer than I thought I'd be able to. The first 5-10 minutes are where you're suppose to hook the watcher and all it did for me was push me away. I don't even know where to start with this one because the acting is horrible, cgi is below average, the lightsaber looks like a pool noodle (lightsabers haven't looked good since Revenge of the Sith), and its very poorly choreographed. I'd continue my rant but this is a review, not an essay

I just wish Bog and Kathleen would stop ruining star wars. The last good live action series was the Mandalorian. I sincerely hope that Elon Musk will buy Disney and get rid of everyone currently working in Lucasfilms.",1.0,5 June 2024
This is not StarWars,Disney fails yet again everything George Lucas originally made in this amazing universe is completely disrespected and neglected in the show I was hoping it would capture the high Republic air like from the comics but they went the opposite way The dialogue is terrible not a fan of the casting and I think the story is pretty silly. The fight scenes have been OK but with that big of a budget it's hard not to at least get some CGI right this doesn't feel like Star Wars I grew up loving and watching I was excited for a new installment in the universe but so far these first two episodes have fallen very short It seems the Director and writer has an agenda They are trying to push it's unfortunate Disney continues to aloud it I wish stars could get back to its roots and not have people in position of power that mock and insult the fans to push their own agenda.,1.0,7 June 2024
IT IS EXCELLENT,"First two episodes were awesome! I was sitting on the edge of my seat. Characters are rich and it had the heart of the Star Wars saga in the fresh High Republic era. So excited for something new and new characters! It's been a while since I feel in love with new characters, especially in Star Wars, but I'm already invested. I can't get the first two episodes off my mind and the writing has me eager to see where this series goes. Beautifully shot as well. I am getting weary of a small of group of people thinking Star Wars is just for them. Y'all so spoiled. Keep doing what you do Disney and TAKE MY MONEY! Many of us are loving it!",10.0,8 June 2024

10/10 stars and here's why.

The Acolyte seems to have honestly blended itself from the best parts of all the Star Wars franchise. It's worth watching with an eye for grittier storytelling and a mind-blowing vision of the Universe and the Force that we all love.

Turn ""I have a bad feeling about this"" into a fresh take from the minds at Disney and LucasArts thinking outside the box to entertain and imagine more of the timeline to my beloved Star Wars.",10.0,7 June 2024
The end of Star Wars,"If I was to be totally honest, I wasn't surprised. This is, in just the first two episodes, confusing, boring, and simply not Star Wars. This is where I leave my most beloved universe. Having been part of it since 1977, I'm now confronted with a soft un-brutal depiction of 'maybe Jedi's' where every character seems to have random force powers. Where Sith Lords never exist, because I haven't seen one since Vader. Where I continue to wait for real Star Wars. What I get is a watered down lovely opera of young force wielders, dancing around with no motive or reason. No story, no black and white good vs evil, no sweeping backdrops. No normal story telling that made the universe great.

It was a good run while it lasted.",1.0,6 June 2024
"Poor Acting, Poor Plot, Just Poor",Protagonist is not believable. Poor casting choice. Dialogue was written by 12 year olds. Special Effects were moderately done at best. I would label this series as unwatchable. It is pure trash. I found The Mandolorian and Obi-Wan quite good. Ahsoka was ok but not on par with the others. I have no idea what Disney is trying to do with Star Wars but when you have the ability to do a show about one of the lost vile and sinister groups in cinema history (the dark side) and this is the garbage you come up with? You need a good look in the mirror and people need to start losing jobs. I would give this zero out of ten but it wont let me go that low.,1.0,7 June 2024

Feels like written by a 12yo. Worst starwars,"This is the worst Star Wars I have ever seen. The dialogues feel like I could've written them in fifth class. Let's start with the prison scene. The main character gets into a prison cell because the gets mistaken for her twin. Now you probably remember movies where somebody goes into prison and has to show he's tough to find people that can help them. But here, oh no, she gets in the prison cell, door closes behind her and the guys in the next cell directly ask her if she wants to break out with them. I mean are you serious? They don't know her and she's been in the prison for about 5 seconds screentime!",1.0,13 June 2024

Star Wars has become a JOKE,"I never expected Shakespeare from star wars but omg. I feel like Disney actively hates the people who kept star wars going for decades. This show feels like I was watching the real life version of south parks ""Into the panderverse""... You CAN'T help but notice they sacrificed story for messaging. If you think Disney can't do worse than The Rise of Skywalker (Palpatine) then just wait. This show totally lacks depth and actually turns me off star wars. After Andor and Asoka gave some faith back to me I feel like star wars is dead for good now... How are we supposed to care about the characters in this show when they are unlikeable marry sues? Give us characters with depth, real struggles, in their fantasy world.",2.0,11 June 2024
Loving the depiction of the Jedi,"This is what I've been wanting for a long time- a show where we see the Jedi going about their lives in a time when they were fulfilling their traditional roles.

There is plenty of mystery, but the sense that it is building to something meaningful and not mystery for mystery's sake.

The costumes and action are sublime. It's nice how the lightsabers are generally kept off until crucial moments- makes them seem powerful and worthy of respect.

Performance-wise, the characters of Sol and Yord are particular standouts at this stage.

Overall this is looking nice and I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes in the weeks ahead.",8.0,5 June 2024

"Had potential, but still surprised by poor quality.","The special effects were surprisingly bad for a production like this. It distracted from the many other shortcomings evident in the first couple of episodes. It tends to be schoolyard story drama, perhaps it should have been called Jedi High Blues. Lesley Headland has penned a promising story, but seems to have lost me at hello. It doesn't help that everyone has turned on Disney, but still, Andor was a strong story which had little to do with the original story arcs, and it was faithful enough to win over the loyal fans across the 47 years of established storytelling and lore, not to mention the Mandalorian, and the best Disney era Star Wars movie in Rogue One. No, Headland is not convincing me that she understands what the paying public want, and her vision for the Star Wars universe is flawed at best. So the potential wasted may simply be a case of another writer/director manifesting the Disney vision.",1.0,7 June 2024

The dialogue is a joke, the acting is terrible and the make up and costumes are from a year 6 pantomime. Check Weinsteins secretaries bank, because she skimmed millions off the top of this. The 3 sequels hurt Star Wars, this show stabs it repeatedly in the groin.

Be aware, this show has been review bombed, by 5 Star reviews. Click on some. They have names like Mat G and Sammy K. Their only review is of this, and its a rave review.

Disappointin. Again.,,1.0,7 June 2024
A really good start for a Star Wars mystery!,"The Acolyte ditches the usual lightsaber clashes for a detective story. The main characters tackle a series of crimes, offering a fresh perspective on the Star Wars universe. The pace is fast, and while I feared at some point that the plot would fall into clichés, it hasn't and instead used them to hint at a deeper mystery waiting to be unraveled.

The first two episodes fights sequences are well-done, hinting at more epic battles to come. The cast blends familiar faces with newcomers, all delivering solid performances. The characters themselves feel like natural additions to the Star Wars universe.

Venturing into an unexplored era, The Acolyte unveils new locations, cultures, and characters, which is exactly what you would expect from a galaxy and timeline as vast as Star Wars'.

I have enjoyed these two first episodes, perhaps even better since it was reveiwed badly by « fans » before it even aired. I'm giving The Acolyte an 10 out of 10 instead of the 8 I wanted to give it, to balance the trolls. It's entertaining, the mystery is engaging, and it has a lot of potential. Maybe not a perfect 10 yet, but definitely better than Boba Fett or even Obi-Wan Kenobi in my opinion.",10.0,8 June 2024
Same old s... Seriously?,"It's getting old. Wouldn't call it the worst of the bunch that was released by Disney, but it comes close.

After Disastrous Kenobe, Bobba Fett, third Season of Mandalorian and the three movies, comes this mess. It literally feels like a bad parody, where the actors try to act serious, but fail spectacularly.

This is not my star wars. This is something delusional from ""progressive"" mind that has nothing to do with the originals or even prequels, which in timeline are closer to this. The script is bad and not really Star Wars connected. At this rate, the ""Jedi Cal Kestis"" Saga seems like a modern masterpiece, Prequels seem like a classics and the originals (especially episode 5), seem like an unreachable height.

I didn't like it one bit and really sorry for wasting my time on the first episodes.",2.0,9 June 2024
Great start! 10 out of 10,"I'm loving Acolyte so far! The pacing feels right and engaging, the plot is developing in a really sensible way. Overall, I'm enjoying every bit of this view into the high republic and the characters. Writing, acting, cinematography, and the visual effects are great. For example, seeing an earlier Coruscant was so stunning. The visual effects team is making a strong statement. Side note, I'm definitely hoping we see a young Darth Plagueis. 10 out of 10. The fight choreography is unique to the Star Wars universe and adds some eloquence, if you will, to this era. I think they've set a strong tone for the future episodes.",10.0,8 June 2024
Awful,"The thing with stupid is, once u let it inside your organization, it trickles downards. Stupid people hire people even more stupid than they are.

And I think that's how we've gotten here. I mean... I think (I""m not genius myself)?? Honestly, I didn't think about it very hard. Why should I?

I can find 20 people in any given city block that could write something better than this. This show is so terrible, it's amazing. I can't even fathom the levels of stupidity that gave rise to this.

Star Wars is a beloved franchise, and even I often feel some of the newer content is judged too hashly.

But this is out to lunch. There is such a disconnect between what fans want and... this.. rubbish. I am at a loss as to how this show happened.",1.0,12 June 2024
Watched twice,"Watched twice - just to confirm it sux. Interesting premise, but poorly executed. The first time I watched it I was making dinner and it was not winning out over me sautéing the salmon. Once dinner was complete. I watched it again on the big screen. My first thought was that I have seen fanfiction homemade films over the past two or three years that had better CGI and more engaging dialogue. I find it really strange that they give away the mystery , very early on and the rest of the time you're watching with very little suspense or surprise. Yes I could tear into this is being super girl boss and let's not get started about fire and space parentheses although Star Wars has always had a strange relationship with the laws of physics, And Lucas in his own words calls it science fantasy not science fiction ) After the second viewing, this thought came into my mind... Is this some kind of weird payback to Harvey Weinstein's former assistant? Was it to keep Headland quiet about everything she knows and has seen?

Now that would be an interesting film!",1.0,9 June 2024
Garbage,,1.0,12 June 2024
How can this be?,"I said I wouldn't rate this show until I have watched at least half of the episodes, but episode 3 was so bad that I can't help myself. I struggle with even watching anymore of the show, but at this point I feel like a member of the cast on Mystery Science Theater 3000 that has to watch for the comedy of it. For anyone who liked episodes 1-6 of the movie franchise and hasn't given up on the creators yet...get ready because this is going to depress you. I have tried my best to like what Disney has done, but they are more interested in making political or social statements than they are in making good stories. This is just bad. Honestly, this gives bad a bad name! This series is atrocious!",1.0,12 June 2024
Possibly the worst Star Wars show yet,"Such a disappointment. I won't go into any spoilers, but the acting, script, characters are all abysmal. Clearly the focus wasn't on creating a good show for true sci-fi fans. This is more virtue signaling from the insulated Hollywood glitterati, preaching to us lowly peasants.

Lee Jung-Lae is pretty good as an actor, though he's struggling with his English lines. That's basically it. The lead actress feels off, coming across too young and lacks gravitas. Leslie Headland's wife is terrible as an actor. It's all about who you know, and what your politics are. That's Disney in 2024.

Disney Star Wars is running on fumes, and they finally got their audience they deserves - weird activists on social media and ""journalists"". Those are the only ones who are truly enjoying these shows now. Doubt I'll watch the show to its conclusion.",1.0,11 June 2024
Great classic Star Wars,"What a wonderful surprise - this show is quite good (the first two episodes so far).

I had heard some grumblings and mixed reviews. But this is good Star Wars. Much better than Kenobi, for example, or Ahsoka, which I still liked despite its weaknesses. And much better than almost all of the recent movies, which have been poor Star Wars and plain poor storytelling.

This show Is a fresh take on Star Wars, but nevertheless stays true to ""real"" Star Wars. It's set 100 years before A New Hope. But it's got the classic Star Wars elements I love - heroic and super-competent Jedi, a great villain, new tech and aliens, a mystery to start off with, etc.

As far as one-on-one fight scenes, Marvel's Agents of Shield finally made me lose patience with those - I usually fast forward through them now. But in this show they were so well done and integrated into the story and its stakes that I enjoyed them.",10.0,9 June 2024
Disney ruined star wars again,"Sadly Disney doesn't know what to do with star wars and is making the worst concept and taking away everything that makes star wars special this show is one of the prime examples that they are not listening to what star wars fans want or what the original george lucas stars is and was they need to hire people who actually know stars wars and stop destroying this franchise and stop making it all feminine when it doesn't need to be bring in people who love and know star wars this show had potential but as usual Disney ruined it once again and has destroyed the franchise of star wars, they need to bring on script writers and directors who know what star wars is and who love star wars and can bring star wars to life again this is a huge let down and disappointment in Disney once again.",1.0,12 June 2024
Give it time.,"So firstly yes I was there. 77 queuing at the cinema in the biggest queue cinemas had ever seen so I think I can say I'm a master Jedi.

I think all the negative reviews after just two episodes are coming from young immature Star Wars fans trying to make out they know what Star Wars is.

Mandalorian season one started very similarly and it took maybe four episodes for that the click and when it clicked it clicked big time. Rogue One was OK until you watched it a couple of more times and then it really clicked.

I think we have seen in the first two episodes that Jedi Master Sol is hopefully going to pull off some spectacular Yoda-ish fight moves so think before everyone rushes to suggest this isn't Star Wars they should wait and have patience.

The beauty of expanding the Star Wars universe is that different stories will appeal to different people.",10.0,8 June 2024
No spoilers review,"This is a terrible story, it's a hot mess, I am very sorry for anyone involved on this show, but I do not know how else to describe it, but a dumpster fire.

This doesn't even feel like a Star Wars series. It feels like people who really do not know anything about Star Wars got together to cosplay and putting up a makeshift play and they don't know what's going on half the time.

There was someone in management who thought this was ok. No, we don't need anyone to come in and try to re-invent Star Wars. Again, this is a dumpster fire, plain and simple. I swear that I forced myself to watch the current 2 episodes, but I will not continue. Thank you but no thank you.

This is simply sad and embarrassing to watch.",1.0,7 June 2024
It's just sad...,"... I think that's the final nail in the coffin. No matter how much hope you have each time and try to approach the matter neutrally... it's a slap in the face every time. And they always try to blame the fans. Star Wars fans are the worst blah blah blah. Take a look at the good reviews. These are all people who want to counteract this with a 10-star rating. But they don't go into the story or quality of the series at all. All they do is blame the fans and claim there's review bombing. Just like the film makers of The Acolyte. The whole promo was never really about Star Wars, it was always about the political views of Lesley Headland and KK. You have to be very out of touch with reality to call George Lucas misogynistic and think he has no idea about the Force. I feel so sorry for him in the face of this ungrateful bunch.

The biggest problem with the series itself is really the story (as far as you can tell after 2 episodes). The VFX are great as always, ILM does a great job in every project. Everything else seems kind of cheap considering the huge production budget. As a lifelong, huge Star Wars fan who even got a lot out of TFA, I really lost hope. This is the first Star Wars series I've cancelled and stopped watching. If you believe the leaks, it's only going to get worse with Episode 3. So far they've held back...",1.0,9 June 2024
More of the same,"Extremely bad writing and directing. Everything is CGI, nothing is real.

They have just made things up for their new series. Forget about cannon, you can just make everything to fit in with whatever is trending on social media today.

It's more like a mediocre Star Trek episodes from one of the less popular series. Nothing special, nothing terrible. What bothers me about it is that Star Wars used to be so good. Now it all just turns into a bunch of lousy YA style stories.

Disney should just give up and give the series back to Lucas, or maybe even find someone who has actual artistic talent and loves the franchise. Rian Johnson certainly isn't it, and this new director isn't even as talented as he is.",1.0,5 June 2024

An astonishing new low for Star Wars,"This is, quite literally, one of the worst things I've ever seen. The central mystery is obvious from the get go, the acting is mind numbingly bad, and the fight choreography is so sloppy and poorly shot it makes one wonder if they handed the camera to 6 year old. Character motivations change from one scene to another based on the needs of the plot and still they do some of the dumbest things imaginable. There is a scene that has an escape pod full of prisoners picked up by security forces who know there are also surviving escaped prisoners on the planet below, but they leave, travel millions of miles to a headquarters of sorts and it's there they ask if they should go back to the planet and search for survivors. That's not a joke. Every single thing that happens is a result of luck, coincidence or contrivance. There isn't a single honest, organic plot development in two episodes. It all plays out like it was written by a child. Dreadful.",1.0,9 June 2024
It's solid Star Wars and a throwback to the prequels.,"This is a solid Star Wars story in a style similar to the prequel trilogy with more consistent performances. It's clear that the large skewed distribution of reviews at 1-star are disingenuous reviewers throwing a temper tantrum at finally seeing more representation in the Star Wars universe. If you looked at this objectively and seriously without bias you'll see great fight choreography, world building, and an engaging plot. TLDR: reviewing this at 1-star especially with only a handful of episodes available is ridiculous and unwarranted. Gatekeeping a sci fi fantasy doesn't make any sense. This series actually has me excited to see more Star Wars like Andor.",9.0,12 June 2024
Great story!,"So obviously, nobody HATES Star Wars more than Star Wars fans. Are they ever happy with anything? Not that I have seen. Get real people! I am not a fanatic, just a general fan of good entertainment, and I am enjoying this show very much. The actors are good, the story is entertaining, I have not seen any glaring inconsistencies in plot or lore. People just decided they were going to hate it and, surprise surprise, they hate it. It seems as though they don't want anything else to ever be made in the Star Wars universe because there is no way to meet their expectations of perfection. I am surprised that Disney continues to try.",10.0,9 June 2024
An expensive fanpic,"This series obviously isn't for everyone - actually it feels aimed at a small target audience, and for sure not the core fan group of the Star Wars mythology.

There's a lot of things in this series that feels off, but for me one of the worst parts is the dialogue: it feels thin and sometimes like something a pre-teen fanboy/girl would write. And the same goes for the overall look (Venestra, as an example) - it looks like a fanpic from twenty years ago.

And I'm sad to say most main characters (except maybe master Sol) is plain dull. Yord (with his shirtless scene for no obvious reason) is one of the worst part, together with Venestra (a cosplay gone wrong). And the fighting style? No, for us OT fans this doesn't feel Star Wars at all. Might hardcore PT-fans like it? Maybe, but I doubt it.

The Acolyte is a real swing and a miss.",2.0,7 June 2024
The absolute worst,"This show is barely watchable. The storyline is too predictable, it deviates from George Lucas' original vision for Star Wars too much, and the acting is just atrocious. I had high hopes for the show when it was originally announced, but after watching both of the pilot episodes, I quickly realized that this was going to be nothing short of an utter letdown and embarrassment to the franchise.

I'm not even commenting on all the controversy surrounding some of the themes in the show, or the highly controversial director. The show is just bad. Master Sol is an ok(ish) character. If it hadn't been for him, I would have stopped watching after the first episode.",1.0,7 June 2024

Worst Star Wars Content I've Ever Seen,"I have no idea how this was approved by Disney to even be made. The writing in just the first two episodes is atrocious. I don't understand why writers for a billion-dollar franchise need to hear this, but you need to stop assuming your audience is dumb and can't decipher subtext. Stop expositing information to characters who would already know the information. Stop making your characters imbeciles with no critical thinking skills. Stop making background characters static entities when they're off-screen. Stop explaining every single bit of what is happening in the plot through dialogue, as though the audience doesn't have eyes.

"Give it a watch, maybe don't buy the tshirt, idk","Somewhere out there is a great Star Wars adventure we're all really going to get behind again. This one probably isn't it and that's ok.

I guess the Star Wars fan in me wants to see the ""Terminator"" version of this stuff that George Lucas used to joke about fans wanting. Lucas loved pointing out how this was a children's story and asking why on earth we'd be so uptight about it all???. Right! The guy who had to sign off on every piece of sh:t filmed in the movie scoffed at the idea we'd ever go looking for more than an episode of what Buck Rodger's serialized nonsense did for him when he was 6. But hey, it's cool, strikes and gutters man.

I didn't love every second of Andor, Ahsoka or Obi-wan, but they had flashes of genius in each. The Mando-madness has satiated most of us with the Filoni/Favre combo performing their version of Star Wars-ish Stranger Things type joint. This show may turn insanely great but signs point to no per the magic eight ball.

Here we are at this one and the Jedi, who should be noticeably stronger in general in the force without Sidious-that-somehow-returned oppressing the sh:t out of them, are super soft. Trinity did her bit for 5 minutes, then later ol Yord showed us his chesticles.

You cannot seriously think you know everything about this from TWO episodes! You don't.

It's good, it has lots of potential and I'm excited to see what happens! The actors are brilliant, Sol is a super interesting character and it gives a great look into this time of the Jedi.

Imagine how bad Star Wars could possibly be ... and then square that several times. Keep going. It's even worse than that.,"I usually reserve 1-star reviews for technical issues. This is rated so low because of the IP, and how little effort they could have put into it and still made it palatable. There is absolutely ZERO upside to this show. Yes, it looks like Star Wars, but so did X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter.

I saw Star Wars (when it was JUST called that) back in 1977. My entire childhood, world and universe got exponentially better 3 years later when I was shown an ice planet and my two heroes were still working together to save the galaxy. ... It has been a downhill slide since Boba Fett fell into the Sarlacc pit. The Ewoks were horrible, and EVERYTHING since has been a case of ""hold my beer, I can make it even worse"". It has now gone from the best thing I've ever seen on the silver screen, to the worst thing I have ever downloaded and I want my time and bandwidth back.

Dear Harvey Weinstein's former personal assistant, you have successfully driven the final nail in the coffin of Star Wars.

More star wars shows content was all I asked for a decade ago and surprisingly with Disney's purchase I received so much. If only I knew how much I would regret those thoughts.

Star Wars is being acted, directed, and created by people who either have no desire to satisfy actual Star Wars fans, or just genuinely dislike them. It's clear they either haven't seen any of the original work or any of the extended star wars content.

On a purely entertainment level, the acting is awful, mainly i think because of the 5th graders who wrote the script. The visuals are pretty good, but doesn't make up for the lack of story or character presence. Such a huge disappointment all around.

"Not bad so far but not great,","Went into it with low expectations but enjoying it so far. The characters are ok not attached to the characters yet but I am only 2 episode's in. Disappointed with the early deaths of some Jedi's, Hoping for more Wookiee and maybe some Ewok Jedi's.

I think the show has potential and could build an interesting new Star Wara world and expand on the rich history of done right. Also excited for anything Sith related in the upcoming episodes.

Give it a shot just don't expect to be blown away it has potential but I feel like it is a slow burn with hopefully a big payoff. Just don't compare it to the shows before or you will be disappointed.",8.0,12 June 2024
Pound shop starwars,"Watched one and a bit episodes and gave up indisgusted, its like pound shop starwars stuff meets the school play. Do yourself a favor and do something else. Anything else would be better spent time. Really the Clangers have better dialogue. The sets and costumes must have come from the poundshop. The plot is junior school play quality, it makes no sense, constantly contradicts its self. I've given it a one star rating because theres no option for no stars.

The OG Movies Were Hated Too,"What, truly, is a ""Star Wars fan?"" When ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was released in 1980, it was savaged by indignant ""Star Wars fans."" What was Han doing with Leia?! She was Luke's girlfriend? How could the Millennium Falcon travel between planets without Hyperdrive?! How could they end on with a cliffhanger?! Likewise with ""The Return of the Jedi."" How could teddy bears defeat the Empire?!

Don't get me started on the prequels! Jar Jar, Hayden Christensen, and George Lucas buggered my childhood!

So gentle readers, haters have always existed in Star Wars fandom; your mileage may vary. I, for one, have enjoyed the TWO episodes aired so far.",8.0,8 June 2024
Baffling story and writing,"The production quality is top notch but it is not enough to save the show from a contrived story. If you were unfamiliar with Star Wars, and this is the only thing you had seen of it, the contrived writing would not be immediately apparent, but would become obvious later if reflected upon. The contrived story/writing becomes apparent within 5 minutes of the first episode. The primary writer, who is also director and creator, claims to have been unfamiliar with Star Wars before making this show. True or not, clearly they had done significant research, so the inconsistencies are not out of ignorance, but to pin the story into a particular direction that lacks naturalness.

The poor story is not redeemed by the production quality and The Acolyte fails to meet the primary purpose of the art form - it fails to entertain.

It's a shame because the production behind The Acolyte is top notch and Disney missed the opportunity to have made something great.",3.0,9 June 2024
Sorry not that great,"It really isn't that good. Such a shame because I'm waiting for a new Andor or a new Mandalorian but we get this. Again some director who doesn't understand the lore and universe of star wars, someone who again wants to chance it all, in this case to her hand and wants to put her mark down. Like other reviewers said the script feels AI generated (not good) and characters are not likeable and you just don't care about them + the acting isn't really good either, which doesn't help at all.

Just like all the Marvel's I'm getting tired. Just stop it already! Put star wars back in the closet for a few years and try again when the nostalgia is back because this stuff destroys everything.

And what's with all the strange 9/10 star reviews from guys saying there 50 saw the first star wars in the cinemas and that this is the best series ever?

Watched the first two episodes hoping it would hark back to the glory days or at least some of the charm of Mandalorian. Its does not... Some out there will love it, most will not. It is like Kennedy et al have never seen the Lucas movies or more likely wish to change the dynamic completely to target a different audience demographic.

Odd character choices such as a considerably overweight jedi, which seems in contrast to their mind and body training. It's not overly an issue but takes you out of the story.

Visually it looks fine, not great, just fine.

All in all one of the weakest in a long line of poor outings from the franchise. Andor was great because it wasn't trying to ram real world quandaries into the story. This isn't a representation of our world. It's meant to be an escape but an escape which makes sense and consistent. They need to return to what makes them great.

Hate leads to suffering,"Look, it's foolish to rate a season of TV before it has concluded, but I'll do it anyway in order to counter all these ""real SW fans,"" who seem to never be satisfied with anything. This show isn't perfect, but it's not setting out to be the next entry in the Skywalker saga, and that in itself is commendable. So far, Leslye Headland is bringing her Russian Doll flavor, where what's actually happening is slowly unfolding while we get to know the characters (Sol is the most compelling Jedi in a long time). The fights are cool, the locations are real (looking at you, Mando), and the story is introducing parts of the canon that have never been explored. (Witches refer to the Force as the Thread, and utilize it totally differently.) To those complaining about the stilted dialogue, take a look at the prequels and say it again with a straight face. This is melodrama in a galaxy far, far away, and I'm here for it. A Wookie Jedi? Yes please. A Drew Barrymore surprise death? Bring it on. I hope that Sisney can tune out the haters and keep giving us Star Wars that doesn't keep resurrecting Palpatine, or focus on Anakin or Luke and their part of the timeline. Big yawn. This is new and different enough that it might actually pick up new fans, which is what this franchise desperately needs. It's not perfect, but it doesn't require being a super fan to follow (ahem, Ahsoka) and it's not about a stoic hero transporting a child (Obi-Wan, Mando), and it's not rewriting swaths of established stuff (Boba Fett). It's the most comparable to Andor, if only because it's taking swings that the mainline stuff is afraid to (Skywalker). I'm happy with this corner of the lore. Keep it coming.",9.0,13 June 2024

Rather Disappointing,"Based on the first two episodes, underwhelming. Definitely feels like fan fiction. Carrie-Anne Moss's appearance was a plus. She is the biggest name attached to this series. The second biggest is Daphne Keen whom I loved in her other projects who has proven that she can carry a series, however, she is not the protagonist and is all but a background character. So that's a bummer.

Next, the story, felt a lot like Ahsoka, the Jedi Padawan who was set up for offing a Jedi and then left the order.

And then there is the main villain, who they should've focused more on. I was hoping to see a story about the rise of the Sith - which it may still become - however, the evil presented is weak. I wanted something dark and menacing. This is not.

Wasted potential. Not enjoying any characters really. I don't know who this writer/director is. The real mystery is why they were given an entire Star Wars series.

The Jedi are egotistical reminding each other constantly of their faults.

Makeup lacking believability, I mean they hid a George Lucas cameo in the opera scene in revenge of the sith, and the green lady has pink showing thru. The Zygerrian is well designed, but I think you have her on the wrong team. An oppressive species part of the Jedi order?

No character building, by the end of mando episode 1 we knew more or less who mando was, his reputation, and his target.

"Good story, great production value, wonderful cast","The Star Wars show that I had the least connection to (being set in a new era) going in but after two episodes it is looking like a real contender for favourite Star Wars series yet if it sustains this quality for the whole season.

The main cast are just great across the board. All the characters are likable and stand out in their own way. Easily the best cast SW show so far and particularly enjoying Dafne Keen's delivery and facial expressions. Would not know from his performance that Lee Jung-jae only learned English for this show. The lead, Amanda Stenberg, is fantastic. She brings a real warmth and life to her character.

The sets, costumes, locations are all fantastic. As wonderful a tool as the Volume has been for The Mandalorian the physical locations and sets really benefit this show giving it a physicality and grimy lived in feel. Everyone involved in the production has done an outstanding job.

It's only been two episodes but the story immediately grabs your attention and a has you speculating on who did what and what happened at a particular point in the past. A nicely set up mystery that has me looking forward to seeing where this goes. The dialogue, such a weak point for the films, is actually good.

Star Wars: The Acolyte Falls Short of Its Legacy,"""The Acolyte,"" the latest series in the Star Wars franchise, falls short of expectations.

The show rewrites how the force works and introduces factions as if they are new, conceptually. Which already tells you the people involved in this project have never watched or read previous shows, books and movies alike.

No matter what anyone in love with SW says when they let their hearts speak, these people will always fall back on the male 40y/o white stereotype escape-card whenever they need to take ANY responsibility for the atrocities they make.

So my advice: just stay the hell away from anything related to this show. Negative attention is attention too, and attention is all this show is trying to generate.

And on top of that, this show is booooring. Two episodes in and all we know is someone is pushing a girl to get some revenge for something that someone did sometime in the past for some unknown reason. But hey it looks cool.

Lessons have not been learned but I appreciate Boba Fett, The Mandalorian and Ahsoka were broadcast after this was probably in the can. Just another mess served up by the mouse and KK.

Identity politics and poor writing not unsurprisingly have fuelled this too. I don't have time for any of the characters and performances aren't great but they're not being given decent source material.

Lee was compelling in Squid game, but in this he's obviously being fed his lines phonetically before each take and it shows. Don't get me started on Abercrombie & Fitch Jedi bro and fat useless Jedi.

Everything about the production now feels like its a soon to be revealed extra acre in a themepark. And the live action now feels very cartoonish. What do you expect from the mouse though?

Let Star Wars R.I.P,"This is a horrible abominaion of a show, and completely disrespectful to the legacy of Star wars and all the fans that kept the franchise alive for decades.

Please Disney just let Star War rest in peace, no one wants to watch your dumb take on this beloved universe.

As a long-time Star Wars fan, I approached ""The Acolyte"" with high hopes, especially given its intriguing premise and the promise of exploring new corners of the Star Wars universe. However, my enthusiasm quickly turned into disappointment as the show unfolded.

Lackluster Storytelling: ""The Acolyte"" suffers from a lackluster and often incoherent storyline. The narrative meanders without clear direction, making it difficult to become invested in the characters or their journeys. The pacing is erratic, with some episodes dragging on without any significant plot progression while others rush through important events without giving them the depth they deserve.

Uninspired Characters: The characters in ""The Acolyte"" are forgettable and poorly developed. Despite a potentially rich background, the protagonists lack depth and motivation, making it hard to connect with or care about their fate. The antagonists, while visually striking, are one-dimensional and fail to bring any real sense of menace or complexity to the story.

Visual and Production Issues: While Star Wars is known for its groundbreaking visual effects, ""The Acolyte"" disappoints in this department. The CGI is inconsistent, with some scenes looking polished while others appear surprisingly amateurish. Additionally, the set designs and costumes often feel recycled and uninspired, lacking the creativity and attention to detail that fans expect from the franchise.

Weak Dialogue and Acting: The dialogue in ""The Acolyte"" is often stilted and cliché-ridden, failing to capture the wit and charm that have characterized the best of Star Wars. This is compounded by uneven performances from the cast. While a few actors manage to deliver solid performances despite the weak material, others seem lost, either overacting or delivering lines with a wooden, disengaged demeanor.",1.0,6 June 2024

What has really insulted me is the staff and showrunners fully using gender identity and membership of the community as a sheild against sub-par writing, direction and just tone-deaf promotion. They are actively weaponising this to attack the fan base, which is horrible to say. This show is not bad because there is an NB lead. It's not bad because there are non traditional relationships.

The writing in ""The Acolyte"" is a significant letdown, lacking the depth and character development that made the original Star Wars saga so captivating. The plot feels disjointed, with numerous inconsistencies and lazy storytelling. The characters are one-dimensional and fail to evoke any emotional connection. You can tell they were only selected for diversity. It's evident that the writers did not invest enough effort into understanding the rich lore and complex dynamics that define the Star Wars universe.

However, there is probably is no depth to the characters anyway because of the silly script-writing (PLEASE! The phrase ""use your inside voice"" is to earthly to be used in the Star Wars universe!) The most obvious sign that these writers are actually stupid (sorry!) is when they have a fire burn in the vacuum of space.

Fear leads to anger...,"Star Wars has long held the idea that fear and grief can lead a person, especially a force sensitive one, down a dark, (self)-destructive path, see Anakin/Padme, and this is the main theme of Acolyte.

As someone who's kinda tired of lightsabers and overcoreographed duels I'm glad the show refrains from using them too much. The focus on hand-to-hand and more low key martial arts is refreshing to me.

The show has its share of dumb, clumsily executed moments, a certain fire comes to mind, but the core personal conflict and the drama around it are compelling imo. Light and dark, grief and hope, guilt and attonement, these things are central to SW and it's nice to have a show that focuses on them.

It is more of a low intensity show and if you need lots of action Acolyte might strain your patience. Just something to keep in mind.",8.0,12 June 2024

I have no clue where the money went to be frank, because it didn't go towards hiring any talent as far as acting goes. Maybe they went with lower level actors/actresses to go all out on the production, but if that was the case they failed.

Dramatic dementia and staged stupidity,"I rated the first two episodes, in which we were shown fire in space, neutrally and with restraint, but the third series was released, and in this series the creators pile up so much unpretentious nonsense that reflects the creative decline and propaganda surrealism of binary categories and objectifications, typical biopolitics and identity spectra, which are not something to understand, but to contemplate and listen to is disgusting. The boundaries between good and evil, it turns out, do not exist. The Jedi are not so right, and evil is a necessary counterweight, and it's not even that the Jedi can be wrong, but in the very context of the statement, in which you yourself determine what is right and wrong for you, but even here there are no clear boundaries - everything is allowed, if not forbidden.

Let's remember what Master Yoda said in George Lucas's first film: ""Fear the dark force. Anger, fear, aggression - the dark side of the force is this. They come easily, give support in battle. Once you enter the dark path, it will determine your fate forever, it will consume you..."" But it doesn't matter to the ""mouse top managers"", they have their own licensed universe, protected by purchased authorship, and they are the masters in it, and they do whatever they want.

The third series is just the apogee of dramatic mediocrity. Religion, shamanism, magic, matriarchal society, the threads of the universe - everything is mixed up, everything is upside down - ""what are they carrying"" - I would like to ask them such a question.

Space Amazons who call themselves witches, raise twin girls for some kind of mission, wave their hands with a serious face - conjure, recite spells - what is going on here at all?

The Jedi appear and demand that the girls pass the test. And it's kind of voluntary, but forced - what kind of nonsense is this?

A little twin sister, with an impulsive behavior disorder, is doing some kind of ""game"". Leslie Hadland presents a little sociopathic rebel from her inflamed mind and masks all this nonsense with fantastic decorations, just to justify the development of an absurd conflict. Who came up with all this? What for? For what?

I would like to ask the screenwriters a question: ""Have you been checked by a psychiatrist for a long time? Should you go for a checkup?""

In my first review of this series, I was more supportive, and said: ""But there are fears that the absurdity of actions will gain momentum - this usually happens after episode 2, but let's hope for the best."" My fears have been confirmed, the absurdity is simply off the scale. Now I understand why Kerri-Anne Moss chose a cameo role, and she did the right thing!

And all these plot absurdities of the first two episodes: with fire in space, with frost that does not freeze, with suicide Jedi - this is only the visible part of all this ""gibberish"" that is in the head of the screenwriter.

The series saves not only on special effects, but also on common sense and artistic creativity. I have not seen such scenic mediocrity and staged stupidity for a long time.

In my opinion, this film show should be closed on the third episode, so that it is simple, banal not to disgrace itself in the eyes of the audience and not discredit the studio.",2.0,12 June 2024

First two episodes,First off I would say I'd give it 2.5 but that's not an option and I just don't think it gets 3 stars. The first episode is 1 star for sure it's almost unwatchable. (Bad acting from some. Odd pacing and overall pretty boring) how ever the second episode is better than the first which gives me a slightly hope it might get better with more episodes to come. That being said the second episode I would give 3/3.5 stars. It's watchable and the actor who plays master sol pretty much carry's the episode (there's a lot of bad acting in this however he is excellent) hope the show gets better and I'll adjust my ratings but for now after 2 episodes it gets 2.5 stars.

Fighting was accurate to lore and the story is a good intro to the old republic,"The show has a great plot and well written characters to care about. The fighting is smooth, can't wait to see where it goes. The actors are good and you can read the characters thoughts as they're having them from the facial expressions. The ships and droids are accurate to the time period. The fight choreography uses the environment creatively and different Jedi fighting forms/techniques. There is information about the characters given in how they fight, it conveys their personalities. It's very focused on the Jedi and the dynamics between them and their padawans.

RIP Star Wars,"No words can express how bad this is..This is Pure GARBAGE and I am being polite. I am seriously considering canceling Disney+

Shameful and disgusting to think that in a few short years, Disney has basically destroyed what George Lucas has created.

What happened to just great storytelling? It's as if the writers of this show decided to use Chat GPT to write the show. Where is the creativity? I am all for inclusion, but this is getting ridiculous.

I thought Amandla Stenberg did a fabulous job and I've been a fan of hers for years from Colombiana and hiw they see us. Props too to Dafne Keen from his dark materials and Logan. More favourites of mine. Plus we see the incredible Jodie Smith, I've never see her act before but she's fire and watch a beautiful woman. My old matrix queen is there too.

"Poor Writing, Poor Star Wars World Knowledge, Poor Execution","""The Jedi agree with me,"" says Sol, the Jedi Master, to Yorg, the annoying, stupid, argumentative Jedi Knight (with fabulous hair and 4% body fat) in episode 2. Which Jedi agree with you, Sol? Aren't you the Jedi?

There are many such examples of a lack of attention to detail in the scripts.

This continues the trend since ""The Force Awakens"" of writers and actors who lack the depth and understanding to portray a Force user. Notable exceptions are Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. As actors, they could have pulled it off, but both failed due to shallow and disjointed writing of their characters.

There are a couple of cool ideas for the world-building and plot here. Those are totally subverted by terrible writing and bad casting decisions that seem to have been motivated by... ahem... other factors... than talent and proper fit for the role.

Writers were never fans,"It's clear. For the people involved in this project it's just a that. A job. They were never fans. They may have heard of Star Wars growing up and they probably never gave heed to it.

Why doesn't Disney get this? 90% of Star Wars fans are grown men. Why do they want to please an audience that will never come?

You are taking assets that were dear a particular type of audience and ruining it for all. It's like forcing boys to buy Barbie dolls. They just don't want it.

Basic product research involves an ideal customer profile (ICP) research. I believe Disney meetings are like, ""Okay, so these are the people who love this product. Let's forget about them and figure out how we can package it to people who've never given a damn about it.""",1.0,9 June 2024
A Dismal Chapter: The Decline of Star Wars Continue,"This series undoubtedly represents the lowest point in the vast Star Wars universe, making 'Kenobi' seem like a masterpiece in comparison.

The opportunity to create a groundbreaking series was within reach, especially considering the years of anticipation for a narrative set in the High Republic. However, the final result is not only disappointing but also a blatant waste of talent. Carrie-Anne Moss's involvement is a prime example: an actress of her caliber, with undeniable charisma, is relegated to a role so brief that her presence fails to develop (barely five minutes on screen).

The pacing of the series is painfully slow, and the conversations lack dynamism. Except for the notable performance of Lee Jung-jae, the cast appears soulless, dull, and predictable. At various points, the quality of the special effects is subpar, raising serious questions about the allocation of the considerable budget for this production.

It is profoundly sad to witness the continuous decline of Star Wars. The essence of the saga has long since faded, becoming a shadow of what it once was. This series not only fails to capture the magic of the original universe but also insults the legacy of a saga that has marked entire generations.",1.0,8 June 2024

I keep watching the new shows because I love Star Wars, and I keep hoping for another Rogue One or Andor. Which were both made by the same person, someone who can actually write a good story. Since these two stories tie directly to the original two trilogies, they should just uncanonize everything else and start over with real writers.

This show is like a bad version of Motherland: Fort Salem set in space. I loved Motherland: Fort Salem! It wasn't the best show ever, but it had a good well written story, which The Acolyte does not have in any way shape or form.

From stoic, robed Jedi Knights and their Padawans of all strange alien races to comically inefficient police droids and deft battles of Force and precognition, The Acolyte brings a campy while intriguing and visually unique experience evocative of the prequels with inspired designs, at times unintentional humor, and a glimpse into the age when Jedi rule was absolute and wrought with corruption.

I'm sorry that all of you complaining about this show didn't get spoon fed the same inane Skywalker dribble you crave so ravenously. I'm sorry this show is giving you new ideas and characters and not just regenerating the same tired old characters and plots down your throats. This show is pretty good so far.

I particularly liked Carrie Ann Moss, even though her portion is a Matrix ripoff, Trinity is a very Jedi like character and could have been cut and pasted in effective into a better plot.

Cons: there's no story here. This reeks of another project that was greenlit on a premise without a finished script or even creative inspiration. Back of the DVD summery level plots are all you get. Characters are dull and redundant. The actors deserved a better script than this.

The dialogue sounds like it's been written by a 5 year old, the sets look fake and the characters have no personality.

I've already found myself invested in several characters and the storyline overall - which has me thinking about the show long after watching the premiere. To me, that's the mark of well done writing and a properly thought out plot.

Star Wars and story quality is dead!,"I had not completely given up hope on the Star Wars franchise, even after the recent disasters of Disney's movies and series. But now, after this ridiculous series, it's finally over for me! I am no longer willing to waste my time on this nonsense produced by completely untalented writers and directors. They will never understand why Star Wars became such a phenomenon in the late '70s and why the original films had a certain magic. That magic has been absent for a long time now, as today's ""cinema"" seems to consist of poorly copying once-successful directors without understanding why their films worked so well!

You can see it across all media these days: the quality of productions and, most importantly, their content has drastically declined. Are there no creative minds left who know how to captivate an audience? What's going on? There was a time when you could browse through streaming services and find a movie or series to enjoy... now, you fall asleep just clicking around, as there's nothing worth investing your time in anymore.

I've finally decided to stop watching new content and instead, I read old books (since new ones are often just as bad as TV series) and exclusively watch old movies, mostly from the '70s and '80s. If things don't improve in Hollywood, at Disney, and elsewhere, then I'm done for good! Let them watch their drivel and fan fiction and pat themselves on the back.

In retrospect, Carrie-Ann Moss is probably glad she only got a few lines in the series.

Anakins ""I don't like sand"" monologue from Episode II feels Shakespearean compared to this mess.

Yord is annoying and jumps to conclusions too fast, but that's the only somewhat bad character (at least my opinion.)

I'm not mad that every character isn't a white guy, but story and character development beyond the gender or color of skin is FAR more important when telling a story. Personally, Ahsoka is my favorite Star Wars character. Not because she was a woman and was later played by an afro-latina actress, but because Dave Filoni and George Lucas, when he was a part if it, created an incredible arc for her in the Clone Wars that made me love her forever.",1.0,6 June 2024
Doesn't feel like it was made with much passion,"So far the show feels like the quality a fan-made film but without any of the passion that would go into that.

The characters are pretty bland, there's nobody you really become invested in. The storyline is fine but nothing new enough to really captivate me. Maybe it will develop more as the show goes on.

The other strange thing is, despite having close to a movie budget per episode, the effects look terrible. The humanoid aliens all look like cosplays rather than real creatures/people and the CGI is pretty rough. I have no idea what they spent their money on because it doesn't feel big-budget at all.

The setting and the premise could have work with more effort put into it, better writing and better edit but it's simply not there. It looks like a rough draft of scenes that hasn't been worked through properly. Maybe older series and movies where made by people who knew the amount of effort required to make something good, made it's something plaguing the writers generation. Writers and directors are picked for what they stands for rather than what they actually bring to the table when it comes to making a good show. Making a good show requires dedication.

And in general, I may be writing a bold idea now - it's high time Mr. Lucas retired, and his ideas, which were once impulses, need to be adapted and developed with the times.

Milking the franchise ... and doing it badly.,"With so many spin-offs from the Star Wars franchise, some are hits and MANY are misses.

After watching the first two episodes, I cannot differentiate if I'm watching something from a long time ago in a galaxy far away or a facsimile of the art of Shaolin discipline. While both have similarities in concept, the basic philosophies of practice remain quite different. Attempting to merge these two is a disastrous consequence and nothing more than a fusion of futility aimed at nothing more than trying to make a quick buck and defamation of the Jedi existence.",2.0,9 June 2024
Star Wars kung-fu theater is all I ever wanted,"Intriguing look into another era in the Star Wars universe, expanding on lore found in series literature while also delving into some unexplored territory. Love the martial arts tropes, costume and production design, and Lee Jung-jae's Jedi Master Sol. While I'm a generation or so outside of the show's target audience, I think it's great to have viewing options for the teenage and young adult fans of the franchise while appealing to those who grew up with the prequels and animated series. Can't wait for the rest of the season, and look forward to Lucasfilm taking more chances like this in the future.",10.0,7 June 2024
"""When the Force Falters: Why Fan Films Are Outshining Disney's Star Wars""","Disney's latest Star Wars offering, ""The Acolyte,"" feels like a predictable story with a focus more on American politics than on the magical universe George Lucas created. The series seems to struggle with balancing its narrative, leaning heavily into contemporary issues rather than exploring the rich lore and imaginative storytelling that originally captivated fans.

Ironically, a fan film titled ""The Acolyte,"" released three years ago, demonstrates a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Star Wars universe despite its low-budget production. This fan-made project captures the essence of what Star Wars should be-immersive, character-driven, and steeped in the mystical elements that made the franchise iconic.

Kathleen Kennedy's empire may have the resources, but it often misses the mark on delivering the soul of Star Wars. Meanwhile, dedicated fans, armed with passion and creativity, manage to outshine the big-budget productions. These fan films, crafted with love and respect for the source material, remind us of the true spirit of Star Wars that seems to be fading in Disney's hands.",1.0,8 June 2024
It's fantastic if you just mute it and close your eyes!,"I've always been a fan of poor acting, a bland story, and bad dialog so it's surprising I didn't like this series.

The art of storytelling has been lost. Maybe they should use the force to try and find that instead.

I don't have enough digits on both hands and feet to count the compelling characters and stories that Apple has come out with.

Good thing I don't need any left over for anything Star Wars...

Tragically, I don't need any for Star Wars...

But I did order some OG Star Wars extended universe novels a few days ago. Finally I can be excited for some quality Star Wars stories!

But in all fairness I like pretty lightsabers too much so I had to bump it up from 1 star to 2.",2.0,8 June 2024

Another Happy Landing,"The Acolyte starts as strong as only a modern era Star Wars can. Dead pan line reading opens into a fight scene, which while looking cool, feels off in the Star Wars franchise and it is almost as if it used to be part of another. The plot then unfolds into a compelling murder mystery that reveals who the killer is and who isn't in the first 10 minutes. Holmes and Poirot better take notes!

After that the show puts science back into science fiction with a rare treat of some fire in outer space. This masterpiece scene is followed by some more line reading, exposition dumps and a plethora of contradicting lines and statements. As expected the pace considerably slows down from the opening minutes.

All in all the pilot (twin) episode of The Acolyte barely takes off before crashing head on into the ground but it is fine. Everyone's mediocre fanfiction gets a 180 million show, everyone's wife gets hired and the fans as per tradition were branded as bigots before the show even aired.

Another happy landing for Disney Star Wars.",3.0,7 June 2024
Best Jedi backstory in 2024!,"I've waited since I was a little kid for a Star Wars Jedi backstory. Now it's finally here . It's all making sense of how the Jedi used to be the gaurdians of peace before order 66 , the dark times and before the empire started and before Anikan skywalker was born. OSHA is by far not so bad . But her twin sister is a bigger threat to the Jedi . The twin is being trained by the Sith Lord . Who ever this Sith Lord is i hope to find out who it is . I'm hoping it's darth plagues the wise or someone far more powerful than sidious Vader and kylo ren . I hope in the next episodes I see more of Corasuant and tatooni . And the beginning of the Droid army .",10.0,10 June 2024
Another disappointment,"I was hoping I would like this. I used to be a big Star Wars fan. I loved games like KOTOR or SWG so was happy to see a different era shown from disney.

I turned this off in 2 minutes, even my wife thought it was awful. The opening dialogue and acting was so bad and cringe it felt like I was watching a YouTube fan film.

They need better/more experienced actors for this kind of content. Star Wars is supposed to be a AAA brand so why do they bother to bring out the C tier squad for these shows. Proper actors, with proper direction could make a big difference here.

Unfortunately they aren't to blame, ultimately the fault is Disneys top level leadership. They have and will continue to drive the brand into the ground and when it's dead instead of accepting responsibility they will blame the ""toxic fanbase"".",3.0,7 June 2024
Thrilling and fascinating,"The Acolyte is truly making a difference. It has brought everything Star Wars needs. The Mandalorian is full of excitement while Andor has an incredible realistic view. In my opinion,The Acolyte has done both. Former Star Wars series mainly show a better side of the Galaxy,and The Acolyte,however,starts with a murder,which leads to more and more puzzles. It's a new way of storytelling that no one has ever done before. In short,the two episodes are absolutely amazing. Can't wait to watch the next episode. Last,sincerely hope that some fans could focus on the storyline instead of what color the actors are:(",10.0,7 June 2024
Not a good series,"All the characters have less charisma than a stormtrooper. That's how bad it is. You're better off with just watching The Mandalorian again and again. It's either the fault of the casting team or the screenplay writers. It's just not engaging enough. I got bored after watching 10 minutes of the first episode and had to force myself to finish it. Now I'm not sure I want to start watching the second episode.

To watch all these actors playing as jedi characters without any charisma is truly painful. The jedis were less charismatic and less engaging than Jar Jar Binks. Don't waste your time with this one.",2.0,7 June 2024
Shortcomings are far too many,"There are times when you see shows/movies that you might not necessarily plan on seeing and they just pull you in. They draw you in from great acting, cinematography, or a superb story line. Well this sadly and definitely is not one of those times. The characters are lackluster and the story is drawn out already The actors are like trick-or-treators and the costumes are cute, but simply not believable and they do not pull you in.

Part ways through you find yourself simply not caring for the development and hoping the characters would get replaced. Star Wars used to have such emotions and great progression with character nuances and great metamorphosis. Now they are bland and just there occupying space without any true fire and emotion.

This makes me want to go back and watch and appreciate the older movies and Star Wars even more now. This is what happens when politics come into play, you lose sight of the forest from the trees and end up not caring about the trees nor the forest/",1.0,8 June 2024
Corrupted and twisted,"As many shows now days it managed to corrupt the source material or in this case. Fails to add story to the same world as it. The twisting and turning to make it fit ""modern audiences"" and self insert of ideas and politics.

The changes to the world aren't really what's bad about it, The scripts just bad. The more you change a world/story the better writer you need to be, Bad script writers cant adapt and change things because they fundamentally don't understand storytelling. And on top of that these writer don't seem to understand star wars at all and it just ends up disrespectful.

The people that paid for this must hate star war or love to waste money.

If we just look at the script for a pure storytelling and not as a star wars scrip. It appalling don't think it will make new people love star war and old fan will probably just leave at this point.

To generalize the actors are below average. And the few that can act cant magically make the lines into good writing.

Lack of understanding of special effects and cgi.

There are a lot of places where cgi are just added when it didn't really needed to be there and since its bad it just end up pulling you out.",2.0,12 June 2024
Wow this is a new low,"How on earth did this get put out, do Disney not have viewing forums anymore? As it stands in my mind this could be the biggest load of drivel that Disney have put out right along with Snow White.

I always watch everything with an open mind and know that all things cannot stand still in time. Successful franchise stories either have to either move forward or backwards in time for content. After three episodes I cannot see where this goes, you cannot blame the actors for dire storylines and script. Where Disney goes from here is anyone's guess, but unless they get a grip they will certainly be having more loses. Hopefully I can come back and update my review but it's not looking good at this moment in time. It will take a massive change in direction but by the look so far that will not happen unless new script writers took over, which is doubtful.",2.0,12 June 2024
A Huge Let-Down,"After exciting, original, and worthwhile series like the Mandalorian, Book of Boba Fett, and Ahsoka, I had high-hopes for this series. The first episode felt like it had some promise, with an average fight-scene near the beginning, but the show struggled to engage.

The characters where for the most part not memorable at all, and there felt as though there was very little chemistry between them. Lots of the interactions came across as forced, and a lot of the lines were delivered quite poorly.

In terms of the story, it doesn't feel part of anything significant, unlike the Mandalorian, for example. It is just a bit underwhelming and doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the Star Wars series.",2.0,8 June 2024
Great show!,"This is a great show so far and only 2 episodes are out.

A lot of people are saying it's not Star Wars and that's because it's set in a completely new era of that universe and it's been amazing seeing it all come to life, with the characters, costumes, planets.

Anyone who has read the high republic era of books and comics you will feel right at home watching that era finally appear in live action with some characters making an appearance.

Other reviews are just sad little boys upset that they don't have Luke Skywalker.

Again great show so far, can't wait for the rest of the season to come out.",10.0,8 June 2024
I'm loving it so far!,"I'm only 2 episodes in and am really enjoying it. All the performances are excellent and the universe is well established. The costumes are beautiful, as always as are most of the actors. I'm looking forward to more episodes! It's interesting to see the early days of the Jedi. There is an adorable droid your kids will want to own as soon as it comes out in stores. The sound track is spot on as only John Williams can be in any Star Wars saga and the lead actress actually plays her father's violin in the orchestra. Talk about talent! Suspend your disbelief and dip your toes into this excellent series.",10.0,10 June 2024
Star Wars is a Zombie Franchise,"In the short, sad history of Disney Star Wars, this is arguably the worst thing they've put out. It makes 'The Last Jedi' seem almost reverent to the franchise by comparison.

Great production values are constantly undermined by the inane scripting, bad dialogue, wooden acting, and boringly predicable plot 'revelations'. It feels like a $200 mil high school stage play, conceived by the angstiest group of Emo-kid lunch table rejects who are determined to destroy all the other kids' toys just for the 'LOLs'.

I've you've ever had any affinity for Star Wars as created by George Lucas, then I urge you to not watch this waste of a brilliant IP. It is genuinely franchise destroying on par with 'Terminator: Dark Fate', 'Dr Who: The Timeless Children' or 'Highlander: The Source' in that it fundamentally fails to understand what made the series popular in the first place. Which is to say nothing about the genuine disregard for established canon and world building.

It's the kind of bad that I'm not mad anymore, or even disappointed, because that would have required me to still care. If this is the future of Star Wars then I'm done, I am no longer interested what they are trying to sell me. They are welcome to the mystical 'modern audience' they are so desperate to cater to.

Borders on unwatchable, even in the name of mockery, avoid.

Worst Star Wars Ever,"This is such a terrible series. Can't believe it was green-lit for production. Bad dialog, disrespect of prior Star Wars lore, wooden acting, and just generally a poorly written script and bad series concept.

It is also bad for what it lacks -- the Star Wars video games leaned into what fans really want: lots of Jedi lightsaber duels, action, and heroism. By contrast, The Acolyte is a dark, broody, dull, lifeless, amateurish soap opera.

Another issue is that they seem to paint the Jedi order as the 'bad guys'. Another attack on the original notion of there being good and evil sides of the force, and the Jedi being on the good side, and Sith on the evil.

I liked Andor and the Mandalorian but this has taken the franchise in such a horrible direction that I think I'm going to give up on all the Disney Star Wars and just re-watch the original movie trilogy from time to time, and maybe read the older Marvel comics and EU novels.",1.0,13 June 2024

How did it get this bad?,"I give it 1 star because at least the costumes look ok in some scenes, but as for the rest, it's just a trash heap of a series.

End to end nonsensical story building, instant travel, and idiotic plot points. Jedi are (once again) being watered down in order to carry a 'Jedi BAD' narrative. The problem with that narrative is that it makes no sense and does not fit in the existing story line.

Fight choreography is slow and hilariously bad on top of it: Slow, telegraphed fights that seem minted out of early 2000's bad TV. Seriously, there are better fight scenes in old Kevin Sorbo camp shows than this one.

The entire universe's logic has been thrown onto its head for the sole reason of pushing impossibly boring characters. Even in the first episode, the series instantly suffers from Game of Thrones-style season 6-8 'impossibly instant travel' syndrome mixed with a side-infection of 'terribly bad character logic'.

Even if you turn your brain off and try to enjoy the views and CGI, it's just stale and boring.",1.0,6 June 2024
This is by far the best Star Wars product we had in twenty years,"Let's face it we all love Star Wars but the quality is inconsistent at best. The Mandalorian was fun but it got old a bit fast . The Book of Bobba Fett was a failure and the Obi Wan show was a hit and a miss . Yes it was good to see him back and the duel with Vader was awesome , as well the young actress who played Leia but everything else was kind of mediocre at best . And then we had Andor

Andor is a master piece . There is no other way to describe it . Everything from the script to the acting to the production value to the directing ... it was pure professionalism and just brilliant . There was just one thing missing . Jedi ! Yes as much I loved Andor I wanted my Jedi. And like an evil genie Filoni gave us the Jedi with Ashoka and good for this was so bad . You can tell that Filoni is an amateur . The show was just mediocre and was entirely about the poorly made animated series called Rebels . Everything from the plot to the characters was just sub par . Like I love Rosario Dawson but it was easy to tell that she didn't put much effort in the choreography and neither did anyone else . It was a show relying entirely on hype and built in audience and it pandered to them so she's it forgot to deliver an actual quality product

And then we have The Acolyte . After Andor this is the only other show I would describe as a masterpiece . Every part of it is amazing . The fight scenes are top notch , the choreography and the actors are amazing . You can feel the sheer amazing skill of the Jedi in a way we haven't seen since that Darth Mail fight . The production value of the show is great and you can tell that real professionals are working on it . The story is intriguing and doesn't require you to have watched random cartoons before , the characters are engaging snd very well written .

Honestly I have absolutely zero complaints . Everything about this show is absolutely delightful . It feels like the Star Wars we always dreamed off . Highly recommend if.",10.0,5 June 2024
2024 earth problems in a fantasy galaxy,"The creativity in ""Star Wars: Acolyte"" is off the charts. However, let's take a moment to discuss some of the choices made in the series. Pronouns? Check. Two mothers? Yes, indeed! While diversity and representation are important, we must ask ourselves: are these elements truly necessary to the core of the Star Wars galaxy?

It's becoming increasingly evident that storytelling, as an art form, seems to be getting lost in the shuffle. Instead of focusing on compelling narratives and character development, what we often see these days are forced narratives that prioritize inclusion over substance.

Maybe it's time to review what's what. It's crucial to balance creative freedom with the essence of what makes the Star Wars universe beloved by so many. After all, the magic of storytelling lies in its ability to resonate universally, beyond any specific agenda.",1.0,7 June 2024
A Star Wars mystery in the making,"I really enjoyed the first two episodes. Introducing all new characters from a time before ""Skywalkers"" is a refreshing direction for the franchise and I hope we get more new and interesting stories like what I've seen so far in The Acolyte; stories that are no doubt Star Wars (visually and thematically), but break out of the shadow of the Skywalker Saga and all of its established characters. With that being said I am a huge fan of the OT and love, like, and at least claim all of the Skywalker saga (yes even 8 and 9). And as much of a Luke fanboy as I admittedly am, it's time for that story to be finished. It's time for more Star Wars like The Acolyte.",9.0,6 June 2024
Disappointed,"After watching the excellent Andor (possibly the only decent Star Wars material that Disney ever released after acquiring the franchise rights).

Acolyte was lacklustre. Characters and world absolutely uninspiring and story so far didn't show much promise. Which sadly confirmed that Disney once again completely ignored fans, story and quality in general only to focus solely on promoting their political agendas.

Honestly I cannot understand why art needs to always fall victim of greed and politics.

Let's hope that it improves and future episodes are a bit more enjoyable and compelling. Although, I really doubt that.",4.0,5 June 2024
Why,"Ever since Disney took over the SW franchise has gone from OK to terrible.

This is one of the worst shows I have seen in a long time. I gave up after the first episode and I wanted it so mich for this to be something fun. I would have been glad if it had been just Ok.

As a long time sw fan this show is gut wrenching and painful.

Please stop.

The acting is bad, story and writing not understandable. The CGI however is pretty good.

One my favorite Matrix actors was pretty good.

Mabey this is just me missing the nostalgic feeling of seeing star wars as a kid and possibly the mass production of shows has filled my stomach.

is still star wars ?,"First, show looks okay; fx are decent and design is ok.

But besides that, there's not much else. Characters are blank, acting is bad, plot is uninteresting so far.

It's like we're in a star wars multiverse where everything that made star wars is slowly disappearing replaced by things created by people who don't have a clue about the star wars lore.

It's a trend lately with star wars shows (but andor and the first two season of mando)

Well as you must never say never, I guess I'll continue at least till the fourth episode like the critics were able to do to finalize my judgement but so far the start is less than ideal.

At 45 I've been a fan of Star Wars my whole life, and this just ends it for me. Why is it so hard to write a good star wars script with what the fans want?

I haven't seen episode 3 yet, and don't want to tbh, apparently that has some canon breaking scenes. As far as i'm concerned, this is not star wars, it is not lore and it is not Canon. Fingers crossed it gets cancelled asap.",1.0,4 June 2024

The characters are all interesting. I cannot even believe people are saying the acting is bad. Shows they don't even watch the show. The only valid complaint I've seen is that is feels like fan fiction on a very high budget. That carries weight, but only because we are only 2 episodes in. Once we get to the meat of this story I truly believe this show will shed that diss. But we will see. Even if it doesn't get rid of that, I can only say that I cannot wait for the next episode.",9.0,6 June 2024
Muppets in Space,"I watched the first 1,5 epsiodes. After that I couldn't continue.

It was really, really bad. The set and costumes looked like something out of a muppet movie or ""The Dark Crystal"". Which would be fine by itself, but not what I want from Star Wars. I could see how the actors were amateurish copied together digitally in some scenes, with inconsistent lighting.

But the worst were the terrible dialogs, terrible acting, terrible story. And on top of that terrible pacing. It couldn't hold my interest.

This will be the first live action Star Wars which I won't continue watching.

Too bad, because the underlying idea could have made a great series.",2.0,9 June 2024
"Maybe not the worst Star Wars' series, but right down there","Watched the first episode and was not impressed by the acting at all. Of course, we expect a ""girl power"" theme, but it's taken to the extreme right off the bat as our villain quickly dispatches all the males in the cantina, leaving only a female ""Jedi"" to put up a fight. They have a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon duel that ends badly for more of them when the other makes her fall for the oldest distraction trick in the book.

Action sequences aren't awful, but that's hardly high praise. Not until at least halfway through do we meet a straight, white, male character, and he's a baddie in prison. It's all girls and/or people/aliens of color through out, none of whom are particularly memorable.

The plot is okay, would-be hero wrongly accused, but the execution is not interesting, the characters dull, and the dialogue woodenly written and delivered. Will not be continuing the journey with them.",3.0,6 June 2024

If on the other hand you are a fan of Star Wars, and have knowledge of the lore and continuity, then this will be even more of an ordeal for you. Not only do the above mentioned apply, but in addition you get to see the franchise you once loved to get disrespected and humiliated.

Honestly, as far as Star Wars goes, if Dave Filoni isn't personally handling the creative side of it I'm not even going to try and watch it anymore. This show is a culmination of all of Kathleen Kennedy's failures and it is by far the most objectively terrible thing I've seen as far as Star Wars goes.

So stuck in the past, that they can't move forward to the future. Allowing a new succession of characters to carry the Jedi into the future. So what if a woman takes the lead, men act like they're the only creature in the world.

"Cheap Knock-off, This Is Not Star Wars..,.","The first episode just stinks. Bad acting, crappy CGI, weak plot, and the sets and lighting don't look right, it doesn't look believable. After hearing about this series for several years I thought for sure that Disney would hit a home run with it. They've had years to get a good script put together and to rework the plot to turn out a good product. Well, that's not this show and instead, the first two episodes feel like a Star Wars knock-off. The opening fight scene used more of a slow motion Kung-fu fight style where the actors gracefully slide and take strange leaps all over that seem too exaggerated for a Jedi at times. That's just not Star Wars. All the Jedi dress the same and they act more like weird monks, so how did that turn into the Star Wars that we know 100 years later. Disney spent a lot of money to buy the rights to Star Wars and Lucasfilm, so they could make this??? C'mon Disney I'm a big Star Wars fan but this is a joke.",3.0,8 June 2024

I will never un see the disgrace that was the acolyte and deal with the damage that was done to Star Wars from making this.

What happened to the Clone Wars? Rebels? Or even The Christmas Special? This is by far the worst thing I have seen in the last 15 years.

First the acting feels cardboard, forced and even wooden at times. None of the actors or actresses in this show are used to anywhere near their potential, it is like they are just there for a check. The directing is all over the place, pacing?? What's that? Battlefield Earth was better than this. Costume and set design feels cheap, for a 180mil USD you would think it would be better. And makeup... no.. just no. There have been better fan fiction films on Youtube with less than .1% of the budget done better.

My fiancee and I are huge fans and we are really enjoying it so far. Don't jump on the trolls reviews as gossip. If you love Star Wars, you'll love this.

You have the high republic era and finally no empire or Skywalkers nor Palpatine but they still manage to make something this dull.

Star Wars has been handed down to the wrong people.

How are the trailers to the old republic (which doesn't even look anything like the trailers), better than this? And that game is 13 years old.. It's because the creators knew what people wanted.

I only give 9 out of 10 is because I don't understand why Vernestra is so different from her book version. But I am really looking forward to finding it out. She and Avar Chriss were the pillars of the High Republic for me.

Lucas should be ashamed of himself for allowing this to proceed.

Thanks for ruining star wars as much as possible,"This show was such a letdown. My wife and I are huge Star Wars fans-we've watched the movies more times than I can count. And let's not even talk about Clone Wars we've binged it at least three times! So, you can imagine how excited we were for Acolyte after seeing those trailers. It looked like it had everything we love: dark side mysteries, ancient Sith lore, and intense lightsaber duels. But man, were we wrong. We gave up after two episodes because it just felt...off. They had a decent idea but totally fumbled it.

The characters were all over the place, the plot dragged slower than a Jawa sandcrawler, and the dialogue? Don't even get me started. It felt like they stripped out all the good Star Wars stuff-the pulse-pounding moments, the characters you root for.

What's really frustrating is that Disney+ has been knocking it out of the park with shows like The Mandalorian and Clone Wars. We were really hoping Acolyte* lwould be another win, but it was a total miss. Luckily, there's still a galaxy of amazing Star Wars content out there. We're rewatching the classics and diving back into the awesome animated shows-there's so much good stuff! If you're craving a Star Wars fix, skip this BS and revisit those gems instead. Trust me, you won't regret it.

This isn't just me venting (okay, maybe a little). This is a message to the folks making these Star Wars shows. Us fans want stories that feel like real Star Wars! We want characters we can connect with, adventures that blow our minds, and all that classic Star Wars charm. We know Disney+ can deliver that kind of magic, and we're holding out hope for something truly epic next time around.

Ugh,"I will consume all things star wars, no matter what it is I'll watch and even enjoy shows/movies that are typically considered bad. The acolyte, however, is the most boring thing I've ever seen with space wizards and laser swords. The pace grinds, the story is convoluted, and the characters are all lacking any personality. They're being portrayed as Jedi with feelings, unfortunately they all have the emotional range of Channing Tatum, if Channing Tatum had been dead for six years that is. However, it is still star wars and I'll watch it to the end, but at this point I might just be watching it out of spite. Do better Disney.",3.0,12 June 2024
HOW did they muck this up?!?,"Star Wars. It sells itself. Be true to the OG movies and give a nodding acquaintance to all the sequels/prequals as appropriate. Throw in some ILM level SFX, get a top whack writer and director, hire a couple of well known and a lot of up and coming actors, sprinkle some special 'force' sauce, simmer to build excitement and then release.

Two episodes in, the only person capable of acting is CA Moss. Everyone else, and everything thing else feels like it's done by kids on work experience?

Wooden 'acting', average (by the high standards set previously) SFX and thus far a really boring plot. I HOPE it gets better and I come back and eat my words. I won't re-write my review, I'll just add edits.

However, we are happy that despite the low IMBD rating, we decided to ignore the reviews, and watch it!

We just finished the first 2 episodes of the ""Acolyte"" and can't wait for the next ones.

The reasons we like this show, is because it has an excellent plot, it is fast pace and the characters are likable and unique. Also the picture, location and creatures are very well made. Finally I am happily surprised that it is so much better than most of the new star wars ""universe"", we have watched lately, and have slow dark weird plots.",10.0,8 June 2024

One of the worst scripts by Disney it's not worthy even playing in the background utter rubbish acting from every point of view.

I love female leads and I'm really hoping that this series continues the path that Ahsoka, Rey, and Leia forged, in bringing strong women to the forefront of heroism.

The acolyte has everything in production values that would make it a great addition to the Star Wars universe, but unfortunately truly boring casting is once again the biggest problem. The main characters totally lack any sense charisma and interest that would keep the viewers interested in their journey. Amandla stenberg has about two facial expressions, and the one with her lips touting with dislike, gets really old, really fast. Could not care less about her character after watching two episodes.

It's going for the dark, more adult feel of ""Andor"" but the story telling doesn't match up. We're digging through the same ""historical"" remnants of SW canon that been done to death already.

The characters are great so far, with Sol being my favorite. The fighting scenes and the jedi martial arts are something we have never seen before and it makes so much sense that a jedi should be effevtive in hand 2 hand combat.

Garbage,"Many aspects of this show are either mediocre or just plain awful. The dialogue and action scenes feel out of place at times while the acting is cringe with a number of actors. Aesthetically, the show looks cheap; from character designs to the environments, but how is that possible when the Acolyte is the most expensive Star Wars show to date on Disney+. Despite the slow burn from Andor, that show looks beautiful in many ways with great dialogue. Not sure if I'll continue with this show since the setup from the first two episodes was uninspiring and dull.

The story could have gone a path that leads to the prequels with Darth Plagues(Palpatine's Master). However, it seems the acolyte is trying to cater to a new audience, but in reality it does a terrible job at that.",1.0,7 June 2024

He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.

Trash made by trash,"(i got this from Chatgpt bc i hate this show so much and didnt want to write a real review) I had high hopes for ""The Acolyte,"" but what a letdown. It's like the creators threw every cliché from every sci-fi and fantasy genre into a blender, hit puree, and hoped for the best. The result? A confusing, disjointed mess that left me more frustrated than entertained.

First off, the characters are about as deep as a kiddie pool. I couldn't connect with any of them because they're so poorly developed. The protagonist is your typical chosen one with a mysterious past, and the supporting cast might as well be cardboard cutouts for all the personality they bring to the table.

And don't get me started on the plot-or lack thereof. It jumps around so much that I felt like I was watching a slideshow on fast forward. There's no coherent story arc, no satisfying resolution, just a series of random events strung together haphazardly.

But perhaps the biggest sin of all is the world-building-or lack thereof. Instead of immersing us in a rich, detailed universe, ""The Acolyte"" gives us a half-baked setting that feels like it was cribbed from a dozen other, better franchises. There's nothing original or memorable here, just recycled tropes and tired clichés.

Acolyte,"After watching the first episodes of Acolyte, I can't say that the series lived up to my expectations. Despite the impressive viewing figures, the quality of the content leaves much to be desired. The plot seems boring and predictable, and the actors' acting does not reach the expected level. The characters do not evoke empathy, their motives and actions seem unconvincing. In addition, the narrative can sometimes be chaotic, which makes it difficult to immerse yourself in the world of Star Wars. Overall, the series falls short of the established franchise standards, and I hope that subsequent episodes will correct these shortcomings.""",1.0,7 June 2024
Expectations exceeded!,"I was quite disappointed when I watched Kenobi (felt cheap), Boba Fett (soft, cheap and somehow pointless) and Ashoka (did not touch me as I thought it would). I take out Andor, because it very much separates itself from all of the series. I'm quite a big Star Wars Fan since my childhood. Perhaps I just had too high expectations. By the Acolyte I was very much positiv suprised. It fells earned and for the first time, we see a Star Wars outside the Skywalker Saga. I found the character development, acting, effects and locations great. The storybuilding makes me excited for more. Im pretty sure we will have many flashbacks in the other episodes to come. The only hope I have after watching the episodes 1+2 is that we don't see another reediming story - Bad turns good and so on. It is really ok, when a charakter dies. I just had too much of surviving from the death like in Ashoka.

The Star Wars Universe has its own reality for sience. The Acolyte did not earned to be judged or spoken down because of the fire in space. Really guys?!?! If you really get annoyed by the fire extinguisher scene I think you should stop watch Star Wars anyways. It is fiction guys!

This is an example of failed leadership at Disney. Obviously no one was willing to step forward and speak up about how bad this is. The look and feel is just so different than any other Star Wars, it feels like a show directed by high schoolers. The characters all feel young and immature and not taking anything serious.

The way they shoot the combat sequences is ridiculous, why are they fighting like it's the matrix. They gave away a key character plot quite obviously in the first episode. The costume design is mid, world building not what it used to be. Main character going full karate against a ""Jedi Master"" who floats two stories of stairs and fights her like she's Neo. Also the lightsaber hilt's are like Pringle's cans.

Utter Garbage,"If you want to watch a tv show made by women that hate the fan base and want the franchise to fail then look no further. This is a new low in story telling in the Star Wars universe. The plot and twists are of the quality of a 5 year old child and I mean no offence to any children's story telling. I'm sure it's much better. George Lucas must be reeling that his franchise has been destroyed by a company that hates its fans for being ""white men"" and continues to butcher source material in this fashion. RIP Star Wars. It was fun while it lasted. Hopefully Andor season 2 will not disappoint. The Acolyte is pure tosh.",2.0,11 June 2024
Star Wars: Acolyte - A Disappointing Addition to the Galaxy,"As a long-time Star Wars fan, I was eagerly anticipating the release of ""Star Wars: Acolyte."" Unfortunately, the series has proven to be a major letdown in almost every aspect. Despite the potential for an intriguing story set in a largely unexplored era, ""Acolyte"" falls flat with its weak plot, lackluster characters, and inconsistent pacing.

The story, which promised to delve into the dark side of the Force and the rise of the Sith, is disappointingly thin and predictable. Instead of providing a fresh and engaging narrative, it recycles tired tropes and fails to offer any meaningful insights into the Star Wars universe. The plot progression feels disjointed, with numerous subplots that either go nowhere or are resolved in an unsatisfying manner.

Character development is another major issue. The protagonists are bland and forgettable, lacking the depth and complexity that made characters in previous Star Wars installments so memorable. The supposed villain, meant to be a menacing and formidable presence, comes off as one-dimensional and unconvincing. Even the performances by the cast, who seem to be trying their best with the material they were given, cannot save these poorly written characters.

The pacing of the series is also problematic. The episodes drag on with unnecessary exposition and filler scenes, making it a chore to sit through. Action sequences, which should be a highlight in any Star Wars production, are few and far between and lack the excitement and spectacle one would expect. When the action does occur, it feels rushed and poorly choreographed.

Visually, ""Acolyte"" does have some redeeming qualities with its impressive special effects and set designs. However, these are not enough to compensate for the series' numerous shortcomings. The overall aesthetic, while polished, cannot mask the lack of substance and engagement in the storytelling.

In conclusion, ""Star Wars: Acolyte"" is a disappointing addition to the franchise. It fails to live up to its potential and delivers a forgettable and uninspired experience. Fans of the galaxy far, far away deserve better than this lackluster series. Save your time and rewatch the classic Star Wars films or explore other expanded universe content instead.",1.0,12 June 2024
Not even space can extinguish the fires at Disney,"At its core, ""The Acolyte"" promises an intriguing premise: exploring the dark side of the Force during the final days of the High Republic era. Yet, despite this promising foundation, the series falters almost immediately due to its weak and inconsistent writing. The narrative is riddled with clichés and uninspired dialogue, which strips away any potential depth or nuance.

Fans of the Star Wars franchise deserve better than this lackluster offering, and it is a shame to see such a rich universe squandered by a show that fails to deliver on almost every front.

If ""The Acolyte"" is any indication of the direction future Star Wars projects might take, then the galaxy far, far away is in dire need of a course correction.",2.0,10 June 2024
K Kennedy gots to go!,"Business school teaches you that the primary purpose of any company is to create value for the stakeholder. But the lead of the Star Wars division instead is working to alienate its core audience. This isnt Star Wars, this is a pedestrian teenage angst story cloaked in jedi tuniks with a couple of light sabers thrown in for camouflage. The cast seems okay too, but the story is so weak it wouldnt have passed muster as a 1970's after school special. 180 million dollars for this??

lost touch with what Star Wars truly is,"Overall, ""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" feels like another poor attempt by Disney, which seems to have lost touch with what Star Wars truly is and has once again ignored the fans, pushing them away from the franchise. So far, the soundtrack feels lackluster and jarring. The characters are wooden in places, and the costumes and makeup leave much to be desired, with noticeable flaws like visible bald caps and poor makeup. The legacy of colored lightsabers has been discarded, replaced with Force kung fu. It seems that those who worked on this show had no understanding of the essence of Star Wars. One of the few positives is the special effects, which look good, but the story feels lackluster and disappointing so far. Perhaps in the future, Disney will release a Star Wars project that is universally loved, but sadly, that is not the case today. Who knows what the future will bring.",1.0,6 June 2024
Nothing great but better than other Star Wars shows,"I'll preface that I think it should be rated in the 6/7 range but gave it an 8 to offset the other reviews Not a compelling story but it works. The twin dynamic is a good scenario for exploring how the light/dark side of the force isn't set in stone. How one can go either way based on the circumstances. Besides the main character, none of the characters are memorable yet I'm only 2 episodes in. The action sequences are better than other Star Wars shows. The main problem with the latest Star Wars shows (besides Andor) is they refuse to create stand alone stories. Instead they make stories that only matter in how they link back to the original movies. So far it seems like this show is attempting to create an original story, though I wouldn't hold my breath and I imagine it will end with this story resulting in nothing more than setting up the phantom menace

So far I think it's worth watching.",8.0,12 June 2024
Disney is ruining Star Wars,"It is ridiculous how far the producers have ruined what could have been a great series. The execution is the worst yet in the Star Wars franchise since Disney has meddled. I had such great expectations of what this series could be and I was excited to watch it, but the extreme amount of political correctness and pushing of the director/producers views has ruined it. I miss the days when a well written Star Wars film had zero political agenda and pushed no view point. It is a fictional universe and we can't have a release away from the strife of everyday life because someone feels the need to make a statement. I wish we could have a show with no pressures in either direction and focused on the storyline like the original trilogy.",2.0,13 June 2024

All of the retcons are exacerbated by terrible directing and writing. It's amusing, Disney shareholders voted to keep the same personnel in charge despite the internal metrics not being so hot. Perhaps, Disney hasn't learned their lesson.

Mysteriously boring mystery,"I am not here to hate on this show because of women in lead roles, minority characters, or anything LGBTQA+ related. I don't dislike this show for any hateful, bigoted reasons. I dislike this show because it is boring, the acting is a bit wooden, the writing is clunky, and the whole thing turns around a mystery that is not half as interesting as the writers think. I don't mean to be a crank, but it just seems like when SW revolves around the Jedi Sith thing, SW gets boring. Partly this comes down to taste, but my personal taste is that good writing, directing, editing, scoring, wardrobe, and VFX beats kung fu and lightsabers any day. This is SW YA, and it isn't even good YA fiction. I will finish the series because that's how I roll, but I won't be surprised if I end up disliking this as much as Ahsoka or BOBF. And I won't rewatch nor recommend this to anyone. If you haven't started it, don't bother.",3.0,12 June 2024
Not sure if you're ready to cancel Disney yet? The Acolyte can help!,"If Disney was actively trying to make the worst show using the most amount of money possible, I don't think they could have. It's that bad. Bad writing, poor acting, and.... of course... the agenda. But I love Star Wars so much I'd be even willing to overlook the ""stunning and brave"" Hollywood ethos they're shoving down everyone's throats, but it is simply not good television. The dialogue was choppy and no connection is created between the characters and the audience. The first two episodes were already bad enough but this third episode takes the cake for worst Star Wars episode/movie/cartoon ever.

How dare the smug director and cast make fun of the fans, without the fans they are nothing. The interview they did really highlights how out of touch with reality they are. It's almost like they don't care about their work and how it's received. The fact that they have the ordasity to take cheap shots at a fan base thats done nothing but be loyal just shows you what kind of people they are and it shows through their work on screen, lacklustre, disjointed, empty and agenda driven.

After episode one and two it was extremely obvious this show was going to be hot garbage but my god I didn't realize it could get any worse. I've watched fan made Star Wars videos on YouTube that's better than this show, that's crazy.

Worth the watch,"Jeeze folks can be so judgmental... to the haters that say the ""old"" people are too nostalgic... you'll get there one day, but as an ""old"" people I am enjoying this show. I like the ever expanding universe they're trying to build. Showing us new stories and characters taking place in different eras of this broad story. Yes, it probably isn't the best property, but give it a chance to spread its wings before you try to pluck them off. The story is engaging enough for me to want to see where they take it... there are a lot of characters that have been introduced and it will take some time to fully develop them. It very well could end up a dumpster fire, but I'm willing to see it through.",8.0,6 June 2024
What A Streaming Pile of Content,"It's corporatized big-budget streaming content. No more, no less. The first two episodes looked pretty good and they decently recaptured the Star Wars aesthetic. Performances were generally fine; the writing was a bit lackluster but it wasn't so terrible as to be distracting most of the time. The whole thing was just bland and sterile. No excitement, no investment; just cardboard characters going through the motions while the visuals and score try to make you care.

So far it isn't the worst thing Disney has done to this once-beloved IP from either a lore or a story/production standpoint. But it also doesn't seem like it'll be good enough to win back apathetic former fans or reverse Star Wars' downward trend in perceived quality and cultural relevance.",4.0,5 June 2024
Poorly written Disney culture wars,"If you want to push politics, wouldn't you be more successful if you at least made something with a plot and an entertaining story? Maybe try to use characters that are likeable. I think the most entertaining aspect of this show, is that they still think that this is ground breaking. What would be ground breaking would be a show that didn't have a painfully forced ""diverse"" cast, that entertained you instead of trying to push young viewers into one side of the political spectrum. Star wars was universally loved, already diverse, already taught good morals. Now it is universally disliked. Hmmm.",1.0,6 June 2024
Not Star Wars,"""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" fell short in several critical areas, ultimately delivering a disappointing experience for fans. The writing lacked the depth and creativity that have defined the Star Wars saga, resulting in a narrative that felt disjointed and uninspired. The dialogue was often clunky, and the plot failed to engage the audience or provide the excitement expected from a Star Wars story.

The performances from the cast were underwhelming. Many characters felt one-dimensional, and the actors seemed unable to breathe life into their roles. This lack of compelling performances contributed to the overall feeling that the show was not up to the high standards set by previous Star Wars entries.

Moreover, ""The Acolyte"" did not capture the quintessential essence of a Star Wars story. The magic, adventure, and epic scope that are hallmarks of the franchise were noticeably absent. The show struggled to immerse viewers in the Star Wars universe, lacking the familiar elements that make the galaxy far, far away so beloved by fans.

Despite its attempts at diversity, the show failed to achieve genuine inclusivity. The representation felt superficial and did not contribute meaningfully to the story or character development. Additionally, the show missed incorporating key elements that define the Star Wars experience, such as the dynamic interplay of the Force, the complex moral dilemmas, and the rich, expansive lore that fans have come to expect.

In summary, ""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" was a misstep for the franchise. Its poor writing, lackluster acting, failure to evoke the Star Wars spirit, and superficial approach to diversity left much to be desired. Fans looking for the magic of Star Wars would be better served revisiting the original films and beloved series that truly capture the heart of the galaxy.",1.0,12 June 2024
"Great concept, poor execution","I wanted to love this project. However, what we have is a sluggish narrative marred by terrible dialogue and poor execution. The pacing drags, making it difficult to stay engaged, and the dialogue feels unnatural and forced, stripping away any potential emotional impact. Overall, the execution falls short, failing to deliver the captivating experience I had hoped for.

There are moments of inspiration; the first fight scene featured some great choreography that vividly brought the otherworldly nature of the force welders to life. Unfortunately, this excitement was dampened when the scene was oddly repeated step for step in the second episode.

There are rumors of a second season. If true, the creators need to spend more time on the plot, pacing, and narration to truly bring this story to life. It has promise, but right now, all I see are problems..",3.0,8 June 2024

I brushed it off as shows written for kids, I might simply be a tad too old to understand.

Master Sol is my favourite so far, with major Qui Gonn Jinn vibes leading the way. It's amazing to be in an era where there is no Empire or memory of the Empire. How will this lead into the later stories? Maybe it won't, at least not directly.

The only positive thing I have to say is the fight scenes were good. There were a lot of awkward interactions between characters.

Bait and switch use of Carrie-Anne Moss in all the trailers diminishes her role and the value of the IP. If the IP is truly valuable please honour it or quit with the bait and switch. Non-sensical dialogue with villain saying where are they? When they have literally conducted a stakeout is again lazy. Hope there is at least some logic in upcoming episodes.

It's refreshing to see the first live action attempt in the Disney era that is removed from the Skywalker Era and one that doesn't need a ""I remember him"" moment to carry the story.

I find the first two episodes offer enough excitement and intrigue for you to want more. Fight actions are awesome and a new take using angles & martial arts combination. It's an excellent start and something different from the normal Star Wars saga.

Yet another disappointment,"I don't understand Disney as a company anymore. I am absolutely confounded as to why Disney is so hard pressed to take every franchise that are like 90% enjoyed and supported by guys and try and forcefully shift the audience to be for girls. Why would they do this? Instead of gearing your shows and movies towards a specific audience (this has been how business has done throughout all of time until the year 2019) you try to make it ""for everyone"" which actually takes the soul out of the product and ends up being for no one in the end. It's sad and very strange. Why would any company do this when it's been proven time and time again that it doesn't work for the last 5 years. It would be the same as taking Barbie (clearly a product geared towards girls) and forcefully diverge to catering to guys. Of course guys can like Barbie products if they want but in the end it's going to turn away their main audience away since the product isn't being made for them anymore, and then no one will enjoy it. This is exactly what's being done in ""The Acolyte"". The force is female is now at the front and center of the SW universe and I will never understand it.",1.0,8 June 2024

This series has gone down hill since The Mandalorian,I do enjoy the Star Wars films and the previous series. Obi Wan was amazing and I really enjoyed The Mandalorian but since then the last few series have been awful. Disney seem to be more interested in making sure any lead characters are not white males rather than concentrating on a story line. The storyline is muddy and the characters are poor with bad acting. Maybe this is the future of Star Wars and not meant for my generation. I grew up with Star Wars movies and I do enjoy that world they created but Disney have really killed any future for the franchise.

Star Wars murdered with a blade and not with a light saber,"The politics of this show aside, which made me nauseous is not the worst thing about it. The story is poorly told.

This looks like a Cash grab that paid the pockets of producers and none of the money made it to the film. It's unfortunate.

The rumors are that episode three is supposed to be the worst one that will turn all Star Wars fans away. I've decided to give it another go and watch it.

8 episodes will be too short,"I see that the show is trying to do the whole buildup and pay off ordeal.

But fundamentally for that to work, you would have to do that by getting the audience sufficiently invested in the story's characters. And that is very hard to do with 8 episodes (30~40 minutes a piece). You would need multiple seasons to make the audience actually care about the characters and the overall story.

The Acolyte made the hilarious mistake that the audience would immediately care about their new characters just because they're wearing Jedi robes.

In just 2 episodes the show introduces a handful of seemingly important characters:

Indara? Mae? Osha? Yord? Sol? Vernestra? Torbin? Jecki? Qmir? (And out of them, two just die right off the bat.)

That's a whole lot of characters.

And they're ""just there"" either wearing Jedi robes or talking in ""Star Wars Speak."" The introduction of the overall tone (murder-mystery) isn't even intriguing enough because I didn't have enough information about these new characters.

And it concerns me that this show only had 8 episodes which only indicates that every 2nd or 3rd episode will dump a ""rushed pay off"" or ""random cliff hanger"" to force the show to be interesting.

The show is unfortunately not interesting. The writing lacks basic charm and the direction is very amateurish for a franchise IP project.

And you could forgive the stilted acting and directing if the show was entertaining but it's not.

Star Wars was pulpy and fun and this show is neither and that does not mean you can't have serious dramatic stories in star wars, Andor proved that was possible.

Meh,"What this gets credit for is trying something different. This is fundamentally a murder mystery a very popular format telling a story but one that's never been in the Star Wars universe before. Also, this is set 100 years before the more familiar events so therefore there will be no usual characters, except possibly a cameo from Yoda at some point.

The production budget is there for all to see. A huge amount of effort has gone into it. But it being a century earlier, it doesn't feel like it's in a different time to the other events. They could've added a slight steam punk element to it or other flavours, instead you could comfortably see these characters walking along with Luke Skywalker. So that idea hasn't really worked.

People talk about the ""agenda"". I think what they mean is there is a noticeable absence of any white men. It does seem a deliberate choice but it's not like the entire program is talking about issues that really don't have a lot to do with Star Wars. The cast is all good although the script is pedestrian. Saying that though Star Wars was never known for its sophisticated plots or dialogue. What it is, is a very high value production of a murder mystery, and in regards to that it's fine.

Toilet Main,"Disney's 'Acolyte' is a lot like a council steam roller - it moves at a snail's pace and destroys everything in its path due to their staunch democratic ways of socialism that kill the whole concept of inclusion when it excludes us 70s fans who originally built this empire only to see it crumble and burn down in agony.

You could compare this latest offering from Lucasfilm to the shops in Los Angeles and San Francisco today: deserted, empty, and soulless.

I think it's about time the tables were turned to cancel this Star Wars culture.

To leave left-wing activists in charge of a children's company that grooms and indoctrinates young minds with adult matters is morally wrong.

And to have Grace Jones on the bottom of the poster pulling gang signs in the form of 2 L's is just juvenile. What is that strong female character actually representing with her fingers - low ratings and low income?

What a joke! Star Wars has now become a parody and has lost respect from seasoned fans.

Headland has tapped into a dystopian universe directly from an underground commode pipe system that smears our TV screens with rich rubbish, leaving stains that can't be wiped away. Not to mention the stench. Think combination turkey and a week-old corpse.

We all could see this coming,"It is obvious that the people involved in this show didn't have an actual story to tell. Rather, they had an agenda and nothing else.

Now to start, it is a terrible ""evil twin"" trope based series. Now, ask yourself, how many times has the ""evil twin"" trope actually produced a good story? 99% of evil twin stories are terrible and the acolyte is no exception.

The show is full of logical inconsistencies, seriously nothing makes sense. Every solution the heroes come up with are non-sensical. I found myself sitting there wondering how someone could write this and think it was any good.

Honestly we could all see a series like this coming a mile away. It was the natural culmination of Disney handling the Star Wars franchise.",2.0,11 June 2024
Who wrote this!!!!,"This is not the Star Wars we all know and love. This is warped beyond imagination. The writing is lazy and mundane. Three episodes in and we have no emotional ties to any of the charters, you can smell all of the ""twist"" a mile away, and everything seems one dimensional. Are we lead to believe that good is bad and bad is good? Is the Acolyte trying to tell us that the Jedi are evil...especially with the last episode? It feels like this show could have been it's own entity without it being related to Star Wars and they chose it just because how popular the name is and decided to ride it out. Will not be watching this dumpster fire from here on out.",1.0,12 June 2024
The Star Wars Holiday Special loses its place as the worst ever...,"The show seems like it was written to be a 4-5th grade level play written by some emo teen that wants to share their pain with the world.

The show uses names and references we all know like Jedi, the Force, etc. Beyond that, the writers had no idea what they were doing. Star Wars was made great because of the story. Take that away and the franchise is nothing more than a ""B"" movie. Disney does not realize you cannot sell Star Wars on the name alone.

I think this is a good show to highlight which YouTube reactors are fakes. The plot seems to make sense on the surface, but once they explore it a bit, the irrationality of the show emerges. It doesn't matter if you are a Star Wars fan. The show is simply written badly; it's nothing more than loony bait hoping YouTube reactors will hype the show despite it's lack of quality. $$

To think there are all of these awesome EU stories already out there, but Disney and Lucas basically gave them the finger (by mutilating some of their material and using it) and not stopping to think: Um, these EU writers have done a lot to keep the franchise alive between movies.

"""Star Wars: The Acolyte - A Colossal Disappointment Unworthy of the Star Wars Legacy""","""Star Wars: The Acolyte is a colossal disappointment, an utter misstep that tarnishes the legacy of the Star Wars franchise. The plot is incoherent, riddled with inconsistencies, and the characters are painfully underdeveloped, leaving no one to root for. The special effects are shockingly subpar, failing to deliver the visual spectacle one expects from a Star Wars series. The dialogue is awkward and stilted, making it difficult to engage with the story. Even the most dedicated Star Wars fans will struggle to find any redeeming qualities in this poorly executed mess.

Moreover, it's clear that the series has been sacrificed on the altar of political correctness and forced inclusion, detracting from its potential to be a genuinely engaging narrative. Instead of focusing on compelling storytelling, The Acolyte feels more like a checklist of diversity quotas, resulting in a show that feels disingenuous and superficial. This approach undermines the rich, expansive universe that Star Wars fans have cherished for decades. Sadly, The Acolyte is not worthy of the Star Wars name.""",1.0,7 June 2024
Doesn't even feel like it takes place in the same franchise,"I am an avid player of SWTOR since Launch in 2012 I think, I have put 7000+ hours into that game. The plot in this story is lifted from that game but made worse. In the game it's two kids, one is taken as a jedi the other taken in by Mandalorians, seeking revenge against Jedi. A lot of ideas from this show are lifted from that game but executed poorly.

Overall this show feels like something you'd watch on CW but like CW 10 years ago. It doesn't appeal to my friends or myself (20-30s), kids I know don't like it or care, in fact this doesn't even let children decide their path, it just pushes one on them. There's a timeless feel about good pre-Disney Star Wars (though Mandalorian was decent), that this just doesn't have.

The Jedi in this series feel nothing like how they should. Action scenes are strange as well. None of the characters are likeable or even have charisma. Just no.

Waste your money on Disney + if you want but you'll regret is as you discover this is easily the worst tv show for Star Wars thus far, and just bad TV generally. Similar disappointment as the Sequel Trilogy. I've only seen 4 episodes but the 4 I have seen are terrible.",1.0,8 June 2024
A galaxy away from being worth your time,"As a lifetime Star Wars fan I forced myself to watch the third episode having convinced myself it couldn't possibly be as bad as the first two. I was wrong. This is honestly shockingly bad. I wish I could have back every minute wasted watching this train wreck.

The premise is workable, but the execution from the writing, casting and directing is an unfortunate stain on the Star Wars franchise. Painfully boring, simple and juvenile. It misses the mark on everything that made the franchise a multigenerational hit. Within minutes it couldn't be more clear the people behind this disaster have never been Star Wars enthusiasts and made no sincere attempt to capture its magic. The magnitude of the miss here by Disney is as baffling as it is disappointing.",2.0,12 June 2024
Below average,"What is this series? Is this really the script? How could the dialogues be so bad? If I'd had a month, I would have put together a better one, and I have no experience. They would have rather spent the budget on other things. And who are these cast members? A botoxed 80 year old has more emotions sitting on there face!!! If they didn't want to play a role, why did they accept it? WTH... 3 stars only, but that's for the visuals, not that it helps anything on this show, jesus.

They might wonder why they should NOT work with such a director and such a level of acting. Because this is by far the worst Star Wars series I have ever seen, and I thought they would never fall this low.

"Not really sure what this is, but it is not Star Wars","Mad Max movie without Mad Max, Willow tv show without Willow, Star Wars without... Star Wars...

I'm just baffled why this show was made because this isn't the first time Disney flopped Star Wars. Anything from Boba Fett to their Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser hotel closure should've been an indication they are going in the wrong direction.

They bought a cash cow and instead of milking it, they slaughtered the cow. This is perhaps one of the biggest monumental screw ups in recent film/franchise history other than The Ring of Power. You have not simply purchased the rights to Star Wars, but the millions upon millions of ""paying"" customers. Instead of continuing giving the customers what they want, you decide to do what you want while pushing them away.

There is absolutely nothing Star Wars about The Acolyte. Jedis don't act like Jedis, force is not the force, and the whole thing is like a cheap knock off of Rebel Moon. Rather than focusing and understanding what is Star Wars, you use it to push an agenda that is constantly being rejected by the culture again and again.

And to top it off, campfire in the vacuum of space. The defenders of this quickly points out the SSD exploding in Return of the Jedi. SSD, as all starships, have life support system or oxygen. When it crashed, it created explosion where the flame burns the oxygen until it is consumed in a ball.

It is just tragically hilarious this generation doesn't know basic science. The sun is ball of hydrogen and helium, thus it is burning continuously in space. However, without such gases, you cannot have a fire in space.

"People say its fan fiction, but no fan would get so much wrong","Seen a number of reviews saying this if fan fiction at best, and the visuals are great. So I actually watched the first 2 episodes again to see what I missed (short answer is I missed a lot of alcohol and I am not a drinker).

First lets address the fan fiction, is the quality of the writing at that level, maybe at the maturity level, but I would say any Star wars fan (or even someone with any experience with star wars) would write better fan fiction. Take the Jedi for example almost all of them are either not representative of everything we know a jedi should represent or are just silly. Look at the supposed Jedi Knight Yord Fandar. What a git, he is closer to the incompetent Zapp Brannigan from Futurama that a Jedi, hell he does the same oh woops I am naked in front of people gag, he is not mature enough to be a Padawan never mind a Jedi Knight.

Now to the visuals, look some of the sets look ok, some of the practical effects or good as well, unfortunately every time you feel the quality is ok the cut to a droid or something else that just looks cheap. I mean take a look at the Image of the Jedi Temple city shot, Same temple as in the prequels except it looks like the only copy of the footage the Acolyte team could find of the building was from a vintage worn VHS tape. In fact it may be the inconsistency that cusses me problems, if you watch original BSG or Space 1999 the effects are corny nowadays but your brain kind of accepts it as the baseline. This show has good effects followed by bad effects and that is jarring .",2.0,11 June 2024
"Yikes, what a weird/week start.","I'm not sure who this is trying to appeal to, but it's not wait I had hoped for after the success of Andor and Asoka (sans the last episode). The acting is sub-par, the FX feels outdated, and the storyline hasn't gone anywhere yet.

I'm going to keep watching, but I'm not jonesing it for it. I wish Star Wars would branch deeper into the grittier side of the galaxy or go deeper into the flaws of the Jedi Order. So far this feels like just another commercial to try to sell toys.

With that said, it's only two episode in and I would be happy to be proven wrong and some fantastics story and character development comes along.",5.0,5 June 2024

"Not only is Reading Fundimental, so is writing.","Here we go again. Another Star Wars TV show trying to profit from the nostalgia and the Intellectual Property that has spanned generations of fans.

And yet again it's crap.

Writing. Writing. Writing.

I don't care if everyone has unusual hair colors and has sex with everything that moves. That's not the problem with the latest batch of shows.

You can't just say ""we will make them all diverse"" and decide on how a few key scenes each episode are to be done and they hand wave off the writing everything in between. You need a reason for those various scenes to happen and to link them to the next scene as well as the larger story.

This is what good writers do. They actually write a narrative story that ties all the pink hair, weird sex scenes and light Saber sequences together so it all makes sense. Very good writers adhear to Canon wherever possible and string together a story that no only connects the funny hair, the weird sex and the lightsaber battles together BUT also tie it in to the existing Intelectual Property so it feels like part of a cohesive whole that one can make the viewers believe was always planned to be done by the creator even if he had zero plans beyond the one movie.

This is why the shows are failing.

Want to see how it's done? Look at the Fallout series. They managed to take a VIDEO GAME and make a story so strong and compelling there are REAL LIFE WOMEN who want to date the GHOUL!!! Have any of the recent Star Wars movies and TV shoes made a single character that anyone has wanted to date? I can't think of any. They're all so badly written that no one wants to touch those charachters much less date them.",1.0,9 June 2024
Sadly looks like an 80s cop movie!,"I'm a fan of Star Wars, especially the prequel.

I liked some series made by Disney, like Asoka, Kenobi and the Mandalorian.

At first I found the series careless with details, for example, we have explosions in space throughout the franchise, but I have never seen a fire on the outside of the ship, which is put out with a fire extinguisher, IN SPACE! As happens in ep.1

But the worst thing is the way the Jedi order is shown, it looks like a cop movie from the 80s. The Jedi temple from the second episode, It looks like a police station. The ambush by the Jedi, complete with binoculars and searchlight???? They look cops, not Jedi Knights.

Even though it is something that happens 100 years earlier, the way it acts and the structure demonstrates a Jedi order that looks more like a police force than defenders of peace!

I do not know how Disney is able to produce this amount of garbage with all the resources they have. This is also a good example for a show with zero effort. It is a content for the many because you gonna watch due to the Star Wars logo.

I think after the new sequels Lucas arts/disney should have fired Kennedy and start it with a clean sheet but no they continue to produce incoherent soulless content.

Some of them were good, many were not. This is what The Acolyte feels like to me. Just another generic copycat space show that happens to have Jedi in it.

If you cast your talent net far and wide and try to include everything and everyone in one catch, you end up with dozens of individual elements with no real connection to each other or their environment, including the storyline.

Im getting tired of watching the first few episodes of all these half baked star wars shows. Probably wont even bother with the next. I know the ""CW"" meme has been overused, but the constant pumping out of lame, over dramatic, awful cgi is real with Disney right now.

Unbearable!,"I approached the second episode of ""The Acolyte"" with a sense of reluctant hope, having already found the first episode underwhelming. Unfortunately, my optimism was short-lived, as this episode only deepened my disappointment. The show struggles on multiple fronts, from its plot and dialogue to the acting and action sequences, making it a challenging watch.

The plot, for starters, is exceedingly thin. Rather than a well-constructed narrative, the storyline feels fragmented and lacks coherence, failing to engage the audience. Each scene seems disjointed, and the overall direction of the story remains unclear. This lack of a compelling plot makes it difficult to invest in the characters or care about their journeys. In a genre that thrives on intricate storytelling and rich world-building, ""The Acolyte"" falls remarkably short.

The acting further exacerbates the show's problems. Performances across the board are lackluster, with characters coming off as one-dimensional and unconvincing. It's hard to pinpoint whether the fault lies more with the actors or the direction they received, but the end result is the same: a cast that fails to bring their characters to life. This is particularly disappointing given the potential depth and complexity that such a narrative could explore.

Poor dialogue compounds these issues. The conversations between characters are stilted and unnatural, lacking the nuance and wit that can make even the most mundane exchanges compelling. Instead, viewers are subjected to wooden lines delivered without conviction, which strips the show of any emotional weight or authenticity. Good dialogue is crucial in developing character relationships and advancing the plot, but ""The Acolyte"" misses the mark entirely.

Lastly, the action sequences are sub-par and fail to inject the excitement and tension one would expect from a series in this genre. The choreography feels uninspired, and the special effects are unimpressive. Action scenes that should be thrilling and dynamic come off as slow and predictable, lacking the energy and intensity needed to captivate the audience.

In summary, ""The Acolyte"" is a series marred by a weak plot, poor acting, uninspired dialogue, and unimpressive action sequences. Despite forcing myself to watch the second episode in the hope that it might improve, I found the show unbearable. It fails to deliver on nearly every front, making it a tedious and unenjoyable viewing experience. For a show set in such a rich and imaginative universe, ""The Acolyte"" is a profound disappointment.",1.0,8 June 2024

I've found a way to enjoy it (sort of),"If you are learning any language, I highly recommend switching the sound settings. The level of dialog is A1 at maximum, and because of lack of any creativity in the script, you actually do not need any dialog to understand what's going on.

This way you will at least change this, otherwise painful and frustrating experience, of watching this, blend and poorly written slog into perhaps learning some new language skills.

It really looks like AI wrote it, and it got very little to work with. I think the AI have generated some show that was not meant to work in space and then they were like: okey now move it to Star Wars. Characters almost teleport scene to scene, not caring for the size of the galaxy. Fire just burns in space like it's nothing. If you switched the entire plot into, let's say, 90s action movie, it would just changed the scenery.

At this point, I am just amazed how bad it is. You need to do an actual effort to keep it that bad. There are hundreds of people working on this, and you choose to ignore all complaints. Just WOW.",1.0,8 June 2024
I'm shocked that Disney can be so bad,"First time reviewer here. I felt I had to do my part to let others know just how far Star Wars has fallen. My kid (6) was pumped for this show. We ordered Pizza and made a night of it. However, by halfway through the first episode, he was over it and wandering around the loungeroom looking for other entertainment. And to be fair, he did well to last as long as he did. This whole production was just strange. The acting was not that good. I felt the Asian Jedi master was believable - every other character felt like I was watching a highschool drama student. I also felt like I was being indoctrinated, not entertained. The effort by the creators to be inclusive and diverse was abundantly evident, to the point where it took away from the experience. The story so far too, has been incredibly predictable and underwhelming. I dont think I will even bother with the subsequent episodes.

For many fans, the recent trajectory of the Star Wars franchise under Kathleen Kennedy's leadership has been infuriating. The relentless push for a w0ke agenda, with talentless w0men in control at the expense of competent masterminds, is destroying the franchise.

However, what baffles me is the Clone Wars comparison. CW had wittiness, great acting, compelling storylines, it explored interesting and often difficult topics (such as PTSD, or the ethics of cloning, environmental impact of war, etc.) with respect, creativity and passion, and most of all, Clone Wars treated Star Wars with appreciation and fidelity to the original material. Contrary to CW, it is abundantly clear that the writers of The Acolyte have little to no knowledge of previous Star Wars writing, atmosphere and worldbuilding. If this show consciously tried to do something different, it was to its own detriment.

The original Star Wars trilogy, formerly marketed as the Star Wars Trilogy (and colloquially referred to as the 'original trilogy'), is the first set of three films produced in the Star Wars franchise, an American space opera created by George Lucas. It was produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by 20th Century Fox, and consists of Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). Beginning in medias res, the original trilogy serves as the second act of the nine-episode Skywalker Saga. It was followed by a prequel trilogy between 1999 and 2005, and a sequel trilogy between 2015 and 2019. Collectively, they are referred to as the ""Skywalker Saga"" to distinguish them from spin-off films set within the same universe.

I don't understand how this is the same company that produced Andor and rogue one. Feels like it could have been a high school fan project.

I'm done with Star Wars.,"I've been a Star Wars fan for about 30 years. Remember going to a trade show and bought all 3 of the original movies on vhs, showing my age here, when I was 15 years old. Loved those movies and though the prequels were a mixed bag I was excited that Star Wars was continuing on with the world I've grown to love.

The sequel trilogies were then announced back in 2012 and again I was excited. However that's when I realized that things would change and not for the better. Force awakens was a mix bag, the same story told in a new hope but ""updated for modern audiences"". But okay. Sure thing. Need to get the next generation caught up with the lore. I won't even get into the other two but that's when the cracks started to show. Loved rogue one. Solo not so much.

When it was announced Disney plus would be launched with new Star Wars content needless to say I was stoked. Stories outside the skywalker saga focusing on other characters from the galaxy far far away.

Mandalorian season 1 and 2 were great. Then the other crap came. Book of baba fett was promising but to me made absolutely no sense. Obi-wan played a secondary character in his own show. Should have been renamed Reva. Ahsoka was a prime example. Should have been rebels season 5 And the mandalorian season 3 was no different as he was a secondary character to Bo-Katan. I started noticing a pattern. Seems all the female characters are better and more skilled than the males to make them look good. There's no struggle. No character arc. No consequences. Nothing.

So now we move on to the acolyte. I had reservations about this show given the backlash it received before even airing. But like everything I won't judge it if I haven't seen it. So I gave it a shot.

I won't be watching this. I can honestly say I'm done with star wars.

The visual effects were cool. That's the only praise I'll give this dumpster fire in space of a show. And yeah. That's a thing now. Fire in space. Huh. Who knew?

They made this out to be a murder mystery. Well they got the murder right. But when the opening scene shows who did the murder than there's no mystery now is there?

The production people and actors attack fans because if they serve us crap on a plate and want us to call it steak than we're the bad people cause we just don't get it and have to adjust with the times.

Star Wars is an easy concept. Its wars in space. I watch this to be entertained not to be preached to.

I noticed they try to check off all the boxes for diversity. Not being cliche but put a woman in it and make her a girl boss where she's better than anyone else comes to mind. But another issue is with this is the actors marketing the show say its fans fault and there's a ""small group"" of trolls who try to influence others.

Seems like it MIGHT pan out to be decent. But the casting.. oh the casting is terribly poor in places. Almost as if they cast based on hairstyles and dancing ability (for fights), not actual acting skills.

Meh... its much better than most of the sci-fi out there. But it's not better than most of the other Star Wars spin-offs.

Episode 3 was pretty bad overall, then throw in the ""Oh viewer's won't notice"" aspects and it's just terrible. And the Jedi are pseudo ""overlords"" here????? Unsympathetic enforcers for The Republic? The Jedi??",2.0,6 June 2024
Terrible,,1.0,8 June 2024
What a Waste of Time,"Wow. This is not just bad. This is horribly bad. No logic. No stakes. What were they thinking? These so-called writers have no clue about Star Wars mythology and clearly have no clue about how to tell a compelling story. How do you destroy a brand as big as Star Wars? I guess, you just throw out all Star Wars canon and try to reinvent it. And, perhaps that could work if you just told an amazing story. But sadly, this is not an amazing story. It's actually, barely a story at all. Bring back the Star Wars canon and just tell me an exciting, edge of your seat story. The Acolyte is boring, dull and uninteresting created by folks who don't understand the basics of dramatic structure.",1.0,11 June 2024
When I Thought Disney Could Make A Worse Star Wars Show,,1.0,13 June 2024
Good Potential But Terrible Execution. Cringe Script.,"Started decent with a good fight scene. I like the idea of Samurai versus Ninja assassin. Dogmatic honor versus at all cost kill. But the ending of the fight was predictable and lame. Ruined what could have been a memorable first scene for the series. Bummer. The rest of episode 1 and all of episode 2 fell off a cliff after the first scene. Terrible writing. Poor editing.

Most of the lines were very cringe with dumb lines and awkward behavior. I probably palmed a hand to my forehead or put a finger gun to the side of my head a dozen times mocking the thoughtlessness in some of the writing. I get the Kill Bill homage. But the execution left me upchucking. It was just getting from A to B with weak plot contrivances. They should have asked Quentin Tarantino to fill the script with plausibility and a better how to get from A to B. And better editing that was not just exposition dumps and long pauses of awkwardness.

I found myself not wanting to waste anymore brain cells on this. I will give it one more episode to improve. Otherwise I'll spend my time on other content. I give this three stars for the first scene. And took a star away for the extreme stupidity and boredom. Nothing else worth mentioning for anymore positive points.",2.0,10 June 2024
It is better than Ahsoka but it certainly is no Andor,"Trying to give every new entry a fair try. The Acolyte (gauging by the first two epsiodes) is not disapointing as such, but sadly merely infantile and bland. If I need to shut of my brain and watch something to relax, this will do nicely. It however fails to engage me emotionaly or mentally, as it lacks substance and development.

What do I mean by infantile? That the plot is written so that a 4 year old chilk or a teen/adult incapable of putting their phone aside can follow it.

Every action is anounced overtly and repeatedly, in case you missed it the first time.

Bland as in it tries to be a ""This is what fans think is a Star Wars right?"" instead of being it's own within the Star Wars Universe. That were the strengths of the Prequels and the EU and Andor, having their own course and Identity. The Acolyte is generic.

By Comparison Andor, which took me convincing to watch after so much terrible dribble under current leadership, managed within two episodes, get me invested in the Ark of a Nobody, an upstart employee, an imperial intelligence agent and two tragic rebels.

In addition he Murder Mystery is spoiled within the first episode. The Jedi act needlesly dense and inflexible for the plot to be able to happen. The use of the Mystery Box for the master is blunt. The visuals a good, the sets are decent, the fight choreography is 1990 TV.

The Characters are OK. But just ok is not enough. By comparison with recent shows, the plot of the new Fallout show was rubbish but I stayed to the end as the Characters, for the most part, where intriguing.

Albeit the Plot of the Acolyte seems to be more sensible than Fallout's the infantility and blandness of its delivery paired with merely ok characters, leaves me with nothing to invest myself into. So why continue to watch yet another fetchquest plot (fetching the criminal on the run that is, as there is no crime to investigate).

The Acolyte suffers in the end from what most of Disney Star Wars suffers from: The Story is Paper thin. The audience is deemed comatose. The Characters are somewhere between cardboard cut outs and walking tropes. Disney and LucasFilm fail to realise again that the success of Star Wars was not that it was ""Space Wizards with Laser Swords"" for kids, but that it told tales of old myths in a new coating. And it is a shame. As a well told crime story could have been a great addition to the mythos.",3.0,5 June 2024
Oh dear. Gutted,"This should have been good. But it's not. Mainly because the script a few, not all of the actors are just plain awful /wooden. Delivery of lines seems like they are bored. Need to give it more time but it just doesn't feel right. It's a little too on the nose and trying to hard. Ep 2 picked up but it still felt very boring and I really don't care about any of it yet. The tv shows are feeling more and more like cosplay and not a lived in real universe. Clunky dialogue and essentially dull Jedi, not at all cool or likeable. One potential cool one lasts approx 3 mins. It's all to shiny and feels star treky.",4.0,6 June 2024
Bring back the realism,"For the first two episodes...

So thought I would brush aside the pre-hate for the show and see for myself what the latest Disney offering would bring for Star Wars fans.

The idea seems good in principle, with a murder mystery set in the SW universe pre-phantom menace.

The visuals are actually very good as is the cinematography on a whole.

The problem is that the characters seem paper-thin and unauthentic. I know, it's all fantasy anyway, but there was a higher sense of organic realism in the original trilogy that's never really been matched since.

The acrobatic, cartoonish, overly choreographed dance movies in the modern stuff always seems over the top to me.

Mark Hamill held the light sabre with both hands as if it was really heavy and this made you believe in the danger and power of the weapon. In the modern shows we're seeing dainty dancers twirling light-weight, glowing batons in the air. There's just no sense of danger.",3.0,6 June 2024
"Wanted to like it, just... not good in any way","Premise sounded interesting... production values are solid, so budget seems not to be the issue.

The storyline and dialogue are terrible, and the acting is only slightly better. New setting, premise, viewpoint... and zero worldbuilding occurs. You literally know nothing about any of the towns, worlds, or situation in the galaxy in the first 2 hours. All the scenes could have occurred in the same town and you wouldn't know the difference. The gimmick of the main character comes across like a made for TV hallmark movie for teens. Honestly might dislike this more than. Amazon's World of Time series, and that was a literal crimescene.

What would i have changed? Needed to be terribly darker and grittier. I was expecting poverty, lawlessness, suffering, corruption of political elite, institutional failure, social repression and upheaval. Bladerunner feel vs hallmark movie of the week. Humanizing characters so you feel a connection later.

Instead of complex storymaking, very shallow, the only details you have are superficial characters that to be quite honest, not particulalry likeable or interesting.",3.0,6 June 2024
High budget fan fic,"Apparently this show has a budget of $180 million, with that kind of budget you would expect them to be able to afford better writers and actors. Obi-wan kenobi was half that and had some real heart in there which makes this offering even more depressing. This is probably the worst of the disney star wars cash grabs to date and may be the best argument for switching to AI written scripts if this is the garbage the real writers spew out. If this wasn't star wars brand no one would care about it and that is the problem. Don't bother with this one or at least wait until it is fully released to see if they fix the tedium of the first couple of episodes. This is a real shame, they should just get the rights to all of the original star wars expanded universe and convert those into TV shows instead of leaving it to writers with no vision or possibly who never go outside and spend time with real people.

TLDR: Disney must be funneling the budget of this into anything but what we get to see on screen because this is terrible.",2.0,6 June 2024
Not a Star Wars story,"This doesn't even feel like a Star Wars story. It's just a murder mystery with weird characters with weird costumes from different planets. These Disney shows are getting worse and worse. I only really enjoyed Rogue One and The Mandalorian. Those had a purpose in the story line and had the Star Wars feel to them. I'm sure they make money on whether they're good or bad so why not keep making them, right? I'm sure there's enormous pressure on the studio to produce new shows and movies but this should not be one of them.

I was hoping it improves as the episodes are released but I gave up on this series. I can't watch anymore.",3.0,6 June 2024
Complete failure and falls on its face despite a massive budget,"Embarrassingly bad and it disrespects the essence of what Star Wars is. I'm generally not hard to please and have loved many Disney Star Wars shows and movies that others have not. (Ahsoka, Solo, Book of Boba Fett to name a few that I enjoyed) However this is disgustingly bad and feels more like a fan fic. The fact this show has the highest budget of any Star Wars project is astonishing because it completely falls flat. The dialogue is bad, even for Star Wars standards, and the acting does it no favors. The only saving grace of this show is Master Sol and his terrific actor. He is the only interesting character that holds any ounce of my attention at any given moment.",2.0,12 June 2024
I am impressed how bad these shows are,"After E3, I came back to lower my score even more.....so, yeah, congrats Disney.

I don't know if Disney does not care, gets a tax write off or just wants to kill Star Wars.

They just seem hell bent on making as many shows they can, so they can sell merch, get subscriptions or whatever and it's killing Star Wars.

Where to being with this show. I did not have high hopes, but even they were not met. They mess with law, what has gone before, terrible writing, women yay....men not so.

Fans have been screaming out what great stories Disney should taken on, but it seems to fall on deaf ears. It's almost like ""We hear what you say but.....we will try something no one has asked for""

Many years ago, I would have thought to make this many shows, would have been a fans dream, I mean how hard could it be, but we are left with average to poor shows and some fans desperate to convince themselves that it's good, or that as long as a few episodes are OK, that=good.

I am now at the point of sticking with the first 6 films and just forgot everything that followed.",2.0,6 June 2024
Feels like Star Trek with Star Wars sprinkles ✨,"The Good:

The score composed by Michael Abels is solid. Nothing majestic (like John Williams) or spectacular (like Kevin Kiner or Michael Giacchino), but it fits in the world of Star Wars. I appreciate the few editing choices and visual effects to make it feel like George Lucas' Star Wars. Dafne Keen looks cool, but doesn't have a lot to do.

The Bad:

Feels more like Star Trek than Star Wars. The Rashomon effect-style story is predictable. Not a lot of surprises, you can either see them coming or they were spoiled in the trailers. The Force-Fu fighting is not impressive, could've been better. Disney/Lucasfilm's hubris is in full display here. They still think they can redefine and make a better Star Wars than George Lucas' Star Wars.

The Ugly:

autism. where is logic???,"Everything illogical and autistic: -motive of the antagonist (she is to blame for everything) -how did 1 fire destroy an entire ""fortress"" -the situation where Yord pursues Osha to prove her innocence + other autistic scenes -why did they show an half naked yord???

-everything predictable

aside from that: -too little action -not enough Star Wars

The writers thought ""I'll make the world the way I like it"" and that's why they rewrote Star Wars facts.

I think the series was intended to appeal primarily to female hardcore fans; can this be?

Great YouTube Fan Film !!,"Honestly, that's what was going through my mind... It felt like I was watching a shoestring budget fan film made by cosplayers....and not the product of a BEHEMOTH of an entertainment company.

Part of this is props to TouTube cosplayers. Computer tech ology has given them the ability to make productions that are better than what big budget TV shows from the 80s. It's really incredible.

HOWEVER, that raises the bar for big entertainment companies, and instead of being the bleeding edge of SciFi, they have set their priorities on goals that do not include taking SciFi into the 21st Century.

These big American companies better watch out, because it is also apparent that foreign film makers have caught up in production quality.....but at a fraction of the production price tag. American entertainment companies are no longer the bleeding edge. The world has caught up as they took their eyes off the ball.",2.0,7 June 2024

Star Wars for people who dont like Star Wars,"The Acolyte struggles with many things, mainly a VERY cliche plot. Fight scenes have good choreography but so far in between that you lose interest and start to scroll your phone. The dialog is so clunky you might as well be watching a horribly rehearsed highschool play. Showrunners did not do this show any favors; alienating the vast majority of their fan base by including themes that Star Wars is not known for.

The acting is terrible and this new ""version"" of the jedi they created is not refined and lacks any sort wisdom and honor we grew up to idolize. They are desperately trying to make a show on the back of a massively successful franchise that is different yet speaks to new and old fans. It didnt work. I fear this show could kill what remains of the franchise for truly loyal fans. The days of Mando and Andor are long gone.

Leslye Headland has never created anything in her career other than activist documentaries and docuseries. Her only relevant qualifications to make this show, is that she was a fan, but a fair weather one at that. True Star Wars fan will not be impressed. This is show you put on in the background while you are vacuuming. Some thing to just play so you don't go insane. But you might anyway with the terrible dialog.",3.0,6 June 2024

This is Not Star Wars!,"Only two episodes in and there is no way this series can redeem itself. The producers and writers of this show clearly never grew up watching Star Wars and clearly enjoyed kung fu martial arts movies more. The casting is off, the script and dialogue is horrendous, the sets & costumes are cheap and, the characters lack character! This is a poor TV show using Star Wars branding to gain attraction..... How Disney can produce a true Star Wars Saga series like Andor but then throw mud like the Acolyte & Ashoka over this franchise is mind boggling.

The Disney Star Wars saga is showing continuous trends of poor story writing, dubious casting, cheap sets/costumes, abuse of Star Wars methodology and soundtracks which sound nothing like anything belonging to Star Wars. All of these abandoned production values are infuriating to genuine Star Wars enthusiasts.",2.0,9 June 2024
"The Acolyte, Episode 1, The Phanton Poopies","Hahaha!!! Cringe AF yall. Too to bottom. It's like going down a waterslide made of sandpaper. Absolutely the nerdiest thing ever. The thing that sets Star Wars apart from say, GI JOE or other kid's based products is that it was made by serious film makers and actors. They can say made up words like, metacloreans, and not make every adult turn it off to go back to watching Seinfeld reruns because it's so silly. That's why SW sold for 5 billion and GI Joe would sell for about 200 million. Universal human themes delivered by professionals so it has mass appeal. That's all over. The new writers write like children. The new directors direct like children. The undertones have no kick ass cool vibe. The actors feel like people who never liked SW but like the idea of being part of SW so now they're doing bad impressions of characters. Every line is written way too melodramatic and then the actors deliver them like they're hoping they'll be revered like Obi Wan Kenobe by the fan base. Well, whatever fan base they're going for in this. Young females if I were to guess and that won't work out of course because girls aren't dorks. Dudes are dorks and we stay dorks for life. Thats how SW has 60 year old male fans. Women usually grow out of being dorks. Thank god for that because we can't just have a whole planet full of nerds walking around. Anyhow, it's an unserious show trying to fool you into thinking it's serious about being good.",1.0,8 June 2024
Pretty forgetable,"I would really like to love 'The Acolyte,' but the script is as uninspired as it is marred by preemptive self-censorship and written tailored to transmit values specific to US societal issues. Creativity seems irrelevant, overshadowed by a forced agenda that degrades the essence of the Star Wars universe. The casting feels too young and not really believable, lacking chemistry and depth, making it hard to connect with the characters. They continue to prioritize messaging over storytelling and real science fiction. Instead of offering fresh perspectives and innovative narratives within the Star Wars lore, 'The Acolyte' disappoints with its lack of originality and engagement. It's a missed opportunity to delve into unique stories, ultimately falling short of its potential. I miss the times of true inspiration and understanding what made star wars once so great, the creative venture into a new fantastic universe and interesting truly diverse characters. The script seems to consist of the typical template blocks which infest most hollywood movies lately. Overall, a pretty forgetable experience. In a year from now I wont remember even the Title of the show I guess. Also, please fire a) your script writers b) the creative director c) a good chunk of the cast and replace them with mature believable characters and d) the entire executive layer of Disney.

Half a minute!,"The Acolyte. It's been a while since I've watched anything from the new world of Star Wars. Half a minute is as far as I got into this thing, before I gave up. I was there as a ten year old back in 1977, when the advert for THE first Star Wars film came out. I was in the cinema to watch Disney's 'Bed-nobs and Broomsticks' or whatever it was, which I do recall was being promoted as a special effects extravaganza at the time and ... to cut a short story short, I don't recall anything about 'Bed-nobs and Broomsticks'. I spent the entire run-time thinking about the Star Wars advert I'd just seen, which, by the way, as a ten year old, I knew nothing about beforehand. When I finally saw Star Wars, I was blown away, like everyone else at the time. Here we are 45ish years later and ... half a minute was all I could bear. What the hell happened? I'll give it a go. The original Star Wars film was gritty, rough, dirty, un-polished, novel, different, everything that is so wonderful about the film industry, when it gets it right - which absolutely reflected the whole Star Wars story premise etc. With these spin-offs the writers go straight in there with the filmic equivalent of a polished, blinded-up, gold-leaf 'smart-phone' gadget thing and just because their shallow minds are deeply impressed with such shiny rubbish, they think the rest of us will like it too. Wrong. The Acolyte! Half a minute. Try taking a look at what happened with the MCU 'stuff', coz the same's happening with this stuff. As a ... oldish man now, I'm reminded of what British Leyland did to the British car industry ... we need a 'Chopper' not a 'Shopper'. (By the way, I'm not at all happy about writing a review like this about something that has largely been so unbelievably excellent)",1.0,6 June 2024
feels unfinished and sloppy,"By now I was thinking that SW studio took lesson from sloppy sequel trilogy and it was looking they did when I watched Mandalorian, Andor or Tales of Jedi. Book of Boba Fett and Tales of Empires were little on the decline for my taste but still enjoyable. I cant really decide how to feel about Ahsoka.

Obi-wan was very weird but only because I still feel like they butchered Inquisitors with cheap cgi and costumes totally not holding to Clone Wars appearances.

Acolyte?

Story as in script look appealing and very decent. Something I wanted to see since I was a kid and saw prequels in cinema.

Story as in execution? Not so much. Lot of plot holes and characters not really being consistent and it was only two episodes so far.

It seems that show wants to do everything at once and fails in doing so. Same issues that sequels had. Half baked and inconsistent.

On the other hand I liked that writers didnt add any goofy force powers as they did in sequels. Kudos for that.

Compared to Rosario Dawson as Ahsoka, Mark Hammil as Luke, Carrie Fisher as Leia, Ewan McGregor as Obi-wan, ironically enough for Harrison Ford as Han Solo who admitted he hated the role and despite that owning the character now I had feeling like half of the main actors didnt really care and I had troubles to feel anything for their characters. They were simply not convincing enough for me.

Is it redeemable? No doubt. There is plenty of episodes left to make it decent show but so far its below average for me. Its not that as bad as people claim to be but its not great either. Its bad in its own way.",3.0,8 June 2024

"A Missed Opportunity in a Galaxy Far, Far Away","I had high hopes for ""The Acolyte,"" expecting it to bring a fresh and intriguing perspective to the Star Wars universe. Unfortunately, the show falls disappointingly short of its potential. Despite a promising premise, it is bogged down by a series of missteps that make it difficult to recommend.

Firstly, the pacing of the show is painfully slow. The narrative drags on, making it a challenge to stay engaged. Key plot points are often obscured by unnecessarily long and meandering scenes that add little to the overall story. It feels as though the writers are stalling for time rather than advancing the plot in a meaningful way.

The characters, another crucial aspect of any Star Wars story, are surprisingly one-dimensional. The protagonist, who should be complex and compelling, comes across as bland and unrelatable. The supporting cast is similarly underdeveloped, with their motivations and backstories either poorly explained or entirely absent. As a result, it's hard to care about their fates or feel invested in their journeys.

Moreover, the dialogue is often clunky and stilted, lacking the wit and charm that fans of the franchise have come to expect. There are moments where the script feels almost amateurish, with characters delivering lines that are unintentionally laughable.

The show also suffers from inconsistent special effects. While some scenes are visually stunning, others are marred by subpar CGI that detracts from the immersive experience. Given the high standards set by previous Star Wars installments, this inconsistency is particularly jarring.

One of the biggest letdowns is the way the show handles its connection to the broader Star Wars lore. Instead of enriching the universe, ""The Acolyte"" often feels disconnected from the established canon, introducing elements that contradict or undermine previous stories. This not only frustrates long-time fans but also creates a disjointed viewing experience.

In conclusion, ""The Acolyte"" is a frustrating watch. Its sluggish pacing, underdeveloped characters, clumsy dialogue, inconsistent visuals, and tenuous connection to the Star Wars lore result in a show that fails to live up to its potential. For a series that promised to delve into the darker side of the Force, it instead leaves viewers feeling left in the dark about what could have been an exciting new chapter in the Star Wars saga.",1.0,7 June 2024

The acting is mostly average to bad, the costumes and sets look cheap and small, and the story and writing are terrible. The characters are boring and nearly nothing makes sense.

RIP Star Wars,"Where do I begin? What a snooze fest! I was bored! Initially I didn't have a lot of interest in this project, but the critics reviews were overwhelmingly positive. What am I missing? The acting was wooden. The dialogue was atrocious. Editing was weak. I didn't care about the story or the characters. They killed off the best character in the first episode. I can't believe that Disney spent $180 million dollars on this project when they could have given that budget to the Kenobi or Ashoka. Who's in charge over there? I won't be watching the next episodes. By the way, with the exception of TROS, I enjoyed most of Disney SW. I also loved Indiana Jones Dial of Destiny.

Another Bad Attempt,"The story makes no sense. There seems to be a tide of social concepts that are trying to do something here, but this doesn't work. I wish the Star Wars spin-offs that work like Andor and The Mandalorian would focus on making more episodes and forget these new wannabes.

The space scenes look okay in this show but add nothing to the story. The title of the show even seems forced. I wish someone would try to further the story from the end of the Star Wars movies but most seem to think going to the past or adding something in between will work.

$180 million for 8 episodes that are 30 mins long... solid 3/10,"Honestly,

This is would have 4-5/10 if it did not take 4 years and spent 180 million for 8 episodes (22.5 mil/episode) each 30 mins long roughly.

To give you context, GoT was 10 million per episode (season 6), fallout 19 million per episode, Dune 2 190 million budget.

This show has great visual production, costume, and scenes. It is great to seen minority groups and LGBTQIA2+ community being represented.

What this show lacks is creativity, writing/themes, acting (both leads and supporting), and directing. I have watched the first 3 episodes and the story is so tangled it becomes hard to track what is happening.

Unfortunate Disney spent 180 million to produce this, I cannot see the return in value. Maybe Disney gives this season 2, but I cannot see them renewing it past season 2 unless another direction is taken.

Looking forward to watching the rest of the season, hopefully it does improve.",3.0,13 June 2024
"""Disappointing and Uninspired - The Acolyte Misses the Mark""","As a die-hard Star Wars fan, I had high hopes for ""The Acolyte,"" but unfortunately, it turned out to be the worst show I have ever witnessed. The acting felt forced and out of order, lacking the depth and authenticity that fans have come to expect from the Star Wars universe. It seemed like the characters were pushed into situations without proper development, leaving the audience disconnected and unengaged.

The fire scenes were particularly cringe-worthy, looking as if an amateur had hastily written the script without considering the impact on the overall story. The lack of nuance and subtlety in the storytelling made it difficult to invest in the characters and their journey.

All I can hope for is a return to the visionary storytelling of George Lucas and his team, who understood the essence of Star Wars and brought it to life with passion and creativity. Disney, please stop destroying the legacy of Star Wars with lackluster productions like ""The Acolyte."" Bring back the magic and wonder that made this franchise a beloved cultural phenomenon.

This is in the end of the high Republic and the star wars universe is endless and they chose this? I repeat it's star wars. More flying. More lasers. More droids. More lightsabers. More jedi. More sith. Less conspiracy theories and less senate politics.

And what the flips did they do to the Jedi Temple?

Believe me i will watch the whole series. But mostly to get the links to evt. Future shows about this and that.

I scored it a 3 star. Wasn't full on there.",3.0,5 June 2024
Very disappointed,"Pros: breathtaking scenery (the only reason I'm giving any stars)

Cons: -horrendous acting -Classic female protagonist where her difficult past is described and not shown -the plot which is explained in episode 2 is underwhelming considering the 180M dollar budget -simple technical issues such as: an open flame roaring in space where no oxygen is present, crash landing on a ship and presumably flying out of her seat (she wakes up on the ground after the crash, and not strapped into her seat before the crash) with absolutely ZERO signs of any injuries, the main Jedi who thought Anakin blew up the death star ignites his lightsaber unnecessarily way too much, etc. The list goes on and there has only been 60 minutes of content released so far.

-so far there's no real reason to care for any of the characters despite how bad this show wants you to.

I was a big fan of Star wars though. It's disheartening seeing Star wars go so far downhill that by the time we get a sith focused story, it's ruined by lack of decent acting, a messy and underwhelming/clichè and at times, just downright cringy decisions. For instance, the first fight in episode one. Lightsabers (according to past Disney star wars movies and TV shows) don't actually kill anyone, however throwing knives from acolyte do. The choreography was slow and you could feel that they were holding back to avoid hurting each other which led to a slow and cringy fight that the music was trying to dictate as ""serious"". (I quite literally couldn't stop laughing). The fact alone that the Jedi felt she needed to put out her lightsaber to defend herself against throwing knives, when she demonstrates several times that she is a skilled force user, is laughable. I was excited to see the lightsabers, but it felt wrong seeing the first ignition.

My last and biggest gripe with this show so far, is that it feels like a rehearsed play. Almost like they are saying their lines to each other for the first time in full set and costume. They hired a writer who has literally never seen ANYTHING star wars or star wars related (she mentioned Chewbacca as a dog) and it shows.

I don't know where the 180M dollar budget went, however I can say for sure that it wasn't spent making content by star wars fans, for star wars fans.",1.0,6 June 2024

Stop destroying Star Wars,"This is not Star Wars anymore. It's Disney slop, made to carry an ideological message that makes no sense and people are tired hearing about. The people who are making this don't know what they're doing and are hiding behind their activism, to justify making this. They stripped it of everything that made Star Wars Star Wars and turned it into Generic Sci-Fi Series no. 739™. The best way I can describe this series, is a nothing burger covered in Star Wars paint, but this paint is already coming off, because it does not feel like Star Wars at all. And the saddest part is, that this could've been a Force Unleashed movie or anything else from the already established EU, but instead they decided to blow $180 million to make whatever this is supposed to be.",1.0,5 June 2024
Acolyte: A Disappointing Misfire,"As a fan of the genre, I was eagerly anticipating Acolyte, but it turned out to be a major letdown. From the very first episode, it was clear that this show was more style than substance. The plot meandered aimlessly, with convoluted storylines that went nowhere and characters that failed to resonate.

The writing was shallow and predictable, relying heavily on tired tropes and clichés. Any attempts at building tension or intrigue fell flat, as the pacing was inconsistent and the plot twists were telegraphed from miles away.

To make matters worse, the acting was wooden and unconvincing. It felt like the cast was going through the motions, with little passion or energy behind their performances. I found it impossible to invest in any of the characters or their struggles.

Overall, Acolyte feels like a wasted opportunity. With so much potential to explore complex themes and engaging narratives, it's a shame to see it squandered on such uninspired storytelling. Save yourself the disappointment and give this one a hard pass.",1.0,7 June 2024
below average effort,"Firstly, This show doesn't deserve 0 or 1 star. This is the rating people give it who are angry at the Disneyfication of Star Wars and not really fair.. THis show has reasonably high production values and it's not incoherent. However it plays like a young adult tv show, it's not immersive and the 'mystery' isn't compelling.

I understand that Disney wanted this show to stand out for its diversity and to undermine some traditional star wars assumptions. But that just isn't interesting or original for most people and the show really needs more.

In my mind, Star Wars hasn't worked without George Lucas. The mandalorian was ok early on, Rogue One was quite good and Stellan Skarsgard made Andor good. But all the rest has been basic, formulaic 'product' and the magic of the brand can no longer carry it.",4.0,10 June 2024

Nothing in it.,"Lots of hate around here. Then again I'm also not new to Disney ruining everything they touch. Let me be straight, Andor was the only show I liked (mostly), and the rest were quite bad. But I still watched the first episode this just in case.

My initial thoughts were ""What is this a soap opera? Who wrote this script? Dude, why are you just standing there reading lines? At least do your job and act. Why is the speech out of sync with your mouth, CGI alien?"" And then I kept watching and it didn't get much better.

I get why all the hate is here. This snow isn't good, and it's not bad, it's just nothing. The characters? Soulless puppets, The plot? Can't really say after one episode but so far there is none. Can't even remember anything related to score, and I finished episode 1 like 10 minutes ago. The Actors? Felt like they picked random people off the street. I've seen better extras. The only thing that's decent is the CGI.

Will I watch episode 2? Probably, but just because I've got nothing better to do at this moment.",4.0,6 June 2024
The Acolytes Delusions of Grandeur,"Disney should have hired Mark Hamill to write and direct the last trilogy and these series. How they missed the ""MARK."" All puns intended! Listening to his interviews he knew the way the Star Wars universe should have been carried on. Instead, he had to bite his tongue and roll with the punches, while subtly trying to warn the fans.

I now get more entertainment at reading and watching the bad reviews than watching any Disney Star Wars product. The over abundance of pandering at the cost of good acting, the flat out horrible screen writing, and lack of attention to common sense details is so tiresome. You'd think they'd figure it out by now! Just pure greed and Hollyweird nepotism at this point. The only way to make a change is to vote with your dollars! Cancelled Disney plus subscription and sold my DIS stock, which was my longest holding.

After this series flops and it will, think there will be a breaking point. Those who think it's a quality show and giving it high ratings are Disneys real hive-minded acolytes, the irony.",1.0,11 June 2024
Mediocre Storytelling (Only review you need to read) NO SPOILER,"A good show, regardless of what genre, needs a kick ass first episode. Something that sucks the viewer in and gives them the feeling ""I need to know more"" (Tv series such as ""Dark"", ""Breacking Bad"" or ""The Boys""). The Acolyte fails to do this.

The first scene was so confusing and weird, a failed attempt to make a cool scene and it just made me ask all the wrong questions. The dialogue is pretty basic, the story is very one-dimensional and too rushed. We barely get to understand our ""main cast"" while the first plotline is almost finished. It felt more like a chore to finish an episode rather than enjoy it.

As advertised this series is very diverse and inclusive, however SO FAR, in my opinion, it's correctly implemented and it hasn't been forced or held up against my face.

I like well written characters, no matter what Gender, race or sexuality. So far no characters stand out with great performances, there are one or two characters I like more than others and are enjoyable to watch, while other characters are very predictable and show little to no depth.

Conclusion: Should you watch it?

If you are a Star Wars fan, I'd stay away from it.

If you are someone who likes interesting, unique and thrilling stories, then this is definitely not for you.

If you are someone who likes action, the fights aren't bad, but nothing special.

Only if you are someone who really cares about having a story with diverse and inclusive cast, then this series will go your way, however I would recommend other diverse series such as ""Sandman"" which has actually good characters and a very well written plot.

-> I would not recommend ""The Acolyte""",3.0,6 June 2024
One of the star wars shows ever made,"Oh boy another absolute ""excellent"" show from good old mouse man glad they put a lot of thought into this show , the ""plot"" consists of I is strong women and I will fight strong waman,

don't get me wrong I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I pray every day that the next money grab from Disney will actually be good but this is just another example in a long line of examples that whatever their current motto is DOESNT WORK,

"Promising Premise, Terrible Script Full of Headscratching Eyerolling moments","The first 5 minutes with Carrie-Ann Moss had good moments. I like the Ninja vs. Samurai concept. Some good sequences in the fight. I was excited. But how the fight ended was extremely lame. Very predictable while being less believable. Very reminiscent of the worst imported Kung-fu movies from the 80s I use to watch with poor English overdubs. Laughable and entertaining for that genre but in a Star Wars TV series it comes off cheap and lazy. Come on, this is the first scene of the whole series. Great starting premise. But gives us a worthy ending. Everything after that first fight scene dropped off the cliff in quality. The rest of episode 1 and all of episode 2 full of terrible lines and scripting that had my eyes rolling to the back of my head. I think I slapped my forehead or put a finger gun to the side of my head a dozen times during the rest of episode 1 and 2. I get it, it's a homage to Kill Bill. But the way people act doesn't make sense. The production should have gotten Quentin Tarantino to help fill in the script with the how. This just goes from A to B. Don't think about it no matter how dumb or convenient even by space opera standards. There was promise in the outline of the plot. The execution was laughable and disappointing. To the point it is almost too cringe to continue watching. I will give it one more chance and watch the next episode. But it has to get better than this or I'm bailing on the series.

My kids were so disappointed.,"""Acolyte: A Disappointing Addition to the Star Wars Universe

The highly anticipated Star Wars series ""Acolyte"" fails to live up to the hype and falls short of providing a compelling new chapter in the iconic franchise. Set 100 years before the events of the Skywalker saga, the series had the potential to explore uncharted territory and introduce fresh perspectives. Unfortunately, the show stumbles at nearly every turn.

The plot is convoluted and meandering, lacking the clear narrative drive that makes the best Star Wars stories so engaging. The protagonists are one-dimensional and fail to generate any real emotional investment from the audience. The worldbuilding, while occasionally visually striking, feels derivative and uninspired, recycling familiar elements without adding anything new or meaningful.

Worse still, the series squanders the rich potential of the High Republic era, reducing it to a mere backdrop rather than using it as a springboard for innovation. Fans hoping for an in-depth exploration of this pivotal period in the Jedi Order's history will be sorely disappointed.

Even the action sequences, typically a strong suit of Star Wars, fall flat, feeling repetitive and lacking the visceral excitement that has defined the franchise's best fight scenes.

Overall, ""Acolyte"" is a missed opportunity, a frustratingly bland and forgettable addition to the Star Wars canon. For die-hard fans, it may be worth a watch out of sheer curiosity, but for most viewers, this series is simply not worth the investment of time and energy. A disappointing letdown that fails to capture the magic of a galaxy far, far away.""",2.0,7 June 2024
It's like a show for children,"This is my first review on IMDb, I'm just so disappointed with this show. It feels like I'm watching something from the Disney channel in the 90s, they've made jokes of some of the characters and the dialogue is awful. I've enjoyed a lot of Disney era star wars show and I even got on board with obi wan despite some terrible acting and casting decisions for the inquisitors, but at least it still felt like a star wars show.

This is just a cheap second rate teen show with lightsabers and it's really annoying because exploring this part of the star wars universe has the potential to be immense. I feel sorry for some of the actors in this who are doing a decent job in spite of the script and direction, but I'll be honest they seem in the minority for me.

A shame as I had high hopes and was trying to ignore the non canon changes and the plot holes. I was particularly disappointed in the first fight scene and the lack of Yoda, given where this could be set in comparison to his timeline.

The first fight scene felt like a parody, I half expected it to turn out to be a staged fight or a theatre performance in the script.

Hopefully it will improve but I have to say that at the moment I'm not hopeful.

Beyond disappointing,"First off, I have zero issues with any of the actors in this series. I blame the writers and producers for the shortcomings in ""The Acolyte."" For a series that has such a huge budget, it is amazing that old sci-fi shows like Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers, Star Trek Next Generation, and even Empire and Return of the Jedi look better than this.

The writers seemingly have zero ability to write a compelling narrative or a consistent character. It's HORRIBLE. This is supposed to be, according to the show runner, a murder mystery. There is no mystery. The horrendous writing destroys anything that could be good with this series. Hollywood in general has devolved into telling people things that they should be showing people. Are all their writers recent college students? Do they have any life experience at all? Characters don't act in rational ways, they don't even act in a manner consistent with their character.

It's always apparent when the writers are not familiar with the source material. Taunting a Jedi master to ""attack me with all your power"" demonstrates an almost laughable premise. No Jedi master EVER has attacked anyone in an unprovoked manner. The line may as well have been, ""come at me bro, come on!"" This isn't the actor's fault, this is a writing problem. I think the actors do a great job considering the script they've been given, but they've been given trash. Save your time and watch something else.

Maybe everyone will get non-great value outfits because currently they would not get a second look at a comicon/cosplay event.

Picking on costumes and bad CGI isn't really all that nice, I would 100% believe that those who worked on it did as much as they could with what they had to work with. That is just why I wonder if they were given nothing.

It is tough to fall into the trap that many shows are, sometimes rightfully, crucified for being agenda driven but this one feels a bit heavy handed simply because there was not much else to enjoy. I would say It is almost impossible to make a show that just focuses on nothing controversial, you would get no conflict, but the actual art of direction should be to make it woven seamlessly into a story.

As for me, I watched the first two episodes and was left kinda of in the middle. The kung fu video just feels weird to have in Star Wars. And the wire work of one person early on in Episode 1 looked goofy, more meant for Hong Kong cinemas then Star Wars.

Getting past that, some of the lines felt way to cheesy or like they were written by a kid. I guess I'm saying it was bad writing. Story wise its nothing to deep and seems like every other story we seen before. Jedi/Sith yadda yadda. Yes there is a some twists in this happening but it all felt bland.

There is also an issue with them repeating the same dialogue over and over and over in various scenes. Like REALLY drilling home some things going on, as if the audience didn't get it the first few times. I kinda of looked away a few times because I was getting bored.

Unlike something like Andor, which was mostly talking, but felt deep, you felt connected and involved.

The Force Is Nowhere Near This One,"Tell me you don't know anything about Star Wars without telling me you don't know anything about Star Wars. Harvey's assistant took that challenge to heart and delivered.

If you write an original IP, you are God. You are the Creator of the universe, you decide what goes and what doesn't. If you want up to be down and down to be up, so it shall be. If the color blue is called green, so it is. If you want things to happen out of thin air and then explain it with some BS magic, you can do that to. It's entirely up to you. Who people are? What do they look like? How do they function? What can they do? What can't they do? All of that is entirely up to you.

But here's the thing. Even as a wannabe writer who hasn't published anything, I've come to understand that while I'm the one who decides what goes and what doesn't go in the universes I create, there still have to be rules. The universe you build has to have a ground level, some semblance of a thread that holds it all together. The simplest example, gravity. What goes up, must come down. And that applies to everything you write in this universe. From the moment you agree to that rule, everything has to follow it. It may not be crucial to the story, but the story is still affected by it.

When you walk into an existing IP you have a catalogue of stories that were written before you dipped your pinky into it. Those are full of your ground rules. You write your story and then compare notes, have I messed something up, have I missed a rule that somehow breaks the universe. If the answer is yes, fix it. Use the rules as guidelines, find a workaround, take a different approach. It may seem like it's impossible, but it's really not. You are free to write what ever stories you want, you are not hindered, you just have to navigate the existing rules. That can be fun in and of itself, learning about the universe as you explore it. But that also means you have to know the rules, you have to know the universe, and you have to respect the franchise.

No one on Acolyte knows the universe. No one respects the franchise.

I wont be watching this and neither should you. Better off watching Andor again or something good as of late like Shogun.

Its the same disney plot,Its the same formula as the last 8-10 years of crap from disney. Strong lead female that no one can relate to because its no one acts like that and if they do no one likes them. Theres probably a ditzy male who cant tie his shoes without asking her for help and blah bla blah bla blah. Its just getting old and people are turning it off because first women dont aspire to be like that and men especially married men with children dont want their children imitating how people treat men. Like i said its lazy stereotypical writing from the same people who brought you Wish. Kathleen kennedy needs to do us all a favor and leave Disney.,5.0,5 June 2024
This is what happens,"This is what happens when you put a female director in a male dominant film. Complete failure!!! I knew this would happen when she said that she would ""make men extremely uncomfortable"". What is that? Disney needs to understand their priorities towards hard core Star War fans. Just purchasing the licence from Lucas does not give you the right to mess around with millions of fans. I understand that Disney has an obligation towards their investors. But this is not the way. There are hundreds of brands that have been around for many decades because they stay loyal to their loyalists.

TV-14,"This is not the way.

Star Wars is now being made for the 9-15 age group. No grit!

Give me an r rated Star Wars please!

I was do excited for a new story. I had HOPE.

Now we just get a show with a Star Wars setting. This story could be a Netflix show. Bad writing. Mediocre acting and not much to make a fan yearn for more.

Carrie Ann moss: trailers and key art used her likeness to promote the show. Is her character gone for good? What a waste.

And the e Jedi??! These two look like they were plucked from the Elves of the Lord of the rings.

This show poses as Star Wars but feels like a Saturday morning kids cereal carton.",3.0,6 June 2024
"SW:TV always feels like ""this could easily be way better""","I think the problem with SW:TV is the writers always feel pressured to make something so clever, it gets in its own way a lot. Many characters have potential huge moments but it doesn't get explored to hide some ""big secret"". My first example: Carrie Ann Moss vs Bad Twin. I feel like nearly none of the possible Kung Fu tropes were used which could have been entertaining were employed. When Bad Twin punches CAM's friends where is the part where CAM sweeps her robe up and shouts indignantly ""what is this insolence??"" Where is the super zoom into Bad Twins face saying ""I am the assassin here to murder you for your CRIME!"" The entire fight should have been twice as long and as it said in The Matrix ""you know a person by how they fight"". Bad Twin is dirty and raw, CAM is initially defensive and honorable. They should have had a lot more dialogue explaining what the crime supposedly is, and have CAM say ""your kung fu is worthy, who is your SIFU?"" I mean come on you need a line like that its a kung fu movie!

Also show us what is so cool about mixing Jedi and Kung Fu. Maybe get to a part where Carrie's character gets super angry and outraged, she can't believe Bad Twin is able to get some shots on her and hurting her friends so now she goes into attack mode, force pushes herself to jump kick which gets blocked but she levitates and rains down blows blooding Bad Twin a lot. During the fight they talk to each other and slowly reveal a lot about the overarching plot through many punches and kicks. Give Carrie some last words not just slump over. If writers decided she did nothing, let Carrie say ""I swear, I did not murder ... that man"" then have some Asian style music as Bad Twin has a doubt about what she is doing.

This is really what people are complaining about. You add female characters but they never get visibly hurt or damaged except for maybe a bloodless death! Its not that they are strong its that they have no flaws.

My second and final point, is about the second Jedi, they should have went all in and literally showed the crime the Jedi actually did.

Then we have one possibly fake untrue crime and one true crime keeping us on our toes. Say the writers go crazy and the Jedi is confirmed to having sexually abused younglings. Which they would sort of show, the Jedi disrobing a boy briefly, this makes the Star Wars Universe feel so raw and so real because their problems are also our problems. So now you root for Bad Twin to kill this Jedi. Now you want her to figure out the puzzle on how to kill him. Thereby going on an emotional rollercoaster not knowing exactly what to feel maybe being on Team Bad Twin. They forgot to allow us to root for Bad Twin.

There could be other bad Jedi in future episodes as well. One Jedi uses her power to get rich by dealing Spice to Hutts, prostitution or something, its interesting seeing how Bad Twin kills each Jedi with no weapons. The fourth and final criminal Jedi is Our Hero and his crime will shock you and bring such a richness to the character you love him anyway.

The show would have been so interesting, if it showed a Jedi Order in decay, criminality, and temptation through power eating away at peoples ethics and souls. The Sith isn't all bad, its a reaction to Jedi corruption. When being overly passive and apathetic brings disorder, the exact opposite reaction is The Sith and also brings its own evils.

I don't see that in this show, therefore the point of the show is too muddled in ""secrets and mystery"" for us to really enjoy it. We don't see the point in the narrative and this causes it to be boring. The dialogue is too afraid to be funny or interesting so as to reveal too much. Good writing would be to give us funny, interesting, dark and unpalatable character decisions, along with mysteries under the surface. Make us feel emotions and the viewer will be enraptured.

Its easy to make Star Wars cool, if you make what you knew before and add things to the delicious dish such as Kung Fu and raw criminal activities that need to be investigated, you only enhance what Star Wars is. So far, this task is a failure but in the right hands with just some care and understanding of basic tropes, would be an excellent show for fans and newbies alike. That is why we get more frustrated with Star Wars than any other series, its this sickening feeling of why doesn't anyone care to rewrite this one time to make it all worth it and worth 180 million dollars. Its senseless and so we cry out in exasperation once more with another Star Wars project.",4.0,8 June 2024
Very poor,"I gave it a 1 for production values The rest is hot garbage in all honesty.

Massive plot holes just in the first part of the first episode.

Inconsistencies all the time. Example - 'A Jedi only draws their light saber to kill', a bit later on - pulls out light saber to use it as a torch.

Unnecessary exposition, constantly treating the audience like idiots.

A fight sequence that flies in the face of everything we know about the Jedi i.e. A high ranking Jedi Master who can't use a force push to deal with a couple of daggers?

A fire in a vacuum?

An investigation that manages to not investigate whilst abandoning all logic and reason and arrests someone on the basis of one eye witness. Eye witnesses get things wrong all the time. Questioned yes, investigated yes, arrested No. A cursory glance at the ships log and journey times would have made innocence obvious but the laughable plot required an arrest so an arrest we got.

The ship crash that the protagonist wakes up from with not a mark on her or a hair out of place - except that the ship would have been effectively a pile of dust having hit the planet like a meteor (out of control rock basically) - it would have caused a crater and massive destruction and no one would have survived.

And it basically continues in that vein in part 2. I have heard part 3 is going to be worse - and I believe it on the basis on what I have already seen. I won't inflict on it on myself.

Mostly the acting was wooden and stiff, might not be the fault of the actors, poor direction and bad writing are most probably the culprit. Appalling dialogue full of clichés and tropes. It was dull, uninspired, and tedious for the most part. Little of it fitted into the Star Wars Universe. Jedi Masters who clearly had no clue what the force even was, due to the writers and director not having a clue.

The end result was devoid of any humanity or feeling.

This show clearly does not understand the universe or the lore and thinks its fine to mangle both beyond recognition.

Still treading downward,Amazing to think that we used to complain about Episodes 1-3...we never knew how good we had it until it was too late. Another bummer addition to a saga with forgettable characters and eye rolling dialogue. I really wonder if we will get a good new installment into this universe but even Ashoka was just ok. The marvel universe after the infinity saga has become just as loathe some as star wars had which is disappointing because I used to defend these types films and show's when people would ask if we needed another one.

Who wrote this?,"Being a lifelong fan I've absolutely loved every single Star Wars series that Disney have thrown at us since the acquisition of the Star Wars brand, so going into this with high expectations was a given.

First things first, the look of it all, sound design, cinematography etc are all absolutely exemplary. Each scene looks stunning, the outfits, practical effects, and CGI are all first rate, I honestly cannot pick a single fault.

So what's with the low rating?... Well, it just all feels a bit off, the casting, the writing, the character development. It's all very amateur. Almost like someone had been set a high school assignment to write a screenplay for a Star Wars story, and ended up using ChatGPT to do it. Damn it's awful. Some of the dialogue almost feels forced, I just cannot take it seriously.

Then there's the casting and characters themselves. The majority are just so unlikable, or better yet forgettable. With the exception of Indara and Sol, I cannot stand the rest. With Yord being possibly one of my least favourite Star Wars characters ever to grace our screens. And Mae being the most unconvincing Jedi Killer since that clone trooper took out Plo Koon during order 66.

When Disney announced they were to be telling a new story set during the high republic era which will be a dark tale of Jedis being murdered, this is a million miles away from what was expected. So disappointing.",3.0,8 June 2024

Honestly I've seen better and more lively performances at my children's elementary school plays. It seemed like the actors slept walked through their lines or were heavily medicated.

Ah, the writing... did they use Chat GPT to attempt to come up with this mess of a script? Dull, lifeless and boring, chewing on styrofoam for 60 minutes would be more enjoyable than sitting through another episode of this steaming pile of llama dung.

I've realised the problem!,"The thing about Star Wars is that it was made with a teenage mind for adults - that was basically George Lucas at that time. As it developed, especially after the first three series, And became so famous, and made so much money, George Lucas tried to hone in on Teenage fantasies, but leaving behind the adults who made it famous in the first place when they went to see the original film.

Now, the films and series are being made by adults, trying to think And imagine everything as a teenager, Therefore, missing the point of the original series. You make it for ""adults"" - not children or teenagers. When you do that, they will automatically tag along, so you have nothing to loose.

It's mind-boggling that The studios have not realised this. And, it's mind-boggling that George Lucas went down that rabbit hole by making up silly childish aliens and storylines that become too unfathomable!

They really need to get a grip! Go back to who the first film was made for, and then you can really hit home again!!",5.0,10 June 2024
Very Mid,"Based on two episodes so far.

Aggressively mediocre show with no highlights. As a spoiler-free fictional example: a character wants to make tea. Then you see them going through the motions. You may not know what they're doing next episode, but you always know the next few minutes, as the water starts to boil. There were a few deviations, but ultimately, they were just temporary distractions or setbacks. Characters set out to do the thing, then they do the thing. That made it feel somewhat boring to me, even though it is not slow paced per se. There are elements of adventure, and mystery, which were at the core of Star Wars, but the predictability here stops every momentum or intrigue and the characters are decidedly bland.

As before in Disney Star Wars, characters are mostly boring. Everyone is stoic, and the evil characters have perhaps pent-up anger issues. Nobody is cocky, nobody is witty, nobody is wise, nobody is exuberant. They're all very mid, emotionally reserved, grey characters, without any edges. They find it important to show the young Jedi guy shirtless, which also signifies the intended target audience. This is no longer Star Wars, for a variety of reasons.

The setting is entirely irrelevant (again). You can take pretty much any scene and have it take place somewhere else, and it wouldn't change anything. Needless to say, you cannot expect main Disney to actually expand the setting as Lucas' did seemingly effortlessly. There are no new things like trash compactors, turbolifts, cloud cities, walkers etc. That used to keep Star Wars exciting with each instalment. Andor and Rogue One are notable exceptions.

Occasionally, there are good alien designs (also rare under Disney) that felt properly Star Wars-that specific mix of animalistic, gnarly or creepy and grotesque. However, the aliens of importance default again to being Star Trek aliens afflicted by the Roddenberry Gene. It's an unfortunate trend Lucas himself started in the prequels, and that is now an excuse to make every Jedi alien look like a cosplayer in cheap costume and makeup. Aliens are anyway somewhat rare to make room for more ""diverse"" human characters.

Even though the streaming format should be the golden age of serial adventure blended with larger story arcs (as in Star Wars, original trilogy), Disney still hasn't figured it out. What remains is a very middle show you can skip, or watch in the background.",5.0,6 June 2024

Hiring writers who don't know Star Wars wasn't a good idea,"This review is from when only Episode 1 & 2 are available.

Going by the pre-release press and attacking the fans I was expecting this to be terrible. What we got was a totally mid experience all around.

Writing was boring and predictable, but serviceable.

Acting was ok in some parts (Amandla Stenberg and Jung-jae Lee were ok to good), but Charlie Barnette was awful, not sure why he is even there.

Plot is extremely predictable and they do a reveal of the bad person in the first episode instead of keeping it a mystery which would have been decent story telling.

Carrie-Ann Moss was wasted in her role. And the fight was totally unbelievable.

The fire in space was just a comment on how poor our education system is that nobody who saw that thought about how dumb it was.

The worst part is they ignore tons of lore about Jedi and how they work. There is no way the plot can work as presented if the writers know how the force works from the other movies or books. The writers obviously have not consumed much Starwars content.

Fights are decent, graphics are good, set design is a little sterile (like all recent Disney projects - everything too perfect), costumes not bad. Sol's actor seems grounded. First ep 4.5/10

Second episode - better by half! Decent pacing plot-wise, some twists and it's interesting yet slightly predictable... Could go either way!

"Its not bad, but its not good.","It is, MEH.

The story is lackluster, slow and predictable. The acting is flat and lacks emotion. The characters have surface level of depth and interest.

Therefore, it must be the toxic fanbase. It must be the male fans, who won't accept change. It can't be any other reason, other than the fans.

Or, perhaps its that Star Wars, at its core, has always been about a good story. Special effects were good, but the story is what carried it all. Add depth and development to the characters, and this is why it worked.

Nope, must be the toxic fanbase. Not the fact that this series is slow, tries to be action packed, when the action is flat, and does little to make the characters interesting in the least. After two episodes, what are their names again?

This story had a wonderful opportunity to set the time and place a long before all the known characters, and present us a time/space that was unique all to itself. So far, it doesn't do that. Its just someone killing someone, and an investigation and cat and mouse chase....oh wait a second. That's nearly every Star Wars TV Series so far, and a story cliché done over and over again.

To be clear, toxic fanbase talk is nonsense. Give us a good story, with good characters, and you'll get a great response. Fans are eager to love the new Star Wars, but most of the creations have been lack-luster at best. Rogue One was excellent. Mandalorian S1 & S2 were perfect, S3 (jumped a shark). Book of Boba, started good and a wheel fell off. Kenobi, redeemed itself at the end. Asoka....space whales & witches? The story was decent, but had a bizzare and pointless resolution to the series. Andor, started slow and became really good. This one, two episodes in and I think I know one character name. Acting was one-dimensional (except for ""Jason"" from the Good Place), and, none of it engaging.

But I digress. Two episodes in, and I'll likely try one more. But so far, this series will push more old fans away, sorry we've supported SW for so long now, and will do very little to entice new fans.",4.0,9 June 2024

What it does feel like it's a very high budget fan film. I just finished the first two episodes and cannot tell you how bland, boring, and poorly acted this is. I am not a hater of the showrunner at all. I am not a Disney Star Wars hater. I don't hate Kathleen Kennedy. In fact, I was rooting for this show to prove all the haters wrong because it is just ridiculous to be so vehemently opposed to something because of the obvious bias against the showrunner. That being said, this is as bad or worse than Kenobi, The Book of Boba Fett, The Last Jedi, The Rise of Skywalker, Resistance, The Ewoks films, and yes, even as bad as The Holiday Special. When the showrunner gives her wife such a prominent role, and she is literally the worst actor possibly in all of the history of Star Wars, then you realize rather quickly that there is no care given to even the most basic of filmmaking principles. Both episodes were so amateurishly produced on so many levels. I'm shocked this is so bad.

I'm rambling. This is a huge stain on the franchise and if the rumors about episode 3 are true then this might actually be the thing that pushes the fan base over the deep end. It's time to put people in charge that understand this franchise. John Knoll, perhaps? Rogue One is the very best we've gotten in the nine years since The Force Awakens and there hasn't been anything quite as good since. No, not even the Mandolorian nor Andor.

"Soy trash, created by green hair 14 y.o. girl","""Star Wars: The Acolyte,"" an upcoming series in the Star Wars universe, has generated significant anticipation and excitement globally. However, for audiences in post-Soviet countries, the series might be perceived negatively due to a combination of cultural, historical, and socio-political factors. Here are several reasons why ""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" could be problematic for this audience:

1. **Cultural Discrepancies and Western Dominance**:
**Cultural Disconnect**: The themes and narratives within the Star Wars universe, including ""The Acolyte,"" are deeply rooted in Western storytelling traditions. These may not resonate well with audiences from post-Soviet countries who have different historical and cultural narratives. The portrayal of good versus evil, heroism, and individualism might conflict with the collective and historical experiences of post-Soviet societies.




2. **Historical Context and Sensitivities**:




3. **Political and Ideological Differences**:




4. **Economic Factors**:




5. **Religious and Ethical Concerns**:




In conclusion, while ""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" has the potential to be a captivating addition to the franchise, its reception in post-Soviet countries may be hindered by cultural disconnects, historical sensitivities, political and ideological differences, economic factors, and religious concerns. Addressing these issues thoughtfully and with cultural sensitivity could help in bridging the gap and making the series more accessible and enjoyable for these audiences.",1.0,8 June 2024

The hope for the Star Wars franchise may be gone,"I've loved the other live action series that have came out and felt those along with the animated series were saving the franchise after the last trilogy, but this is definitely the worst Star Wars product yet. It feels like a cheaply made, teenage drama cash grab that had poor production and a storyline & dialogue that is not ""Star Wars"" at all.

Star Wars Has Become Such a Chore,"I've gone into all Disney Star Wars projects with an open mind. I was one of those fans saying, ""Wait for Ep VIII, maybe it'll all make sense"" back in 2015, and then ""Okay, that was pretty rough, but wait till it gets tied up in Ep IX"" in 2017. I've tried to find the good in the TV shows too, but it's been diminishing returns. At this point, keeping up with Star Wars is just a huge chore. With the exception of Season 1 of Mando and Season 1 of Andor, I haven't gotten any enjoyment out of it at all. I just do it out of rote obligation.

This is definitely true for The Acolyte. At best, it's completely middle-of-the-road, utterly unremarkable fanfic. At worst, it's unwatchable. Episode 3 was the tipping point for me. Awful child acting, lore-breaking, agenda-driven story decisions, bizarre, cringe-inducing scenes. I never thought I'd get here, but I think I'm done with Star Wars. I'll watch season 2 of Andor for sure, but I don't think I'll bother with any new Star Wars content.

It's quite a strange set up the characters certainly do not seem like Jedi (One of them who has spiky hair is obviously playing the village idiot type - How could someone like this? Become a Jedi knight?)

Camera, sound, lighting and CGI are all up to the modern standard we expect.

Carrie Anne Moss is absolutely perfect in her performance. Amanda Stenberg suits her role, as does Dafne Keen. However, Lee Jung jae is a little stilted, and Charlie Barnett and Thara Schoon are positively wooden in their opening moments, and for Charlie it doesn't improve much.

And it feels like the villain of the piece has already been revealed, I hope I'm wrong, as it would be pretty lazy writing to be able to spot it that early in to the first episode.

The Acolyte's real problem, is that viewers have been spoiled by Clone Wars, Bad Batch, Ahsoka, Andor, Mandalorian and Boba Fett. If The Acolyte had only had to follow on behind Episodes 7, 8 & 9 of the Skywalker Saga, then if would be accepted as good.

They are trying to make a cash cow. Shame.,"Are the writers unqualified or being held hostage on creativity? Some explanation on how the force can be used should be tied into the original series. The series shows no interest in connecting dots based on the books/comics. Actors who don't even know their roles or lore. Actors used to study roles for months. Who is driving the boat? I never thought I'd write a review on Star Wars but this show made me go out my way to copy and paste my confusion on the show. What ever happened to sticking to lore or creating NEW and individual content? To release series based on lore and what fans want to see. For example, everyone liked Mando and Boba doesn't mean we want to see them in everything. No one wants to see characters survive so easily with plot armor. Most characters saved by plot armor don't even contribute or add to the storyline, just little ""hey thanks, you're now family because you helped me out, so you should survive/do well since the fans might like you"". Lucas let so many Jedi die in the original series but this series, it's special on being so unlikable for the Jedi. OG written Jedi are not this delusional with their own lives the way this show portrays. To the extent that implies we should buy and pay them for the idea of likable characters. They so desperately want us to enjoy every character just because they want to appeal to general public. Disney should've just stayed away from Star Wars.",3.0,13 June 2024

Even though I know better I'll probably still give it a few more episodes to see if it gets better.

Slowly killing off my dreams of wanting to be a Jedi ...,"Was born in 1971 and Star Wars was my first film I saw at the cinema and it has been an unashamed part of my life ever since...

The original films will never be beaten and some recent films - rogue one , mandalorian, rebels , bad batch, Ashoka, andor /have been great. BUT... the problem with this franchise now is the amount of money it continually needs to generate and the younger audience it wants to captivate at the cost of the original and older fans. This series, so far, has almost been the ultimate insult to our loyalty and hopes of what could truly have been. Book of boba Fett was poor and the way Vader has been belittled with every appearance is criminal, but this series is next level rubbish. We don't need a lightsaber duel of force wielding every two minutes to be satisfied but what we really would like is good story telling, believable dialogue and captivating characters that we want to care about. Three episodes in at the time of this review and I have no enthusiasm to watch the next episode.

Disney please, please take a look at your other major franchise (the Mcu) and realise that less is more. The films and series are too frequent and are made without the necessary quality control, direction and overall plan for fans to want (or even need) to follow. The proof is in the box office sales and they have been falling dramatically after endgame. This is now happening to this beloved Star Wars franchise and the Rot is starting to settle in and won't stop.

We, as lifelong fans, don't need multiple spin offs, we just need quality over quantity. We want to watch the series and film and believe we can be part of that universe rather than looking at our watches to see how long the episode has left.

I hate to ever criticise but I also find it unbelievable that there is a creative team and executives that have all got together and produced this pile of drivel. Please please think of your original fan base and how this series captivated us and use the original blueprint to keep us and the new generations will follow.",3.0,12 June 2024
"Star wars is dead, it's time to move on.","This is a generic murder mystery, set within a sci fi context and with the words ""Star"" and ""wars"" slapped onto it. But this is not Star wars. This is like when your favorite restaurant changes owner but keeps the name and the interior design. Only when you look at the menu and taste the food do you realize that the new owners took advantage of the old establishments good name and they are now using it to promote their own cuisine. The problem is, the new owner offers a cuisine that is bland, mismatched and not very interesting. That is what Star wars has become in the hands of its new owner, Disney. A vessel they can fill with whatever they want, but not what the fans and the audience want, and The Acolyte is the pinnacle of their work. And it makes you wonder: for whom was The Acolyte made? It's obviously not made for the hard core Star wars fans, that's for sure. Even its director says so, publicly. And it's definitely not a kids show. And it's not made for the general streaming audience. So for whom was this show made? I really don't know and the show runners doesn't seem to have an answer either. I really wanted to like this show. On paper it sounded like an interesting route for Star wars to take. After watching the first two episodes I'm amazed this even got made. The script is put together from scraps off other, far better sci fi IPs like Alien, Matrix and Star wars (yes, because this is not Star wars despite Disney saying otherwise) and both the story and dialogue is painfully mediocre. Together with poor acting, cheap looking costumes and a non compelling story there is nothing left to be invested in. Some scenes feels rushed while others drag on forever and in the end you're left with only one simple question: why should I keep watching this? I am really baffled having watched these first two episodes of The Acolyte, wondering ""where did all the money go?"" By the look of it the money went into the pockets of an entitled and untalented group of people who uses the name of Star wars as a platform to tell their own mediocre stories.

Feels Amateurish,"First review on IMDB, so I am sorry if this isn't written well.

The Acolyte is the kind of show that would have done much better on cable TV. It's just pretty and interesting enough that you wouldn't switch it off until you hit an advertisement, but also wouldn't prepare your DVR for. In the streaming age though, I don't think you should seek this out when there is so much other science fiction (even just Star Wars) you could watch instead.

The main issue of the show is the writing which feels very fan fiction-like in the sense that the events aren't very well thought out. The focus of the show is on emotion-explosions (again, something that is common in fan fiction writing).

It's not all bad, it looks good and the actors are putting in great performances. The music and sounds are nice. It's not offensive in any way, in my opinion. It's just too boring to pay attention to nowadays, especially when compared to the excitement of the movies. The first episode started off well, though!",5.0,12 June 2024

Beyond atrocious!!,"I am convinced Kathleen Kennedy hates George Lucas and Star Wars. Over the years she and her lemmings have done everything possible to destroy the lore of Star Wars.

The acting, writing, and directing was amateurish. I was embarrassed for the actors in it, though they deserve it for taking part in this cruddy show. The chanting scene of the witches took cringe to a whole new level. I can already tell they are trying to make the Jedi the villains of the series. We all know the Jedi would have no interest in the twins at their age, they are too old to train! It was the main reason the Jedi council didn't want Anakin to be trained. From the first episode this series was difficult to watch but after this episode 3, I'm done!.

This is what happens when you hire based off DEI ideology and not off merit. You end up with a studio full of narcissistic activist who only care about pushing their agenda and they don't care if the house burns down in the process.

Visually, the show had some impressive moments, but they were few and far between. The special effects felt inconsistent, and some scenes looked surprisingly low-budget for a series of this caliber. The fight choreography was another letdown, lacking the excitement and finesse that fans have come to expect from Star Wars.

They are really trying to push their political views. I have nothing against trying to push a worldview that is what film is for, but when it causes a company to make bad films that is when there is a problem.",3.0,14 June 2024
Star Wars: The End,"Wow wow wow, I am totally lost for words. Every time I set my expectations low, Disney manages to outperform and release an even worse product. The Acolyte is a laughably bad show with horrific acting. The only good actor is the Asian Jedi master, who by all means, has knocked it out of the park. The rest of the actors are mediocre at best. Now let's get to the hilariously bad plot. Nothing in the plot line seems to follow basic cause and effect with the directors just inserting random facts to serve their aims. Also, I seem to recall Jedi being known for their physical and mental strength? Evidently not based off that one actor.",1.0,13 June 2024
Disney cares more about quantity rather than quality,"There are SO many shows coming out on Disney+ and this is one of the very worst. Star Wars was about inner strength, hope, destiny, and the force. These new shows are headed in so many wildly different directions that deviate from what Star Wars was all about. I'm convinced they simply don't care what they put out as long as they put something out. In the beginning I thought it was nice to have access to the Disney classics and the marvel movies but I'm done. One less monthly bill to pay now that I cancelled my Disney+.

The Art of Cringe,"Here is the revised version of your text with improved grammar and clarity:

You can't fake good writing. To write a good story, and especially interesting characters and dialogues, you need, besides talent, above all, hard work. These days, wherever I look, writers mostly fail, and fail heavily: The Walking Dead franchise - dead. The Star Wars franchise - dead. The Game of Thrones and The Lord of the Rings franchises - dead. Some of these shows (prequels, sequels, whatever) provide solid or decent productions, but that's it. They all lack heart and soul, and the writing is not even at an acceptable mediocre level. The Acolyte is, in my opinion, one of the worst productions, and there are really some bad productions in the Star Wars universe to this day. This has only one high level - in the art of cringe. I have read a lot of pulp stories in my life, but some of them are almost Nobel Prize candidates in comparison. The Acolyte is really bad; how this got green-lighted is beyond my imagination. I'm pretty sure, despite using fast-forwarding excessively, I still lost some brain cells watching this massive fail.",2.0,14 June 2024
Made an account just to warn you about this junk,"Disney have done some terrible things to Star Wars over the years. But not like this. Never like this.

The acting is beyond wooden. Every line of dialogue feels like teenage fanfiction.

The content itself shows a disregard for Star Wars lore and canon (and the sci-fi genre in general) like nothing I've ever seen. It feels like whoever wrote this was given a two-page dossier on what Star Wars is with no prior knowledge before being handed the helm, perhaps in a last-ditch ""well they couldn't make things any worse"" gamble. Bad luck Kathleen, it's worse. It's so much worse. Disney. You do not know what Star Wars is. It is time to stop. Please stop.",1.0,13 June 2024
This is Star Wars?,"""The Acolyte,"" the $180 million (Not to mention the tens of millions they spent on marketing) Star Wars prequel ""series"". Brace yourself, because it seems this one is going to be a lot to take in.

""The Acolyte"" The series falls extremely flat in several areas:

Tepid Story: Despite the colossal budget, the story lacks excitement. It's a ho-hum agenda pushing adventure with mythological convolutions that fail to engage.

Failed Formulaic Prequel: Not all sagas need endless prequels, and ""The Acolyte"" proves this point. It adds nothing fresh while also ruining the core of what started the whole saga to begin with.

Logical Fallacies: Critics have pointed out logical inconsistencies, hokey dialogue, nonsensical plots, horrible acting, and an extremely apparent ""message"" that the show is trying to push. It feels mishmash at best.

Audience Dissonance: Critics and audiences are miles apart on this one. While critics have praised it (Clearly paid for...), audiences have given it a harsh 18%!!! Score on Rotten Tomatoes (at this time).

In summary, ""The Acolyte"" struggles to recapture the magic of the original trilogy. It will be a forgettable addition to the Star Wars universe (other than how terrible it is), running on fumes rather than the Force (or the ""thread"", LOL are you kidding..). Overall, this is (as of now) the worst Star Wars ""Disney Cannon"" to date. This is what happens when you have top producers who do not care about the fan base, or the actual product, they want nothing more than to push an agenda.",1.0,14 June 2024
Typical Disney Product,"""Good Luck Charlie"" had more thought and care put into it than this embarrassing mess of a show. The acting is awful, and the dialogue is somehow even worse. It's clear from watching the episodes and watching interviews that neither any of the cast members nor any of the showrunners have ever even seen a Star Wars film.

The whole thing is disrespectful to both the audience and Star Wars as a franchise. When the prequels were first released, they were met with similar (although much more positive) reviews. But over time, they became just as beloved as the original trilogy. However, ""The Acolyte,"" along with the sequel trilogy and every other rushed, garbage TV show they pump out onto Disney+ (save the first two seasons of ""The Mandalorian""), will clearly never get any love or fanbase in the future. There is just no substance, care, or even thought put into this waste-of-time show, and I am giving up on watching it after the first three episodes. Rest in peace, Star Wars. You had an amazing run.",1.0,13 June 2024
Ugh!!! Horrible interpretation of Star Wars,"To the writers of this sure to be cancelled series, what a disappointment! It's obvious to the viewer the writing staff were extremely unfamiliar with Star Wars. The only redeeming quality of this production are the sights and sounds of the show.....This is NOT Star Wars, it's hard to understand what this story has do with Star Wars other than the settings. Disney, if you are serious about promoting and continuing with the successful financial endeavor, you MUST hire knowledgeable Star Wars creators and writers. At the reported $180 million per episode....it has to hurt that it is a complete FLOP.

Easily the worst attempt at a Star Wars franchise series,"To not repeat the many other complaints and criticisms posted this series (3 episodes in) can be reduced to a very simple summary: the writing is horrible - it is full of weak cliche and overly familiar tropes with little resemblence to the original movies. The directing (possibly editing) is laughable. I was not expecting auteur here but the lazy approach to the filming coupled with fast cuts and scene change makes it feel more like a cell phone commercial or a really poor attempt at an 80s MTV music video. But probably the worst part of this series is the acting or, the absence of any acting. The characters seem 2 dimensional, unconvincing and dispassionate. Soime of the more dialogue heavy scenes remind me of grammar school plays directed by middle schoolers. If you ahve a child in the series you may applaudde but the rest of the TV audience will look at you and wonder if your actually watching hte ballgame on your cell phone. Does anyone remember when the name Disney inspired strong anticipation for a film? I miss those days but this last effort is not worth the cost of the ""cans that held the film.""

No intresting characters,"Why do you make a series about this characters when there are so many intresting once from starwars to build on.

Younger yoda how he lerned about the force, chewbacka before he met han solo, darth mauls story before he got recruited. Anakins mother? Or even the guy trying to trick them for parts at tattooen.

Several scenes are nonsensical and disrupt the established world-building and continuity from previous Star Wars content.

The plot lacks coherence, and the characters are poorly developed, making it hard to connect with them. Iconic elements of the Star Wars universe are misused or ignored.

Not sure I've ever seen anything worse.,,1.0,13 June 2024
This is so bad that i cancelled my disney+,"Star Wars: The Acolyte"" has become one of the most anticipated additions to the Star Wars universe, but expectations have not been entirely met. The series has turned out to be a disappointment on several fronts.

Firstly, the storyline is weak and disjointed. It promised to explore a new era within the Star Wars universe, but the end result feels superficial and unfulfilling. Character development is lacking, making it difficult to connect with the new figures. Their motives and backgrounds are poorly presented, leaving the audience with more questions than answers.

Moreover, the series suffers from uneven production. The special effects are far from the standards we have come to expect from a Star Wars production. Some scenes feel cheap and half-finished, breaking the illusion and pulling the viewer out of the story. Costumes and set design sometimes appear just as sloppy, which is particularly noticeable in a franchise known for its attention to detail and world-building.

The dialogues are another major weakness. Many of the lines feel flat and clichéd, lacking the sharpness and charm that previous Star Wars films and series have delivered. This contributes to making the scenes feel drawn-out and uninteresting.

Another aspect that fails is the direction. It often feels like the actors are unsure of their roles, and their performances suffer as a result. Instead of creating engaging and memorable characters, most of them feel like they are just going through the motions.",1.0,13 June 2024
I was a star wars fan,"Even from my childhood Star Wars gave me hope and and imagination no matter of race or ideology. I used to think about it before going to sleep, that I will have a dream that I'm a Jedi or a Sith. Now I know two things, as for one for me 1-6 remains a the original with Rouge one and other series from the past (animated or not). Two if this scheme continues there will be no more hope for to be excited about any new Star Wars content. I cannot understand why are you destroying our dreams and with it our love towards this title. Maybe pressure maybe not, but you have to understand that you are not making a new but to continue something which is very important for countless people. Please act like it.",1.0,13 June 2024
This show sucks,"And here I thought we couldn't get any worse than the current movie trilogy, but then Disney drops this sad show. It feels like we sat 3 year olds in front of a story board and let them scribble on it for a few hours and decided to make a series out of it. I wish I could say that there were only some parts that I didn't like and it had some saving grace, but both of the first 2 episodes are so terrible that I ended up watching YouTube videos instead. When is Disney going to just stop making up terrible plots and actually make a good star wars production. They took some of the best material and made it non canon because they retroactively make a decent me off of it. Watching new Star Wars shows and movies makes me think that no one at Disney had even heard of Star Wars before they made the trash they have been putting out as of late. After this one I think I'm probably just going to delete Disney+.",1.0,13 June 2024
What happened,"How is it even possible to mess up so damn bad, the only good thing about this show is Lee Jung-Jae at least he's a great actor. Everything else is laughable the fight scenes actually had me laughing since even fan fights are better. Why don't the directors listen more to the people who actually watch this stuff instead of tryna make their own new fan base out of this stuff. What we need is a director who listens to fans at least a little bit because imagine if someone with the average Star Wars interests was directing a Star Wars show set in the high republic it would actually be amazing but instead we get this. Some of the actors are actually decent it's just that the directing is so unbelievably awful it takes away from their skill.",1.0,14 June 2024
worst star wars since the special,"Like with most recent Marvel and Star Wars shows (bar Andor and X-Men 97), Disney appears to have lost touch with ALL (yes, all!) basic aspects of telling a good story through the visual medium: the script and dialogue ranges from poor to cringe-inducing, logic and basic physics are totally absent (statements are contradicted scene to scene, bonfires burn happily in space), CGI and costume design are weak and sets claustrophobic despite a massive budget of 180 euro, and the only two half-competent actors in the show (Carrie-Ann Moss and the guy from Squid Game) are wasted (in each their own way).

Whether this is down to Disney's first priority appearing to be to comply with as many ESG/DEI requirements per show (to appease main investor Blackrock) and to hire people for their provocative profile rather than competence, is hard to tell (it appears so). It is a pity because there is the gist of a good premise in the Acolyte that any half-competent amateur writer could have turned into a fairly compelling tale. Any story told competently is welcomed by the broad fan-base and had the Acolyte headed this lesson and had somene like Tony Gilroy at the helm - it could have been a roaring success.

As it is, you can extract a few tolerable scenes if you are willing to torture yourself with material as bad as the witches' chant in episode 3 (so bad you will volunteer for an hour long session of people running their nails over a blackboard after hearing it) but that is as far as it goes.",1.0,14 June 2024
Shambolic,"As you watch this series, it becomes evident that those who are responsible for this show do not understand what Star Wars is about. They don't respect the lore and are simply trying to shove agendas into a TV series. They disrespect the fans by simply taking away the meaning and significance of established lore.

The issue is that Disney keeps hiring individuals who aren't passionate about Star Wars. It should be a requirement that those who are in creative control of these shows understand the lore and the significance of everything that has come before it.

It's still too early to review it in its entirety!,"The Acolyte is the latest victim of Disney's Star Wars review-bobbing and Disney+'s latest entry in expanding the Saga in the world of streaming. Now though I said it's still too early to critique the whole thing, it's proving a bit of an iffy entry into Star Wars' lofty canon in film and television.

The Acolyte does do some stuff right like nailing the vibe of Star Wars, but the writing seems a tad shallow and the actors are making the best of the material they're stuck with. Maybe with all the whining people are making about this show now the other stuff on Disney+ isn't so... bad?

Honestly: the premature backlash just doesn't seem right UNTIL the entire thing's been released. I said this about Obi-Wan Kenobi and I'll stick with this argument for every other time this becomes an issue. Review-bombing just seems like an immature way to adversely affect products people deem as 'woke' or 'bad' so early on. The Acolyte is competent television, but it ain't the golden age 'event television' The Mandalorian proved itself to be. Heck, Acolyte ain't on the same level as The Bad Batch. Hopefully Skeleton Crew will be an improvement.

P. S. It's certainly pissed off some people for the right reasons, but some of the 'feedback' seems to be coming from Prequel apologists thinking the word owes George Lucas an 'overdue apology'.

Also Dialogue often feels forced and unnatural, detracting from the story's immersion.

Forget about Star Wars angle, even non Star Wars fans will also find the writing and direction as very poor. Such bad approach of creative(?) team really makes it unbearable to watch and this by any means is not good for a franchise which has been loved by generations. If you feel so creative, make a series which has new characters, the characters and canon which is loved by the fans doesn't need such influence of someone who doesn't even know much about the star wars.

You know what attracts females to Star Wars? Same thing that attracts men....good writing. Is that so incredibly difficult? Do these writers even put ""interesting storyline"" in their top 10 goals for a script? This is just yet another insult to Star Wars crammed with obvious messaging and void of anything else.

Exceptional - Clone Wars meets Force Awakens,"I am loving this series 3 episodes in. The writing is sharp and nuanced. Characters are sympathetic and complex, with intriguing backstories and motivations. The world building so far has been quite good, if a bit backyard budget biome in places. As a longtime PT and TCW fan, it feels so good to see Coruscant again, and I love how this show is exploring the political intrigue and tensions that come with the territory, and exploring the themes that arise from inserting a powerful monastic order right at the center of galactic politics.

Extra props to the creators for writing a multi-sided mystery while, keeping its secrets while holding both the characters and the audience on more or less the same page. Nothing is more frustrating than tension and conflict caused by misunderstanding, miscommunication, characters having incomplete information, or inexplicable bias toward forcing the plot in a certain way. So far the show is navigating this deftly while still managing to give each character time to breathe and develop in the spotlight. Well done!

Overall, I like this a lot. The production feels slick, and similar to The Force Awakens, and aside from the few uninspired biomes I've mentioned, it feels otherworldly and just as Star Wars should. I can't wait to see where it goes from here.

Objective facts: Star Wars is a space opera media franchise which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly became an iconic worldwide pop culture phenomenon. The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe. Star Wars is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. The original 1977 film, retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope, was followed by the sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, forming the original Star Wars trilogy.
