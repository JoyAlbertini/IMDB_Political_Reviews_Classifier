Final chapter,,5.0,18 December 2019
The Legend of action is back and is more violent than ever!!!,"Rambo Last Blood (2019)

At 73, most people prefer to sit at home, relax and reminisce their youth while being surrounded by their family. Sylvester Stallone was not built that way and this year he made a movie to prove that action stars of the 80s simply don't age. Obviously he has lost a step or two and is not flying around the screen like he used to but at bloody 73, he is still a one man army and the living proof that age is just a number.

Rambo Last Blood is a no nonsense grim action movie with a cliche plot that does not pretend be bigger than it is. Nobody is saving the world from mass enslavement, spies or nuclear threats. It is a simple revenge thriller with loads of action, grit and violence that can easily rival John Wick in terms of creativity. Stallone is a lone wolf who still has sharp fangs despite his gray hair and his enemies will find out just how sharp these fangs are.

Very similar to previous Rambo films, just on a smaller scale, so it goes without saying that if you are a fan of the franchise, 80-90s action or Stallone in general then you will feel right at home. Fast pace, simple narrative, grim settings and plently of violence give Last Blood a genuine throwback feel to the golden days of action.

Taken meets Home Alone in this disappointing end to the Rambo Saga.,,5.0,27 November 2019
Last Blood,"Dark, brutal, graphic and extreme are some of the words I would use to sum this movie up. Pretty standard story but it does take us to some unexpected dark places. Sly does what he does best in a strong, silent brooding role. The big winner here is the action. As we come to expect the final climatic battle is very violent and graphic but executed very very well.",,7 March 2020
Unnecessary sequel but still a blast for Stallone fans.,"Even though i enjoyed Last Blood i feel like the franchise could have comfortably ended with Rambo 4. Rambo had just fought in the biggest and most brutal battle of his life and then returned to his family home, it felt like closure. Last Blood feels like it wasn't originally meant to be a Rambo movie but it's still a hell of a good time for Stallone fans and fans of no bull action movies.

Apparently this movie upset some fragile critics who called it a ""Trumpian fantasy"" whatever the hell that is supposed to mean, i wish those losers would stop trying to create drama and controversy where there is none. The fact that the film made back almost twice it's budget in theatres is the sweet icing on the cake.

Anyway, this time Rambo is fighting a more personal battle as he attempts to rescue the daughter of a close friend who's been kidnaped by a sex ring in Mexico. Stallone as always nails it as the hard as stone warrior we all love but now he has an almost softer more emotional side to him which i really enjoyed. The action scenes are insanely violent with heads exploding from shotgun blasts, guys behind impaled on spikes, blown up with claymores, stabbed through various parts of their bodies and burnt to a crisp. It's definitely not for the squeamish but this is a Rambo movie, you don't watch one expecting sunshine, rainbows and tea parties. I mean, the final battle in Rambo 4 was like a level from Gears Of War ffs. Also Stallone is 73 years old and looks to be in better condition than most men half his age. He is JACKED and is still believable as an unstoppable force of nature. The story won't win any awards but it also doesn't pretend to be any grander than it needs to be. This is a straight up, grim revenge movie.

Most fans of the series have most likely seen it and don't need a recommendation but check this out if you like hard edged action and want a throwback to the glory days of American action movies.

A Finale that Fails to Truly Honor it's Hero,"Rambo: Last Blood is the supposedly the final film in the Rambo series. A series that has certainly seen better days. Last Blood's title infers a finale that could wrap the decades old series in a nice little bow and call back to the film that started it all. However, it fails to truly honor its hero in a satisfying way.

The first film First Blood seems so tamed compared to this newest entry and looking back the series as a whole has changed along the way. First Blood was a film based on the novel of the same name that followed a man struggling to reenter society after the Vietnam War. It was a topical film showcasing the cruelty and disgust many of our veterans received upon returning home. First Blood was a film with scenes of violence, but it was not an action film. It was as far as I can see an anti war film. Every film after this has failed to understand what this film was about and has opted for a more action heavy series and a violent one at that.

Last Blood is First Blood's polar opposite. It relishes in its violence especially in the 3rd act, but at least in this film the reason and motive is clear and can be understood. Last Blood is not concerned with telling the story of a man haunted by war or telling an anti war story. Its focus is on violent revenge and I have to look at it this way. The Rambo series has transformed itself into something completely different from the first film. So, does this work as a revenge thriller?

I would say yes in the most simplistic sense. This is the story of a man who wants to live his final years in peace but is called to action once again to protect someone he loves. It's a story we know all too well. However, it has proved an emotionally resonant story in the past. Rambo's story in this film and his goal is simple and it's simple to a fault, but this film is not concerned with its story as much as it is the action this series has become known for.

Let's talk about the action. I won't lie it's fun. The third act is insane and over the top and indulges in grotesque violence that will bring out the cave man in all of us. This would be fine, other Stallone movies have indulged in violence before and that's the main selling point. His Expendibles trilogy is a great example, but Last Blood tries for something more and lays the seeds for what should be an emotional crescendo for our John Rambo, but the film doesn't do enough to make this satisfying and so the film ends up feeling unbalanced.

Rambo's relationship with his niece is the heart of the film and helps in at least giving an emotional connection the film sorely needs. However, these are about the only characters that have any form of depth. The villains are 1 dimensional and nothing more and are there simply to be part of an endless army for Rambo to mutilate and maim in glorious over the top violence which is fun. The film however has a saving grace in the form of Stallone and his performance. Stallone has always been an underrated actor and I believe it hasn't been until recently that he's been receiving some of the recognition he deserves.

The movies problems perhaps are a result of its extremely short length. If anyone knows about the making of this film it was constantly cut down in the editing room to make it 89 minutes, the shortest Rambo film to date. I believe in a longer version of this film lies a film that is much better, that balances out its more meditative moments with its bursts of violence.

As it stands the film feels unbalanced and has an extremely slow and boring first two acts that ends on an action packed finale and the the final moments of the film feel like they should be more impactful than they end up being. These last few moments are the best parts of the film and make it feel more like a finale. Perhaps an extended version of the film could be released to fix many of these films short comings, but we'll have to wait and see.

Overall, Rambo: Last Blood is a film that has the right stuff to make this finale great, but what is there is either not enough or cut down to reach a certain runtime. Stallone's performance makes it at least worth a watch as it tries it's best to blend the series violent aspects with the more character driven first film.",6.0,3 October 2019

Rambo: Last Blood is a hollow, self-contained sequel that manages to be both inconsistent and completely unnecessary for the character. The main plot points are so brief and uninspired that I am not sure why they didn't just cut out the entire first hour and summarize it in a cue card at the beginning. The girl who gets captured is a brand new, unknown, stubborn, and unlikable character made up for this film, essentially so she can be used as a prop to provoke Rambo's rage. This would have been forgivable had the film been honest about not wanting to do the drama and just jumped into the action. Instead we get a half-baked and uninteresting first hour trying to convince us why Rambo should care about her.

The film takes a bloodlust angle. Having just watched the first four installments, this is inconsistent to a degree with his character in that it's the only Rambo where he is actually motivated inside himself to go kill-rather than a victim to the system used and exploited for his supersoldier training in a way that places him in a moral dilemma he cannot refuse, like how it always has been with every other Rambo film.

Some are calling this MAGA: The Movie. There is a 20-second sequence where John Rambo goes rogue and is crossing the US-Mexico border back into the United States. He stops his truck at a flimsy little wooden fence in a field in the middle of the night, then rams the truck through the fence with ease. He goes on to lure a group of Mexican criminals, rapists, gang members, & murderers across the border to trespass onto his property where he proceeds to gun them down one by one. This film is every xenophobe's fantasy. The final half hour is just a series of deaths the enemies walk right into without any kind of resistance or forethought. Rambo is not challenged whatsoever. It is simply a massacre, like watching an old man slaughter goats.

One redeeming quality of this film is the score from Brian Tyler. He takes Rambo's Battle Adagio theme from the previous film and mixes in some A Monster Calls (Fernando Vel√†zquez) and LOTR (Howard Shore). This song takes place in a memorable scene just before the Trump wall advertisement.

Last Blood is legitimately not a good Rambo film. It isn't quite ""pretend it never existed"" bad, but it is quite a step back after the large step forward that was the previous installment.

Rambo Lives!,"I felt compelled to write this review after reading the backlash this movie has received of being racist and unnecessarily violent. I'm Mexican, I saw this movie in a cinema obviously filled with Mexicans.. no one felt offended!!!! Everyone was cheering towards the end and that final montage hit the feelings note perfectly. Rambo is a character embedded deeply in Mexican pop culture as well as in many other countries, and it hurts me to say it, but the villains you see in this movie is a reality that happens in my country, if anything I congratulate Stallone for denouncing that criminal activity. It's not a perfect movie, and it does have a different feeling than the other ones, but when Rambo finally appears you'll feel it and at his most cold blooded self he can be, the violence while gruesome, I didn't feel it unnecesary especially if you know how this Criminal Bands operate. So go to the cinema, enjoy this movie for what it is, and feel secure that south of the border we are ohh so happy to have another Rambo movie and no one is feeling offended!!",9.0,24 September 2019
Have to write a review after watching it,"I haven't been writing a review in here for years, but after watching Rambo last night, I felt it is needed, since we will never see Stallone as Rambo again.

This Rambo is the weakest in the lineup. At times I was thinking, why do they even call it Rambo, could name the movie anything else. I didn't get the Rambo feeling throughout the whole movie, and I grew up with these movies loving them.

Only cause of Stallone I give it 6 otherwise its a 5.

My favorite will always be first blood, the very first one, then Rambo 2, then 3, then 4 and lastly this one. Don't get me wrong, I still loved this one. Sly still has it at 73 years of age.

I won't spoil the ending, but it's classic Rambo in God mode. 50 guys, what an insult!!!",7.0,30 January 2021
Very Distant from the Rest of the Franchise,"The Rambo franchise hasn't been known for its subtleties and that was proven when Sylvestre Stallone returned to the role back in 2008. The amount of violence throughout that film gave action junkies everything they were asking for. It also took the outrageously bloody aspect of the franchise to another level as well. Wrapped up in a nice bow by the time the credits rolled, 2008s Rambo seemed to be the finale. Well, apparently not, as Rambo: Last Blood is now in theatres. Sadly, this franchise definitely should have ended with the previous instalment. Here's why I believe this movie simply doesn't work.

Now retired and taking care of a ranch out in the county, John Rambo has evolved into a (seemingly) much calmer man. After his niece makes a poor decision to find out the truth of who her real father has become out in Mexico, all hell breaks loose as John finds himself on the hunt to save his family. Without ruining anything, one thing leads to another and he eventually needs to use his home as a giant war zone/booby-trap to fend off his enemies. In theory, this premise is a great set-up for an action film that simply wants to focus on the action itself, but it really doesn't feel anything like a Rambo movie.

Being a war veteran and fending off his enemies throughout the course of his entire life, John Rambo is a character with a lot of complexities. For this reason alone, many of the Rambo films have been able to tell interesting stories, even if the execution wasn't always there. This time around, he has become a family man and an emotional tie is what gets him back in the game. The finale of this movie is the only remotely entertaining aspect, but the set-up for it just felt like an excuse for a revenge movie, which is never truly what the Rambo films have been.

Stallone is committed to this character as always and Yvette Monreal as his niece is actually quite good, but their dynamic just felt like it belonged in another movie. With the addition of some very cheesy dialogue at times and the fact that John Rambo is the only one who feels like a real, fleshed-out character, I found myself not really caring about what happened to anyone here. That said, audiences who watch Rambo movies are usually there for the action anyways, and if you're a fan of gory violence that's done well, then the final 20 minutes may be enough for you.

In the end, Rambo: Last Blood is a mixture of elements from movies like Taken and Home Alone, with an elderly war hero at the forefront and the violence cranked up to a thousand. There are moments of enjoyment and even a few times where I was having a little fun, but it really is an emotional movie that doesn't feel earned. It asks you to care about characters that haven't been around for much of the franchise and I just couldn't buy it. For die-hard fans of the franchise, maybe check it out once it's available to rent or buy at home, but I really don't think it's worth your time.",4.0,2 October 2019

Should have been made a very long time ago,"REVIEW - RAMBO LAST BLOOD

Ok let's be real here, how long can an actor draw out a character, Rambo First Blood was released in 1982 so the answer is 37 years, why am I saying this, simple, Sylvester Stalone is now 73 so realistically he can't do now what he did 37 years ago, age creeps up on us all.

So with this in mind and paying respect to his age is Last Blood actually worth going to see?

Yes and no.

Yes as it finally puts to bed the character John Rambo so if your a true die hard (no alternative actor pun intended) then sure spend your money but as a film.

Yes, honesty it's nowhere near First Blood, its definitely better than all of the previous sequels but.

No, the story is weak, long winded for such a simple story and the real action is literally the last 15 minutes of the film.

Ok Sylvester can't do what he did 37 years ago but respect to him for trying but this should have been made a long long long time ago.

"John Rambo Last Blood was a good but unnecessary movie, not with this ending anyway....","Oh man, John Rambo is back. He is cooler now because he has PTSD and something to live for. Imagine if you try to take this away from him. Do you think he will let you live, after this? No, you are wrong ! In this latest installment John leaves humid jungles of Vietnam and Burma, he is no longer hiking through dense forests of USA, harsh deserts of Afghanistan are abandoned. John is home, back on his farm. He will venture to Mexico for his next adventure. Here the two movie genres clash and we have Rambo Last Blood. Heavy Taken and Home alone influences shape this movie into decent, watchable yet predictable spectacle.

There is not much to be said about it really. John Rambo builds underground tunnels in his spare time, sort of the ones he experienced in Nam. He likes to collect weapons and explore tunnels at night. It is is refuge, the physical representation of his conflicted and scared by war mind.

This part of the movie I really liked. Rambo internal struggle with reality and at the same time a gimps of hope. Uncle Rambo looks after the farm and his niece. He lives on the farm with people close to him. His life has meaning again. He is not happy but content with life. He takes his medication and spends his time breeding horses and doing farm stuff. He spends lots of his time with his niece and reflects on life.

One night his niece decides to go to Mexico to look for her father. That's how the rampage begins, that's how story unravels. Rambo warned the girl ! Grandma warned the girl but she is young and naive. She wants to find out why her father left her, why? Is it because he did not care about her. How could you not care for your daughter you dirty man. She does not understand that some people like John said had black hearts. They are rotten inside. He begs her not to go but she did and it did not end up well for her. This pure, innocent life was trapped in a cruel world she was not prepared to face. This is very sad part of the story and direction producers took was very cruel to the Rambo's character. He can not even find rest on his farm and the little he has is still taken away from him.

He is a very tragic character in my opinion.

It is up to Rambo to try to rescue her. John crosses the border and his search for her takes him through the world he does not understand but knows how to tear it apart in order to try to save the girl.

Movie final scene was well worth waiting for. It is a shame that movie was not little longer. When Rambo was in his rampage mode the movie finished. I would like to see this momentum going and have 20 minutes more of John, maybe even him returning to Mexico to completely dismantle whole underworld.

Rambo was entertaining but I personally liked the way Rambo 4 ended much, much more. He deserved the ending he got and while I found Last Blood entertaining I am really sad for this character. Life did not treat John well and after everything he has been through he deserved a better ending.",7.0,10 October 2019

Turns out geriatric Rambo is a badass!,"So I must admit I didnt have very high hopes going in to see this movie, the idea of a man in his 70's playing this kind of character combined with the critics scores (which at the moment are appalling low) made me think this would not turn out to be a good film. I was very wrong I am happy to say.

Just like the first movie in the series this movie has a very important lesson embedded in a very gritty and entertaining story. I dont wish to include spoilers in this review so i will just say in that regard that the story revolves around the naivety of youth brought up in a secure environment and just not understanding the brutality of the real world and the consequences that can have.

This movie is fairly gory which is not normally my thing but in the context of a story looking to highlight the brutal realities it has an important part to play in really bringing that home to the viewer.

I have to say this was a great all round movie and if this is indeed the final chapter for the Rambo character I think it really went out with a bang. I strongly recommend going to view this.",9.0,20 September 2019
LOL. WHAT the HELL was this?,"Stallone fans are giving this a 10; and NO, it is in no way a 10. The Godfather is a 10! Sheesh!

That said, it isn't bad.

It starts out pretty evenly-paced, and surprisingly, really well-acted. Even Stallone is believable. He does look ancient, however, and it tugs at ones' heartstrings to think he really IS THAT old. The girl who plays Gabriela, the girl he refers to as his niece, is really cute and she too can either act, or, had a seamless rapport with Stallone which made their scenes together almost flawless.

The thing that got me, is how gory the film is. I didn't mind it, but it did surprise me. It's Rambo Last BLOOD after all, so we knew there would be blood, just not as much as there was. The death scenes are well done, if just a tad fantastical, but all in all they satisfy.

I really wish IMDB had .5 scores, as this one is a 6.5. Not anything that you will be talking about next year, but good enough to enjoy now.",7.0,1 December 2019

Bloody and violent old school action flick,"OK, so I have to admit: I can't help but love Sly Stallone. The guy just keeps coming back succesfully, against all odds. Who would have thought that he could pull off another Rambo flick at age 73? Well, I'm glad he did, because besides Liam Neeson, Denzel Washington and Mel Gibson, who are we gonna turn to for some old school, old-man-on-a-revenge-spree flick?

I was a big fan of First Blood, but didn't care so much for the second (too cartoonish) and third (too friggin' awful) installments. The fourth however, was just amazing. A slow build up, a suspenseful breakout and then cathartic violence. That last action sequence, where Rambo goes totally berserk and makes minced meat out of a whole army, I mean, come on, that was awesome.

The fifth Rambo is a little different in that it is more of a generic revenge flick in its setup. But only in its setup though. As soon as Rambo starts maiming and killing, this movie goes so far over the top you can't help but cheer him on. This is one bloody movie. Last blood it may be, but it is many a full bucket of it.

I also like how Rambo is more vulnarable in this flick. Stallone gets to use more of his acting chops in this one.

I know it's a lot to ask, and maybe I shouldn't even hope for it, but damn it, I sure would like another one of these.",8.0,18 September 2019
Last Blood is John Rambo's most personal mission and it's definitely not for the squeamish,"Still haunted by past events John Rambo is trying to keep a lid on his raging emotions and now lives his later years on a secluded ranch with his young niece and her grandmother. When Rambo's niece makes the ill-judged decision to try and locate her father in Mexico she ends up being kidnapped by the cartel. Upon hearing the news, Rambo must call upon his old skills to rescue his niece before it's too late....

I thought First Blood was a terrific film, but have found everything else that followed to be a little bit disappointing so didn't really know what to expect from this fifth instalment. The truth is, at least as far as I'm concerned, Last Blood is the best offering since First Blood.

Perhaps what gives the film an edge over some of its predecessors is that it is more personal in nature; in some of the earlier films Rambo was assigned to/completed missions more out of a sense of duty then anything else; sure you always got the feeling he cared about the people he was helping to an extent, but aside from the first film I generally found myself being a little emotionally detached and therefore could never find the sequels quite as satisfying.

In this instalment because it is a family member that Rambo has to rescue there is already an emotional connection; it's also clear that Rambo's first rescue attempt is driven more by rage and emotion; normally Rambo would carefully plan any kind of rescue mission, but as it is one of his family he just bulldozes in and ends up being overwhelmed. Poor planning is understandable in this film as Rambo just wants to save his niece as quickly as possible and rational thought is not at the forefront of his mind at this stage. This shows a vulnerability with Rambo that we perhaps hadn't witnessed much of since the first film and starts to show more of a human touch to him.

An incident later in the film causes Rambo to set up his campaign against the Cartel which leads to a thrilling finale which felt closer to First Blood; a tension filled climax where Rambo must pits his wits against the cartel and try to thwart their attack at seemingly impossible odds. It was this aspect that I loved about the first film and I'm so glad that we get to see a lot of the Rambo of old in Last Blood.

Given the personal nature of this film, Rambo is understandably peed off and he is at his most brutal in this film so if you're squeamish or aren't a fan of gory violence then be warned; then again it is Rambo so surely you'd know how these films play out by now.

Last Blood surprised me as I genuinely didn't expect much from it, but the script made me care for Rambo and see him as a person again which is something I've not really witnessed since the first film. That coupled with its fairly quick pace and its gripping finale made it a very satisfying and enjoyable film.",7.0,15 June 2021
Sorry but this isn't Rambo unless he is suppose to be senile...,,1.0,22 November 2019
How much blood is left?,"It wasn't so much that the general public wanted or cried for another Rambo, it was Stallone himself that wanted to have a closure with that character. And I would say he succeeds in that. So there was an extra scene in front of the movie in the European cinema version. It's another character moment but it also had an appearance by Luis Mandylor that was quite nice to see.

All this aside, you can tell that Rambo has gotten old. When all kicks off (and you can tell that it'll go south, no pun intended), you are not surprised. Or you shouldn't be. You could be surprised on how John Rambo is handling a certain situation! Then again, an inciting incident has to happen, doesn't it? The answer is yes.

In the end credits there is flashbacks to the previous Rambo movies, which was a nice thing to see. There is a sense of this being the last one - then again who knows? A remake or reimagening is always a possibility isn't it? This right here has a lot of violence, which might be rewarding or not for the viewer ...",7.0,4 December 2019
Rambo returns for #OneLastTime,"The movie is really well done in terms of action and it doesnt hold back on its gruesomeness when it comes to deaths/kills. The story is somewhat cliched and its something we have seen before in many films, at the same time it shows the age of the franchise when they have run out of ideas. Music and sound design was alright. Stallone as much as he is good, he is old and we can clearly see him struggling thru things whole thing.

I would not have been surprised to have seen him using a zimmer frame to move around on, or perhaps a commode on wheels. Everybody Stallone shoot's dies, he gets shot twice and still run's around, and while I know criminals are stupid I cannot see them being as stupid as portrayed in this film.

Stallone still has plenty of fuel in the tank!,"Continuing on from where we last left Rambo with the fourth instalment in 2008, Rambo's past still haunts him, creating a ""War within his own mind"". While trying to seek peace Rambo is now living the farm life with a house keeper and her daughter. Needless to say, it isn't long until John Rambo is forced once again to use his combat and survival skills to dish out a bloody revenge one more time. Here our leading actor, Sylvester Stallone (who is 73 years old in real life) brings the action and popcorn entertainment successfully once again.

I personally have always found pure enjoyment whenever I watch a Rambo film. This is for sure because of the action factor, but I also generally care about this character. Naturally the 1st Rambo film is truly my all time favourite out of the previous 4 instalments.

For fun, here is the on screen body count for the previous Rambo films: * First Blood (1982) ‚ûñ 1 Kill * Rambo First Blood Part 2 (1985) ‚ûñ 69 Kills * Rambo III (1988) ‚ûñ 132 Kills * Rambo (2008) ‚ûñ 236 Kills

Without giving away spoilers, Rambo: Last Blood definitely feels like the film decided to focus more deeply on Rambo's character and go back to what worked best within the series: Revenge. I personally enjoyed this concept more than just another film trying to out do the body count from the previous film. That being said...

While the body count might be lower, there is still plenty of kills and I will advise that this Rambo film contain the MOST gore and blood and easily warrants the film's R18+ rating.

As for the plot, I really enjoyed the extension of John Rambo's character. Within the runtime, the film does well in providing a setup, generally getting right into it.

The plot here is slightly predictable at times and then at other times I found myself rather stunned and truly shocked as to what happens around Rambo's life. The film clearly takes some huge risks in the plot as well pushing the limits in regards to the film's action and gore. The action is believable and the fast paced shots are done very well. Credit also goes out the soundtrack and sound effects- hearing the amazing Rambo theme again brings a true smile to my face.

Overall, considering this is a fifth instalment to a series which began in 1982, the 72 year old actor Sylvester Stallone shows there is plenty of action fuel left in his tank. Rambo fans will be pleased with this film and the continued story of the character many love. Action junkies will also be pleased and shocked to find this new instalment contains even more gore and violence. I found all of this enjoyable and declare it is a worthy instalment to the franchise.

A Satisfyingly Brutal Finale!,"Rambo: Last Blood is the last movie of the Rambo franchise and O MY GOD it's amazing. It's the Logan (2017) of the Rambo Series and I was very impressed with everything about this Movie. The best film in the Rambo franchise since First Blood, the curiously titled Rambo: Last Blood injects the heart back into the legendary action franchise, before ripping it out with an awe-inspiring avalanche of violence that re-establishes Sylvester Stallone as an action hero with equal. If on screen kills are an art, that what Last Blood delivers is a masterpiece. A deluge of bloody ferocious brutality, delivered with trademark Sly snarl and thankfully shaky-cam free, the violence of Last Blood more than matches the recent output from other one-man army movies.

Suitably excessive in execution and wince inducing in its means, it's the kind of action filmmaking that hardcore fans would especially appreciate. Much like the Creed films, Rambo: Last Blood successfully replicates the heart and spirit of how its franchise operates at the best level. John J. Rambo is back, and the cinematic killing floor is his domain.",10.0,18 September 2019

I gave it 3 stars because the action sequences have some pretty cool moments but, besides that the movie is a waste of time.

Legitimately Good on all Fronts,"I actually think this is a very fitting send off. You don't really solve problems with the training you get in warfare. You get something else entirely. So when an adoptive daughter of Rambo's goes missing in Mexico looking for her dad, and he goes down there to insert himself into the problem, I actually think the entire outcome fits very eloquently with the entirety of the Rambo saga.

And what's even more fitting is that in a sort of Taken scenario, Rambo actually does, as we've established, have the skills to do this stuff. Whereas the other movies we have to suspend a lot of disbelief for those characters to pull off the stuff they do. It's actually really a smart direction and brings the character into the modern era in a way that feels more vivid and practical than the last movie.

The script is actually good as well! It's better written than most movies of this type. The acting is good, as good as these get. The action was fantastic and built up exceedingly.

Decent but not the Rambo most will be expecting,"With the trailers of the movie, most people were expecting a 'Home Alone, but with hacking and slicing'. While the 'hacking and slicing' part is a part of this movie, Home Alone it is not. The movie is decent, but falls short of what most fans would be expecting. Most would also feel there is not much case for the movie to be made. The movie starts off slow showing the bond he shares with those he's left with now. We see a part of Rambo we haven't seen before: he seems to have developed a soft area in the heart. It's like Rocky is temporarily there somewhere. Things pick up midway, and that is where the violence starts. We see Rambo become Rambo the personality and the excitement starts. The problem of the movie is that the 'Rambo' part of the movie is very less. Parts shot in Mexico seem like they belong in some other action movie and not this franchise. Action is filled with violence and gruesome scenes but everything seems to happen very quickly. Even the last act is so swift that it is all over before the viewers have got themselves ready. Overall, the direction of the movie seems all over the place. The good part of the movie is the acting. Sylvester Stallone does a fantastic job once again. His fear-invoking capability hasn't diminished. The side characters were good as well. The movie takes some very bold steps, which do give more weight to the story and the motivations behind the characters. This is where the movie shines.

There aren't many throwbacks to the previous movies. As we know from the trailers, there's no mullet, no headband. But there is some good stuff at the end credits which bring in nostalgia.

Overall, the movie is alright. Directing is probably where the flaws lie, but acting is good and the story is decent.",7.0,21 September 2019

Then she gets caught like a Liam Neeson film but thats where things go downhill with the plot. Rambo has 0 plans which very unusual for the character. He also chucks his pills away which seemed useless. The dialog was really really strange. Like at one point a lady he knows closely says ""my heart will be ripped out for the rest of my life"" and he is just like ""okay well take care"".. what the heck is that? The dialog is definitely the worst part of the film. The blood and gore however was the best, absolutely brutal and probably the most brutal out of all the Rambos and I've seen em all. The plot was weird and sad with no real direction or sub plots which makes things boring at times but still not horrible. It was an interesting enough film and definitely bad ass.

I wish I haven't Seen it!,"Rambo 5 shouldn't have been made as a graphic, revenge film! This is a huge mistake. In the previous films John Rambo, a highly skilled and brave soldier, never lost his humane side. In Rambo 5 he is savage- mutilating, decapitating, injuring with intend to cause maximum damage and pain. This is so far away from the fine human being with tortured soul, which Stallone created in the classic First Blood of 1982!

I loved John Rambo for his resilience, for his ability to push back when the world was tearing him apart! The ""new"", badly aged Rambo has lost that ability.

Rambo was an icon and a cause! Previously he spoke on behalf of the forsaken Vietnam war veterans and he spoke well. In Rambo 5 he is degraded and reduced to a weak, riddled with mental health issues, blood-thirsty monster. This is not my John J. Rambo. My one was fearless, heroic and dignified Man. He was a Defender!

In my heart Rambo died in 2008, in Burma. A bullet ended his life while he was defending the humanitarian missionaries from Colorado and the Karen triebespeople, gunning down the vicious Tint's army with M2 Browning machine gun.

Rest in Peace Honorable John J. Rambo!

P.S. 1 October, 2019. I just read a review by Somebodywhatever. He calls Rambo: Last blood - ""beautifully brutal"".

Well, there is no beauty in brutality. There is nothing worthy of adoration in decapitating people and pinning them with straws then cutting their hearts out. That is pure savagery. Sorry, but if this is the new norm for ""beautiful"" in US film-making, which seems to be the case, I say - stop the bus, I am off! And if this is what nowadays' American audience needs in order to feel excited - I distance myself as far as possible. I take your negative ratings of my review as COMPLIMENT!

A few words to Stallone. You are a smart and talented film-maker, Mr. Stallone. What made you do this disgraceful parody of Rambo action film, I don't want to know. But I would like to remind you that as prolific writer and actor, you have some responsibility to society and especially to the young ones who are watching your gore-feast of a movie. What do you teach them? What will you teach your future grand kids?

I will conclude my review with a quote by Ingmar Bergman - one of the most accomplished, acclaimed and influential filmmakers of all time: ""No form of art goes beyond ordinary consciousness as film does, straight to our emotions, deep into the twilight room of the soul.""

Keep that in mind, Mr. Stallone, before you decide to do another one type Rambo 5, brutality- laden, parody of a movie!",1.0,27 September 2019
"Guns, carnage, xenophobia - everything you could want from a Rambo movie; hugely entertaining","In the torrent of negative reviews that greeted Rambo: Last Blood, one that stood out was Richard Roeper's zero-star rant for The Chicago Sun Times, in which he said of the film, ""this is a gratuitously violent, shamelessly exploitative, gruesomely sadistic and utterly repellent piece of trash"". I agree with pretty much all of that sentence. And I loved it. But let me segue into asking a question. Which is the more ""responsible"" - the hard R-rated movie that makes no bones about its violent content, or the equally violent PG-13 movie that removes the gore but leaves the savagery? Last Blood is only moderately more violent than most of today's action blockbusters, but it's a damn-sight more honest in its depiction of the impact of violence on the human body. It's like the old joke about The A-Team (1983) - it didn't matter what the level of violence was, the fact that we never saw blood and never saw anyone die meant it was family entertainment. Last Blood is not family entertainment.

And it's awesome.

Now, make no mistake, it's no masterpiece. In fact, it's barely a movie at all (the script is so rudimentary, it rivals the dizzying complexities of ), and it's by far the least political entry in the Rambo franchise thus far. It's xenophobic. It may stoke irrational fears about the evils of Mexico and permeability of the southern border. It's a film in which Rambo doesn't just kill his enemies, he kills them several times just to be sure. It's a film in which on no less than two occasions, Rambo uses his bare hands to extract internal organs. It's a film that's an immensely enjoyable no-holds-barred revenge actioner that's about as interested in political correctness as it is in millennial angst. Which is to say, not even remotely.

And it's awesome.

It has been 11 years since Rambo () returned to his father's ranch in Bowie, Arizona. His father has died, but Rambo remains at the ranch, breaking in horses and sharing his home with live-in housekeeper Maria Beltran () and her teenage granddaughter Gabriela (), who he helped to raise. All is quiet until Gabriela is contacted from Mexico by her friend Gizelle (), who tells her she has located Gabriela's father Manuel (), who walked out on her and her dying mother when she was still a child. Although advised by both Rambo and Maria not to go to Mexico, she ignores their warnings. However, on her first night there, she is drugged and abducted by the Martinez brothers, Hugo () and Victor (). When Rambo comes looking for her, he earns a beating for his trouble, and so, realising he can't fight the cartel on their terms, he decides to lure them back to Arizona, where he can fight them on his.

Undeniably, for better or worse, the Rambo films have always found a way to tap into some of the major geopolitical issues of the era in which they were made. Introduced in 's superb 1972 novel, the character was brought to the screen 10 years later in . One of many Vietnam-vet-comes-home-and-is-rejected-by-society films made in the years following the end of the Vietnam War (1955-1975), it presented Rambo as an embodiment of the problems of unaddressed-PTSD. Made in the second year of Ronald Reagan's presidency, it argued that you can't create killing machines for use in a foreign war and then simply bring them home and expect them to reintegrate. The next two films also took place during Reagan's presidency, at a time when the wounds of Vietnam were still fresh, but the idea of American exceptionalism had started to morph into a kind of over-compensatory machismo. This saw Rambo transition from being an allegory for the struggles of vets to an embodiment of jingoistic Regan-era American militarism and juvenile wish-fulfilment (in the second film, , he literally gets a second crack at winning in Vietnam). In essence, he had changed from a symbol for the psychological damage of war to an undefeatable representative of American military might. The fourth film, , came out in the final year of George W. Bush's presidency at a time when the US (in no small part because of an illegal war) had once again risen to the position of global police force, although the fact that he's on a mission to save, of all things, Christian aid workers, is a bit on the nose even for this franchise.

Which brings us to Last Blood. Written by Stallone and , from a story by , and directed by , Last Blood comes in the fourth year of Donald Trump's presidency, and sees Rambo facing off against the bad hombres south of the border (they bring drugs, they bring crime, although some, he assumes, are good people). And with a border this porous (characters easily cross over with weaponry, drugs, dead bodies, and decapitated heads), the only person who can protect the US of A from such villains is Don J. Trumpo...sorry, John J. Rambo.

However, having said that, this is far and away the least political film of the franchise. Whilst the first and second both dealt with Vietnam, the third with the Soviet-Afghan war, and the fourth with the Myanmar Civil War, Last Blood doesn't explicitly deal with a real-world conflict and is not set in an inherently politicised milieu. And this ties into a crucial point - in moving out of the arena of politics, the storyline is more personal, which is important insofar as Rambo himself is presented somewhat differently, showing more emotion than we've seen from him since the opening few scenes of First Blood. The film also focuses on his PTSD, which had been relatively ignored in the three previous films. Here, not only is he shown as still suffering the effects, he actually leans into it, using his trauma to motivate himself. In this sense, the early parts of the film work extremely well - see Rambo in a home, we see him trying to keep his demons at bay, we see him, for arguably the first time, with something to lose.

However, for better or worse, the film's big selling point isn't the political allegory or the character's psychology - it's the action, the ""suit-up"" moment when Rambo unleashes hell. Here, the entire third-act is one long action scene, and it's entertaining enough to temper much of the political immaturity and distasteful stereotypes that lead up to it. Well shot by director Grunberg and cinematographer , it's kind of the inverse of the sleek action scenes found in the John Wick films - it's dark, gritty, and brutal, and whereas those films often create the impression of near weightlessness, here, it's the tangible physicality that works so well, the sense of visceral devastation that results from a particular impact rather than anything balletic.

Of course, a vital aspect of any Rambo movie is that a lot of what some people love will be the exact things that others despise. In this case, it's the laughably simplistic politics, the barely disguised xenophobia, the brutal violence, and the fetishisation of weaponry. On this last point, I can't recall, off the top of my head, another film which is so blatant in its glorification of guns, whether it's the long tracking shots of Rambo's collection of rifles, or the way the film lingers on the destruction they mete out.

The film's handling of the Mexican portion of the story is a good example of how you either decry the stupidity or celebrate the ridiculousness. The character of Gizelle, for example, dresses like the only research the costume department did was to watch , whilst poor Gabriela gets abducted after ONE night in Mexico. And as for the aforementioned porousness of the border, I'm not sure if it's appallingly lazy writing or satirical genius, but Rambo gets back into the US by finding a quiet section and ploughing his truck through the wire mesh fence. He wouldn't have been able to do that if there'd been a wall.

A criticism that I would treat a little more seriously, however, is that although this is supposed to be the last chapter in the franchise, there's no sense of finality. Nothing happens at any point where you could say to yourself, ""that seems a fitting send-off for the character"". In fact, the previous film felt more final than this one. Another problem is the script. Much as Rocky IV was two boxing matches loosely tied together by montages, Last Blood is 40 minutes of plot loosely connected to an extended action scene via, you guessed it, a series of montages.

Finally, it would be remiss of me not to mention David Morrell's opinion on the film. After seeing it, he wrote on Twitter, ""the film is a mess. Embarrassed to have my name associated with it"", and later he told Newsweek, ""I felt degraded and dehumanised after I left the theatre. Instead of being soulful, this new movie lacks one. I felt I was less a human being for having seen it.""

Make of that what you will.

In many ways, Last Blood is a hilariously bad film. But it's also a hugely entertaining film. Sure, the violence is off the chart and the politics are hilariously na√Øve at best, dangerously reductionist at worse. But it's extremely well shot, Stallone gives a predictably strong performance, the action is intense, and none of the problems are so large as to render the film unenjoyable. Approach it with the right frame of mind, and you'll find much to appreciate.",8.0,7 October 2019

Pointless and Borderline unnecessary,"I have no words to describe my complete and utter disappointment for this movie as I am a huge Rambo. I knew that this movie was going to suck even after watching the trailers. Because here me out people I'm with the critics on this one. But an opinion is an opinion.

Firstly, Rambo 4 had a definitive ending to the entire franchise. Rambo was finally cured of his PTSD, he had a cool colossal final battle and finally made his way back home. This movie was solely made just to cash in on the extreme nostalgia for this franchise. I hate this film not because it's xenophobic, but because the story is nonsensical, the action is boring and generic, the villains are lame and Stallone looks uninterested.

Secondly, the cinematography is terrible and looks like more like something that I would see on Television than from the cinema. Cgi effects, especially during the flood scene and gore effects, are terrible. I can just watch Cobra, Tango and Cash, Rocky 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, Rambo 1, 2, 3 and 4, Daylight, Cop Land, Cliffhanger, Demolition Man and Nighthawks anyday of the week.

Crappy dialogue, plot holes, Rambo and everyone around him are dumb, incredibly short screen-time?! Rambo goes to Mexico with a pistol, no preparation, no anything... Well, except graphic gore which there is plenty of. And probably is only one thing worth remembering. For better or worse.

He talks in a scratchy whisper and he is always in earnest, but he doesn't need a lot of acting range - he is a quintessential action hero.

Never knew there could be so many ways to 'off' somebody, but the denouement is worth it, even though most of the action comes at the end of the picture (be patient, bloodthirsty Rambo fans). Sit back and enjoy. You don't have to think for 80 minutes.

[6.8] Not doing justice to John Rambo as he is remembered,"The title is a movie, which screenplay and story begs for a not too lengthy review as it has basically little depth and runtime. Truly speaking, as a Rambo fan, I expected more of it, but was taken aback and disappointed.

The story is shallow and weak. Even in its current state, it could have been more elaborate and believable.
The runtime of the movie is not enough (whether cut or edited) and another 20-30 minutes would have been better suited, contributing more strongly to its quality.
The acting is nothing special overall and because of the weak story, it soon becomes forgettable.


So, if the minuses prevail so much, why does it get a rating of around ""7""; IMO, that's mostly because of the third and ending part of the movie and the action-packed revengeful scenes. Accounting all that, at the end, we have a movie with John Rambo in it, but lacking the feel and vibe of the Rambo movies, especially the 1982 and 1985 ones.

Old Rambo works for me,"So it's not that bad of a flick. Cause we are all thinking it. Sly is too old to play Rambo. It's not like with Creed cause Rocky is not in the ring. They got a younger guy to do the fighting and Balboa gets to be the mentor. John Rambo is still in the fight, and as unbelievable as it is that one man can go up ageist an army of cops, Vietnam refugees, Iraq rebels, etc... it's even harder when that same man is now a senior citizen, but what does make Sly a decent filmmaker is that fact that he knows this too. He's well aware that Danny Glover's famous catch phrase includes him. So he designed a movie base on that. John Rambo is fighting a fight he thinks he knows but he's entering a world that he knows nothing about. He gets tossed around and beat up proving that he's just a man (Although in real life if a 70-something year old man took this beating, he'd be dead), but in the end, Rambo proved that his best weapon is his mind (Despite how wacked out of it he might be)and used it to rage some action packed bloody hell. It's a quick time at the movies with a 60 min story about how Rambo found peace only to have it snatch away from him. Then it's 29mins of pure mindless violence that totally satisfies in a way only an 80s action hero can. Give mad credit to Stallone, he knows how to come back to a character. Despite a typical archetype of a story use to move the minutes along it was performed with a darkness that only a man who knows his character can do. It's a story that gets dark and it only makes Rambo's thrust for blood even better when he goes for vengeance. Have to admit if this is that last one he went out on a high point (especially if your were really into First Blood).",7.0,23 September 2019

When Gabrielle learns that her father, who left her mother and her, is living in Mexico, she decides to travel to visit him despite the advices of Rambo and Maria. She meets her friend Gizelle (Fenessa Pineda) and is disappointed with the encounter with her father. Gizelle invites Gabrielle to go with her to a night-club and she disappears. Rambo travels to Mexico looking for her and has to fight a gang of prostitution and trafficking with the support of the independent journalist Carmen Delgado (Paz Vega), who lost her sister to the traffickers.

""Rambo: Last Blood"" is the last action film of the character John Rambo. Sylvester Stallone is old but the good screenplay does not disappoint the fans of the franchise. The tension increases and the bad guys are punished as expected. My vote is six.

You 'aint seen nothing yet!,"Forget The Expendables, John is back and how!

Just when you may expect another RAMBO instalment to be moot considering the ferocity and seeming closure of the series with RAMBO in 2008, Stallone has marshalled a considerable range of new territory for the character to inhabit and executes it flawlessly.

A myth regarding the Rambo series is the often mentioned lack of character development which admittedly is not as obvious as the Rocky series, but throughout the first four instalments, John Rambo has indeed covered his progressive emotional and psychological development with incremental glimpses of the changes he is undergoing and it's never been underscored so beautifully with Rambo:Last Blood.

In an entirely new environment Stallone graces the audience with the opportunity to see Rambo among a family he loves and treasures immensely and never has his humanity and purity of spirit been better articulated. As a result, Stallone gives Rambo an unprecendented opportunity to be verbal and expressive rather than keep the occasional dialogue he would dispense in the earlier films. Whilst still haunted by the past; beautifully represented in one flashback; he has seemingly found the closest thing to peace in his life before the inevitable ""lid"" he's keeping on his demons is cast to the wind and he harnesses his considerable military abilities to enact a retatilation against those who destroy his new life.

The ridiculous notion of a Taken/Home Alone scenario unfolding is so far from reality as to be ridiculous. This is not just action at it's peak but a reveal of a man who has never fired the first shot or ever gone looking for war and when the time comes; on his own turf for a change; Stallone imbues Rambo an intensity that just should be impossible considering what we've seen in the past. There is method to his anger and catalysts for his carnage and eclispes everything we've seen the character do before.

Stallone has never been as affecting and vulnerable as John Rambo since the original and with that comes a few surprises for the audience. Stallone plays the role to perfection and graces us with another amazing performance that already has been sadly overlooked by the critics who simply consider the character itself to be not worthy of paying attention to regarding the more minute emotional aspects of the character.

Had the film not lived up to be what it was for me, I'd be blunt about it but for myself and the packed house, who didn't even move during the end credits, Rambo:Last Blood delivers on more than just the expectant action sequences and intense violence. This isn't war for war's sake and an excuse to pander to expectations for it to be gratuitous for the hell of it, there is a method to the perceived madness.

Stallone has done the RAMBO legacy proud with this latest film and all the rotten tomatoes and metacritics in the world cannot alter the fact that he has harnessed one of the finest motion pictures of his career.",10.0,19 September 2019
"The new Rambo film is a bit exaggerated, but entertaining.","Rambo: Last Blood is the latest film from the Rambo film series. This film is directed by Adrian Grunberg, the director of How I Spent My Summer Vacation.

In the film, John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) retired to his Texas ranch to spend his older days in peace. His niece Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal) tries to meet her father for the first time in Mexico, but here she ends up in the hands of a Mexican drug cartel, who engage in drugs and trafficking in women. When Rambo hears this, he decides to pick up his weapons and skills to save Gabrielle before she disappears into this dark criminal world.

This new Rambo film is a bit different compared to the previous Rambo films. In the earlier Rambo films, Rambo fought against corrupt military groups, but in this new film he fights against a drug cartel. The old trauma aspects of Rambo and the Vietnamese war veteran, for example, appear unnecessary in this film. Because of the different kind of story of this film, the film comes across as a mature mix of the films Taken and Home Alone, where an uncle tries to rescue his niece from criminals and tries to defeat these criminals with booby traps. The film is a bit exaggerated, but it is entertaining. For an action movie with a better story, you better stick to the first two Rambo films.

Sylvester Stallone still delivers appropriate acting work like an older Rambo. He did say that this will be the last Rambo film if this film is not successfully received. The rest of the cast does, however, provide less acting. Yvette Monreal seems a bit uncertain in this film with her acting work. She has also acted more in unknown film and TV series. This is the first major film in which she acts and this can be seen. Paz Vega plays a journalist in the film, but she doesn't do anything special about the role. The cast members who play the criminals sometimes look a bit exaggerated as characters from a cartoon.",6.0,20 September 2019
Don't listen majority of high rating reviewers suggest to you,"I admit, I hadn't have my hopes high on this film. To me, Rambo ended after the 3rd part and even that film along the previous film are inferior to 1982 classic original. I wasn't even expect 2008 film to be made, but there it was. Unfortunately, The Last Blood suffers from same problems. And it was insult to the franchise. Fairly ridiculously gory, violent, profane, depraved film with about 80 minutes of screen-time, excluding the end credits (which last for about 10 minutes). The build up is slow, and the it finishes real quick. Story makes no sense either. Also, there are some let's say, cringe pro-wahmen empowerment elements (you would think Rambo movies are allergic to those). In between, there are no any segments that made even 2&3 iconic - no jungle, no waterfall, no helicopters, no bandana... Not a single glimpse of Rambo we use to know from the 80s. Only onslaught of extremely graphic violence. Seriously, this is truly undeserving end for my hero.

Its really hard to talk about this movie without spoiling it as there is so much to spoil.

Judging by the trailers it was described as Taken meets Home Alone and that's what it turned out to be but don't let you put you off from this movie as it feels like a fresh new take on the Rambo franchise and every snowflake has it own design.

First Blood was the best Rambo movie as it had emotional content and character development then the rest of them were entertaining action movies and Last Blood stays true to the original. I'm really glad that they didn't make another war action movie with tanks and gunships as the previous three Rambo movies already did that. In this movie Rambo was using strategy over fire power just like the first one.

Before the release of this movie the original concept was ""Rambo V: The Savage Hunt"" where Rambo had to find and destroy a genetically engineered monster and was based on a novel called Hunter by James Bryon Hunter and Sly owns the rights for but didn't get green-lit, maybe because it was too similar to Predator. So I was really disappointed when I heard that as it was a fascinating concept but after watching this movie I think it was for the best.

The best thing about Rambo: Last Blood is that it makes you feel for the main characters which is what a lot of movies nowadays are failing to do and if you want nothing but brainless action then it's best avoided.",10.0,19 September 2019

But this movie was just about revenge. The entire movie had a slow build up, to finally lead to a couple of minutes of Rambo action; why wasnt it spread out into the film better? Taken had a better spread of action compared to this film! The most uncharacteristic part of the movie comapred to First Blood, is the gore.

"First blood, last blood, whatever ... There WILL be Blood!","I can summarize and recommend ""Rambo: Last Blood"" using just one simple anecdote, in fact. How many times have you seen an action film or thriller in which a character - any character - at some point yells: ""I'm going to rip your heart out!"". Many times, right? And how often does it also actually happen? Practically never! Well, here it does. That's the kind of franchise ""Rambo"" is. It delivers. When John Rambo says that he's going to rip your heart out, he does just that.

Oh boy, how I looked forward to this fifth installment! Over a course of 37 years, John Rambo became the ultimate personification of hard-boiled action, and my personal favorite Sylvester Stallone character. ""Rocky"" might be a more qualitative film series, and ""The Expendables"" might be aimed more at a popcorn-loving younger generation, but the lone and forever mentally struggling Vietnam veteran John Rambo is a personal hero. And even though this only turned out to be my third favorite film out of five (after the original ""First Blood"" and the 2008 comeback ""Rambo""), it's a fantastic thrill-ride that fully lived up to my expectations. John single-handedly goes to war against a Mexican prostitution and drug cartel when he learns they kidnapped his prot√©g√© ""niece"" Gabrielle, and subjected her to endless agony. When he can't defeat them on their own turf - and moreover loses the girl - Rambo goes good old-fashioned bonkers and lures them to his own playground ranch in Arizona. The final 15-20 minutes of ""Last Blood"" are indescribably violent, with our hero turning the tunnel network underneath his ranch into a booby-trapped war zone. Comparisons have been made between this film and the comedy classic ""Home Alone"", and it's not too difficult to see why, except - obviously - that these booby traps result in massively painful and blood-soaked deaths!

Movie with 2 faces,"Rambo: First Blood wasn't just an action movie. Foremost it was a movie about a Vietnam-veteran who struggled with PTSD and picking up his life in a hostile environment: post-Vietnam-war America. Rewatching the movie you see it's all about an ex-soldier who can't get the war out of his head.

Rambo 2 and 3 were completely different, making Rambo just another action-hero. The emotional development Rambo made in the first movie, was completely thrown overboard to make 2 of the best action-movies made in the '80's. I love them both, but in hindsight they seem really out-of-touch with the first movie.

In Rambo: Last Blood, we meet Rambo, back in America again. He tries to save some people from extreme weather-conditions, which leave him struggle again with all the people he knows from the war he couldn't save. We find out that Rambo is a surrogate-father for the 18 years old Maxican girl Gabriella. Gabriella goes out on a mission to Mexico, to confront her real father on why he left her and her mother. Rambo strongly advises her not to do that, but she sneaks to Mexico anyway. There she is taken by a mexican drugcartel who want to sell her as a hooker. Rambo goes on a rescue-mission to save her, after which the drug-cartel is coming to Rambo for revenge.

The first part of this film is quite emotional. There is some real bonding and chemisrty between Rambo and Gabriella. Rambo struggles again with the dark side of his mind and his distrust of society. The emotional first half is, unfortunately, nothing more than a set-up for the second part of the movie, which is full of great Rambo-action. The action is awesome, but doing nothing with the emotions from the first half, makes that it lacks tension. It is cool to see Rambo back in action again, but it doesn't make you feel for him really.

"If nothing else, it's entertaining","The story follows John Rambo who is living happily at a ranch, tending to horses with his niece Gabrielle. Wanting to know the truth about her estranged father, she travels to Mexico, where she finds herself in trouble. Rambo comes down to rescue her; a mission which leads to gang leader Hugo Martinez driving up to Rambo's home in search of revenge. What awaits the gang upon arrival however they could not have seen coming.

This film is very derivative and generic of many other revenge movies. The plot is fairly thin and ultimately predictable. Also the script is mediocre, to the extent that the cast really struggle to make much out of it, despite their best efforts. I think the most disappointing thing for me though was the editing - in particular the way in which the most violent scenes were cut incredibly quickly, almost as if to shield the audience from the gruesomeness of the lingering pain. There are plenty of inventive, violent kills; but because almost all of them are cut away from so quickly, that took a sick pleasure away for me. The cinematography is very good, some of the desert shots are really nice to look at and the score is fitting and complements the narrative very well. ¬∑

Overall, Rambo last blood is an unnecessary instalment in the Rambo franchise. The performances are good and the action are quite thrilling but the direction and script left much to be desired.",6.0,7 January 2021
This Ain't John J. Rambo Film,"I am a huge Rambo's fan. Loved the character since the first installment of 1982. But Rambo 5 has almost nothing in common with John J. Rambo from First Blood and the later versions - 2,3 and 4.

In Rambo: First Blood, John J. Rambo was a highly efficient Green barrette who had the misfortune to be on the wrong place in the wrong time and to meet the wrong people. He was pushed to the edge and fought his way back. But he wasn't savage and used violence only to stop violence, not for revenge. Things got a bit messy in the second, third and fourth series. Still, Rambo killed only military personnel in a combat. He never lost his humanity until the fifth and supposedly last installment. Here he is brutal. He is savage. He uses his extraordinary combat skills for revenge. This is not the essence of John J. Rambo's character. That can be anybody else action character but not Rambo.

I want to say a few more words about his physical appearance. Rambo 5 is ugly! He is so unattractive, it's hard to watch him. Whoever designed his make up, should be ashamed of themselves.

If you have loved John J.Rambo's character, my advice is to skip the fifth installment. Rambo 4 had decent ending - he went home! I would have loved if he had died a hero and had a respectful send off by the state. That would have been my perfect ending of the saga. But I have accepted Rambo 4 ending. However, I cannot accept Rambo 5 finale - it's dumb. It opens opportunity for another film, which is bad idea. Stallone is too old to play an action hero. One must know when to sing one's Swansong! For Sly the deadline has passed long ago.",1.0,26 September 2019
Stallone as Rambo is once again laser focussed and delivers great action!,"This was a solid Rambo movie and delivers all the action of the others. Rambo is older now and he has little time for any of the bad guys.

I do feel the movie could have been a bit longer to offer more information and develop some of the characters a bit more. A lot of the fight scenes were fast and ended quickly but there is a satisfaction in the way he went about it.

Crappy scripted no-brainer,"The first thing I have to say is the non-stop totally irrelevant unengaging soundtrack played out from the start to the end. The stupid generic music is even worse than all of the bad soundtracks in Disney's cartoons, just so annoyingly horrible. Secondly, this movie was poorly edited, lot of the scenes are like a poorly patched work not quite necessary. Thirdly, so predictable one way plot and scenarios. The fighting scenes in the underground tunnels although quite brutal but based upon what we've seen in Rambo franchise were just so formulaic and numb to watch.

After so many plastic surgeries, S.S. seems to become an under-bite zombie, not quite comfortable to watch, on par with Michelle Obama's under-bite facial structure when she moved into the White House. In summary, this movie is so boring that absolutely not worth paying expensive ticket to watch in the movie theater, better awaits its DVD release.",,18 September 2019
By no means a bad film,"Considering how many recycled franchises Hollywood puts out now this is definitely above par. Without being a classic it's well acted, not absurd and has a fairly solid plot. The problem for the critics is probably that it's not your typical Rambo film. He's an old man now no longer a one many army but he's forced into a situation he doesn't want in much more believable circumstances than some previous Rambo films. What you get pulls no punches after a fairly slow start and is probably more in line with the original film than the first two sequels.",7.0,22 November 2019
John Rambo versus Mexican gangsters,"I am 20 years old and since I can remember I watched Rambo movies with pleasure.

And it's just like that:a massacre.

You may like it, but this movie won't deliever the same feeling as the classics. It's much more superficial. It's literally the only movie in which John Rambo wants to kill.

The dialogue is rolling right and the plot is refreshing while exploiting the best of the main character. Frankly I'm hoping he'll continue with another Rambo film just to defy us all. It's as much about intelligence as strength and endurance. The modern effects are also superior to the older movies in the Rambo collection.

RAMBO OUT TO AVENGE THE TRULY DUMB...!,"The last (I hope) in the long running series which began in 1982 comes to an end & while I wish Stallone would've shown a bit more restraint in this last hurrah, he doesn't. Rambo, now a horse breeder in Arizona, has been living w/a niece & her aunt (played by Oscar nominee Adriana Barraza) who is about to go away to college. She still has some unanswered questions on why her errant father left the household in the first place so she decides to cross the border to find him w/the help of a friend (who both Rambo & the aunt warn of her shaky character). No sooner than you can say ""I told you so"", the niece is betrayed by the friend who is sold into sex slavery. Rambo manages to track her down (after he gets the stuffing beat out of him & given a scar to boot by the reigning sex traffickers) but she's already in the final throes of heroin abuse succumbing to it as Rambo returns back home but not before he kills one of the brothers who branded him sending the surviving sibling to gather a strike force to wreck havoc on Rambo at his heavily fortified farm. What follows in the final act is a prolonged exercise in over the top gore not much seen in today's multiplexes which if the story weren't so Neanderthal in construction & execution would've made for a boneheaded but entertaining yarn. Seeing scenes from the previous entries running during the end credits is nice (especially since I never saw the first film on the big screen) but other than that, this is a film only for the most cherished masochists out there.",2.0,10 October 2019

First blood will always be the Rambo that we all felt for and still love to this day. 2 & 3 were 90s action films and they fall into that category comfortably. Rambo (4) was a film full of violence that we rarely see on screen and a darkest desires begged for it. Last blood blends the heart of first blood and the violence of Rambo yet doesn't succeed. Johns character is defined by his past but we don't feel it like we used to. The stakes are high but only for a character we have moments to connect with. What her character goes through is that of nightmares but we aren't pulled in like we were with johns plights in first blood. Unfortunately we just don't care as much. This is where last blood doesn't land it. Where it does get it right is with recreating the giddy violence of Rambo. Although stripped down to a basic ""come get me"" affair the violence really is what shines. The brutality is up there's with the best of Rambo and moments of just ""wow, really.

THE WORST of all the Rambo movies!,"This will be blunt.

I just saw Rambo: Last Blood.

It is THE WORST of all the Rambo movies. It is so bad, just by existing, it actually elevates movies 2 & 3 to a higher rating.

As xbs2034 noted earlier, the movie is missing a middle act. It's also missing any semblance of a logical script. We are parachuted into a sort-of family dynamic on Rambo's farm that is barely explained, if at all. We are led to believe Rambo has lived a peaceful, serene and danger-free lifestyle on the farm for many years by this point. A plot point, created by a character we just met and don't care about, ends this serenity. The middle act is then skipped over, in favor of a violent third act that is so over the top, and often times, outright illogical, that it makes any of Rambo's previous adventures seem like high art by comparison.

The movie ends as abruptly as it began, having proven to the world it was totally unnecessary, and a waste of, thankfully, ONLY 89 minutes of your life you will not get back.

That Rambo: Last Blood currently has a 7.2 rating just goes to show how easily impressed some movie watchers can be.

Rambo as God,"""Want to live? Follow the light!"" Rambo told the final boss. Every villain is given a chance to live or die, and each choice has its consequence.

While the graphic violence at times was difficult to watch, the excellent character development is what appeals to me the most. The movie does a great job in showing the very good reason that explains why Rambo went nut and the mysterious woman who seems to have saved Rambo for no apparent reason.

JEER - (4 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...

""Rambo: Last Blood"" comes 11 years after the previous 2008 entry into the franchise, ""Rambo"". That film was toted as a bookend to the Rambo series, so I was a little surprised to see this movie come out. Sly has been busy in those 11 years between these Rambo films having done all three Expendable movies, both Creeds, all three Escape Plans, and other works as well. And now he's back once again as the very, noticeably aged John Rambo.

This time, he is home on his father's ranch which he is sharing with his old friend, Maria Beltran, and her granddaughter, Gabriela. Not only has he opened his home to them, but his heart as well ... viewing Gabriela as a daughter. When Gabriela's biological father is found south of the border, the temptation is too great and she travels to confront him and find out why he left her - even though both Rambo and Maria sternly warn her against it. In time, Rambo finds out that she has gone missing in Mexico and he straps on his weapons and goes to find her.

This entry finds Rambo more angry and embittered than ever. In fact, I had a hard time believing that his character had become so crass and blood thirsty. What Rambo had to do in the past was out of necessity. For survival. For his friend's survival. But in this film, he crosses the line of necessity, to such acts of brutal violence, that it made no sense. I admit the ""home alone"" booby traps he has set up at the end of the movie were cool in parts. However, there were a few parts that were so over-the-top in his personal vendetta that made me believe that Rambo is really no better than his victims are.

I did not enjoy this film. It was clearly made just because it could be - not because it should be. I felt the previous film was a fitting ending to the character of Rambo. I no longer like or care for John Rambo anymore. He needs to retire. For good. So sad that I am even having to say that, but there you have it. Only 4 stars out of 10.",4.0,29 December 2019

A moderately satisfying send-off to a character Stallone has played so iconically for all these years,"Rambo: Last Blood is the fifth installment of the Rambo franchise starring Sylvester Stallone in the lead role. Directed by Adrian Grunberg , it is a moderately satisfying send-off to a character Stallone has played so iconically for all these years.

After returning to the United States from Myanmar, John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) has settled down on a farm with his close friend Maria (Adriana Barraza) and her granddaughter Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal). Despite continuing to battle with his inner demons, John enjoys his new life, finding particular solace in bonding with Gabrielle and becoming something of a step-uncle to her. One day, Gabrielle drives to Mexico to look for her birth father, despite John's strong assurance that he is not worth seeking out. When Gabrielle fails to return home, John sets off to search and hunt down those responsible for her disappearance.

In spite of a highly predictable plot, Rambo: Last Blood still contains just enough action to entertain long-time fans of the series as well as any potential newcomers. One thing to remember is that the Rambo films weren't popular due to their storylines but instead for the characterisation of John Rambo as a person and the way he deals with his PTSD, that and some good old fashioned shooting up of the bad guys of course. Surprisingly though, there are some nice emotional scenes of drama involving Rambo and his niece, which makes the audience care for her when he is attempting to rescue her. Much like the fourth film, this one contains jarring depictions of graphic violence and gore, however, it is far less frequent this time around but still worth noting. Sylvester Stallone, even in his 70s, still manages to play a convincing action hero, using his brain rather than simply his brawn. Like with Rocky Balboa in Creed II, this was a nice way to draw John Rambo's character arc to a conclusion, as Stallone has gone on to say that this film will be the final time he plays him. Whether or not we will see John Rambo again in the future is anyone's guess but at this point, I am quite happy with what we have gotten so far.

I rate it 7/10",7.0,19 September 2019

Violent and action packed but still misses the essence,"Rambo: Last Blood is an action movie directed by Adrian Gr√ºnberg and stars Sylvester Stallone, Paz Vega, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Adriana Barraza, Yvette Monreal and √ìscar Jaenada.

The movie is a revenge story with lots of violence, watch movie for more info.

The movie is undoubtedly very violent and action packed with Stallone coming in his old avatar, the first half of the movie is good as it sets up the base nicely but as soon as the movie progresses the movie started getting pale and becomes more of a one man tale. The movie lacks character introduction of the other characters and everything is shown in very hush hush manner.

The plot and storyline is predictable but screenplay is tight. Action and stunts are great. Acting by Stallone is impressive but other characters lacks the depth probably because the characters are not made up perfectly.

Going by the climax it seems that this is the final movie of the franchise but honestly the Rambo will be missed.

Must watch for Rambo and Sylvester Stallone fans",6.0,6 April 2020
"Ah well, it is what it is","No, this is not what any Rambo fan expects of the franchise. Compared to the previous Rambo movie, this doesn't live up to expectation on any level. As far as I do not want to write a rant, there are some really horrible aspects to this film. First 15 minutes leave you waiting for the plot to tighten, hopes high for a nice twist in directing and editing. Doesn't happen, though, sorry. The script might have been saved by good directing and editing, but I couldn't help myself feeling like watching a C class movie from back in the day. The score doesn't help as well - music, playing a huge role in creating the right atmosphere and vibe, fails dramatically here, leaving the viewer with a feeling of cheap orchestra-esque experience, far from what we are used to nowadays. Getting back to the plot - I honestly do not mind a script that could be written on a napkin (if it's an action movie) provided the director sells it wells and the outcome is decent. Here, it's so not Rambo-style and it simply fails to deliver. It feels cheap, over simplified and stupid. The characters are not built convincingly, you do not feel any connection whatsoever to all the non-Rambo folks appearing on the screen. Last comment about the violence - seems absolutely unnecessary and doesn't bring anything to the table. It's just there, not realy gore, but leaving the viewer with mixed feelings. As I do not want to spoil the ending to anyone willing to watch this, I will leave the finale without any comment.",3.0,2 January 2020

A Great Conclusion to the Ballad of John Rambo,"Rambo: Last Blood is a seemingly fitting end to the legend of John Rambo. According to the lore of the film series, Rambo is now 72 years old. After having gone through may traumatic experiences around the world, we find him retired at his family's horse ranch where he is the last living member of the Rambo family. There he spends his days raising horses, forging decorative knives in his underground bunker, and take care of his adopted daughter, Gabby, the grand-daughter of his platonic friend and ranch worker, Maria Beltran, who spends her days serving as the de-facto matriarch. Rambo isn't as physically fit as he once was, and it's clear that the events of Vietnam, Myanmar, Afghanistan, etc...have physical and psychological damaged him; he relies on daily doses of medication to keep the hallucinations at bay, and to prevent his PTSD from affecting his thinking. This film shows us a John Rambo who is a vulnerable old man struggling to bury his demons, and who keeps himself isolated on a remote farm for the sake of others as well as himself. The only thread that keeps his humanity intact is his innocent adopted daughter and his need to provide her with safety and security.

However that thread is severed when Gabby goes to Mexico in search of answers from her biological father, against Maria and John's wishes. Events take a turn for the worst when she encounters a Mexican cartel that deals in drugs and forced prostitution. This event awakens the long dormant killer buried deep within Rambo.

While the action sequences of the film seem implausible at times, they are, in fact, keeping with the tradition of unflinching brutal violence depicted throughout the Rambo franchise. Though to be clear, Rambo takes no pleasure in his acts but carries them out as raw and emotional responses to the attacks perpetrated against his struggle for humanity. Earlier in the film he says, ""I know how black a man's heart can be"" and this is the theme that is carried throughout the film. When you remove his humanity and the things that keep him grounded, he becomes a violent beast.

Sylvester Stallone is, as usual, amazing in his role as John Rambo. He has worn his age well and this affects his portrayal of Rambo. Paz Vega is also in this film but you'll only see her for about 20 minutes in total. Adriana Barazza was excellent as Maria Beltran. I would have liked to have seen more from her, but her scenes were done very well. Cinematography, Art Direction, Script....it all fits together so well. This is the best conclusion to John Rambo that we could have gotten. It is raw, emotional, and doesn't sugarcoat the extremely dark and ugly nature of violence and crime.

Overall, an excellent film. I give this a 7 out of 10.",7.0,24 November 2019

Old Man Rambo Will Tear You Apart,"Woah! The Metacritic score for this 5th Rambo movie is at 29/100. What is wrong with these critics? We had so much fun with this that it's criminal. Even the couple sitting behind us were cheering when the scumbags drop like flies. That's how you make a revenge flick.

I like Rambo's world - there's no gray, only black and white. If you are not a good person, you deserve to die in the hands of John Rambo. There is not much of a story here, the plot is paint-by-the-numbers, but I didn't care. If you want Academy Awards stuff go buy a ticket to see Ad Astra. Me? I just want to see lots of dead bad guys. Woah! I see deep fried bad guys, bad guys on satay sticks and bad guys perforated with more holes than your talcum powder holder. It's hammer time! And I mean that literally. It was so fun swimming in a bloodbath (I am making an appointment with my shrink after I post this) and this is the worst tourism movie featuring Mexico. The whole country basically only had 2 good persons and I love how simple it is to draw a bad guy. If you have tattoos, wear singlets, have bulging muscles, wear chunky necklaces, have an automatic stuck in your waist band, have a leery moustache, rape girls with your eyes and talk with bad grammar, you are a f$cking bad guy. If only the world is so easy to spot a bad guy.

Cheap thrills,"Just to be clear, I believe First Blood to be an absolute classic, followed by the enjoyable popcorn flick sequels.

This film however plays on some VERY deep and dark themes with all the finesse of a drunk orangutan firing a machine gun on full auto, purely as a cheap setup for a grotesque final act for Rambo to dish out his flavour of a sadistic Home Alone fantasy.

An altogether unnecessary film which has more in common with horror films Saw & Hostel than it does with any classic action franchise.

But we as audiences r aware that our Rambo is an expert in guerrilla warfare, he is best with guns, with knives, with his bare hands. A man who's been trained to ignore pain, ignore weather, to live off the land, to eat things that would make a billy goat puke. A man who is more better the The Collector in setting booby traps.

Finale to the iconic action hero (probably!),"Sylvestor Stallone reprises for the umpteenth time one of his iconic roles, and again it's reputedly the last one for this character but don't bet on it.

However, don't let that put you off this one, as to my genuine surprise this was a very enjoyable action pic. Admittedly, nothing too original but Stallone brings a gravitas to the ageing weary warrior that actually works here as our man sets out to get revenge.

Troublesome as always is the cliche of foreigners, in this case is Mexicans, but this is Hollywood and take it only as representing their villains and nothing more than that. Once rivalries are set, the body count & violence is sky high, but still very good in an old 1980s action style.

I came to watch this when it was on the tele not expecting anything of note, and am instead eating humble pie. There's nothing awe inspiring but it's a fine tribute to the John Rambo character which had been mostly ruined by some of the prior sequels.

Hope they don't do some prequel, just leave it all there now. However, if this is on the TV schedule give it a go, you'll be pleasantly surprised.",7.0,18 March 2022

"Huge Stallone fan, but this one could have better.","Well, here we are. Rambo 5. I was really looking forward to this one, but it turned out to be the worst of the 5.

What I truly don't understand about Stallone, is why he so often chooses not well known directors for movies he stars in. Maybe cause Rambo came from his own productionstudio Balboa productions he wanted to keep costs low, but still... with a great director on board, this could have been so much more. Same goes for the story, which is just a bit thin. It feels like an 80's movie with no big budget. While it just as easily could have been a rocksolid 2019 blockbuster.

The first hour is, well... uhm, a setup for the last half hour. Go see for yourself. But in all honesty, the first hour could be skipped.

The action is brutal and ""fun"" to watch if you are into hardcore action. Fair enough. But still,when u leave the theatre u are left with this feeling that it all could have been so much better.

It's just an actio flick now, not an epic part 5.

"Rambo, Bad Blood","Rambo is a certified classic and the sequel raised the game by telling an equal story about how even with awareness, we turn our back on POW's. The 3rd movie stunk, but that' what happens when Stallone gets too much input on a project. The Rambo reboot was a strong return to the franchise and was everything you could or would expect from the series. The latest addition, Rambo, Last Blood is a horrible sequel trying too hard to be a version of Taken, wish a kiss of I Spit On Your Grave thrown in, than a Rambo film. The only recognizable talent in the film is Stallone, and the film is full of less than talented actors portraying less than likeable characters.

To compensate for this boring lack of originality, this film is injected with hyper violence that honestly came off as laughable. Not only was the violence unrealistic, blood splatter and visual effects looked so digital that it appears it was all done on a Windows XP system.

Rambo Wins - Fatality,"Just as you'd anticipate, the core of the finale of Rambo is violent revenge. Last Blood seems to borrow the concept of Taken, only approaching the themes of sexual slavery and human trafficking in a different style, but still seeking a solid sense of vengeance. In the end, it's a brutally appealing way to detach from the Rambo movies, and a bloody awesome way, too.

At 73 years of age, Sylvester Stallone surprisingly still manages to provide the ass-kicking protagonist we've seen before, only with an older appearance. In a way, it kind of makes him even more iconic and stylish when we witness him committing extremely the brutal revenge he calls: ""exactly what it feels like"". His character alone will impress everyone.

Story-wise, it'll kind of remind people of Liam Neeson's Taken, with the main issue relating to a character known in John Rambo's life being kidnapped and sold for sexual purposes. Until the incidents begin to happen and entertain the audience, it's devoted to getting to know Rambo's current life and setting us into the plot. It's actually well-crafted, the vengeful action is insane and there's a solid antagonist.

The violence had me in absolute amazement, I laughed a lot at the absolute brutality of it. It was so damn funny satisfying. Stallone isn't breaking new ground here. But he is really convincing as a psychopath.

2019s Rambo: Last Blood,"Keeping this review short and sweet, because I think we all know who John Rambo is, and my non-horror reviews are shorter. So, here we go with Rambo: Last Blood.

What a fun way to finish the franchise. It was over the top, ridiculous, gory as hell, and super fun. The story was lacking in a few ways, but you know what? I don't care. I had fun! There was great fun gore! Better on-screen kills than most horror movies this year, so thanks for that!

I was laughing out-loud in the theater, which made some people start laughing around me. So that was fun. I love when I can just enjoy a movie, and not care about a good and deep story, and watch bad dudes get killed in a really brutal way. But Sly did good, and Yvette Monreal was a new actress for me, and she did a great job as well.

I am curious of what the future of the franchise could be though due to the footage during the credits. Could we be heading the direction of Creed? I certainly hope so!

So, to the naysayers, or those that can't lighten up: shoo. Don't take things so seriously. Yeah, the first Rambo movie is grittier and really a good story, but look at the other ones. They were just fun. And I had fun, and don't care what anyone else things.

First blood to last blood...there's buckets of it..,"Rambo Last Blood Cert R Run Time 89mins

Now before I start, I must confess that I do have a soft spot for old Sly and when I say old, I mean old. At 73 this is a more reflective John Rambo.

I was a big fan of First Blood the denouement of a damaged soldier cast aside by the society he fought for, I thought that this was particularly poignant. The following three films were diluted down to cartoon superhero vs foreign baddies. I found them a bit like a pot noodle, tasty but ultimately lacking substance.

In this film he's back in the old USA, has found himself a small ranch, a Hispanic housekeeper and has become a surrogate father to her young granddaughter.

In his spare time, he likes to train horses, have war flashbacks, build tunnels and fashion big eff off knives... (imagine that as your profile on Match!)

So, without spoilers, the young girl decided to go to Mexico to find her real father and this is where the trouble starts.

The story, such as it is, then leads him on a rescue mission into drug cartel land. The finale takes place back at his ranch where those naughty Mexicans, who went under a tunnel in Trump's wall, turn up to marmalise our mate John. Cue what appeared to me to be a very messy version of Home Alone. Each baddy is dispatched in a more and more inventive fashion with home made killer traps. They are so good in fact I think I'll design one for my shed... Crimewatch my %rse.

Oh, and yes, he does get to use his bow and arrow.

This is a slow starter of a movie and be warned there are a lot of subtitles when John gets down to Mexico.

In conclusion originality is missing from this film, and when boiled down is nothing more than a generic revenge story. What rises it above, slightly, is the nostalgia felt for the character and Mr. Stallone. This may be Last Blood but there Is certainly buckets of it...",7.0,21 December 2019
Seeking a place he could call home.,"Well directed, good editing, good casting and acting. If you enjoyed the previous outings then this is for you. Ignore the critics, don't take it seriously. The action is violent and gory, very graphic. Simple plot to follow, keeping you instrested throughout. Good CGI and explosions.

I like the fact stallone is narrating, which gives more feel to the character after decades.

Overall a good action sequel. Enjoy.

In his mind the war never ended...and now he's angrier than ever,"The fifth film in the Rambo series starts like a drama and at first feels a bit distant to the franchise. But when the going gets tough the Rambo gets going. Similarly to the fourth installment, this one too is very serious and even pessimistic in tone, and the violence is...very violent. Don't expect an easygoing feel-good movie because it's quite somber and nasty. But if you're a fan of hard edged revenge stories, oh boy...this is it.

At first I thought this is an unnecessary sequel after the great fourth film, but then it finally wrapped up pretty good. Even though it's not set in actual war zone this time, the story still illustrates the Rambo character just like we know him. He just wants to live a peaceful life but when things go wrong he turns into a killing machine. Some have argued that he's even too aggressive in this film but that's just because he has a personal vendetta, and I think all his rage and trauma he tries to keep inside just explodes as he puts everything in his possibly last battle.

The action scenes are good but not the best possible. It looked like the budget for the filming locations and sets has been quite limited. Other than that I didn't find much to complain. Maybe if you are obsessed with jungle, then you might get disappointed, but this is Rambo in a different setting and I think it's interesting to see this too.

Even though this film is a bit different entry in the Rambo series it's not bad at all. I like especially Stallone's acting because I think he's became a better actor in his later career and he can put more depth into the Rambo character nowadays. Recommended for vigilante type action movies and Stallone fans.",6.0,22 September 2020

A sunset for Rambo,"It makes sense for John Rambo to get one last dance on the silver screen. He defeated Afghanistan (Rambo III), returned all the Vietnam POWs (Rambo II), destroyed a Burmese village (Rambo IV), and evaded arrest in the state of Washington (Rambo I).

The final installment suggests from the opening scene that this will be a ride off into the sunset, as Rambo performs dressage on a lonesome Arizona ranch near the Mexican border. It's a simpler life, away from the dark hearts of bad people yet still within driving distance of the Mexican version of Mos Eisley. Not all is well, as we learn Rambo still suffers from PTSD, something he keeps at bay with prescription drugs, a stark contrast with William Munny from Unforgiven, who avoided whiskey to keep his demons at bay.

Rambo finds quietude on the ranch not only through dressage, but also through tunnel construction and repair. The tunnels lie hidden beneath the Arizona sun, providing a place to truly get away from it all.

Rambo V gathers elements from many movies: Taken, Unforgiven, Oldboy (2003), Straw Dogs, The Godfather Part III, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, The Counselor, and Home Alone. Sometimes it really is one man against the world, a man who needs the love of women and the addresses of the men who hurt them.

Rambo rightly serves up little dialogue, saving his bon mots for voice-over soliloquies, like a John Wayne Hamlet, a metaphor for an old rocking chair and the Downfall of the American Dream. Rambo stands for what is right, even if his methods are unorthodox or unsound. Or perhaps Rambo is the ultimate anarchist, with his penchant for punching holes in walls?",6.0,2 October 2019

"Homage to himself, this film is more brutal than the other Rambos",,6.0,14 May 2022
A depressing exercise in sadism that revels in its own oppressive misery and nihilism,"Vietnam veteran John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) has returned home to his father's ranch in Bowie, Arizona where he now lives with old friend Maria Beltran (Adriana Barraza) and her college bound granddaughter Gabriela (Yvette Monreal). Gabriel has attempted to reconnect with her estranged father despite the advice of her adoptive uncle John and her grandmother. When Gabriella's friend Gizelle (Fenessa Pineda) locates her father in Mexico, Gabriella heads across the border without telling Rambo or Maria. After being rejected by her father Gizelle takes her clubbing unaware Gizelle has a deal with a local pimp with ties to sex traffickers the Martinez Brothers, Hugo (Sefio Peris-Mencheta) and Victor (√ìscar Jaenada), and Gabriela is soon kidnapped. Rambo upon learning of Gabriela's disappearance crosses the border intent on bringing her back.

Following the relative success of 2008's Rambo, Sylvester Stallone hinted he was open to a sequel only for the film to be stuck in development hell. The film began with the pitch of Rambo squaring off against a Mexican criminal cartel to rescue a kidnapped girl back in 2009 only for the script to change at one point to Rambo squaring off against a rogue supersoldier loosely based on the science fiction novel Hunter by James Byron Huggins, Stallone saying he was ""done"" with the character of John Rambo in 2010, a Rambo TV series pitch that fizzled out, and finally circling back to the exact same pitch they'd started with back in 2009 making all the talk of other incarnations/directions a complete waste of time. The movie made $90 million against its $50 million budget (not including marketing) but has no doubt broken even with ancillaries from cable and streaming. The movie received negative reviews by critics and even audiences were more cooled in their attitudes to the series in comparison to 2008's Rambo. Rambo: Last Blood positions itself as something of a capper to the franchise, but instead of being a culmination of the character it instead exists as an excuse to revel in ugly brutal and depressing sadism which the movie mistakes for the provocative edge of First Blood.

At it's core, Rambo: Last Blood is essentially diet Taylor Sheridan with the movie playing like a lesser version of Sheridan's scripts like Wind River and Sicario if they were filtered through the lens of Death Wish II. The movie tackles the subject matter of human trafficking with about the same amount of respect as you'd expect from an 80s Charles Bronson movie (not surprising as Millennium is heir apparent to Cannon Films) and Last Blood is just an exploitation film using its charged controversial subject as window dressing for sadistically violent sequences. As dumb as Rambo: First Blood Part II and Rambo III were, I'd much rather watch either of those films over Last Blood because at the very least they were endearingly stupid rather than grotesquely depressing. Last Blood is barely a Rambo movie and frankly it feels so detached from the character's core you could remove Rambo's name and characteristics and just make it a generic revenge thriller.

I really didn't like this movie. First Blood may have given us a provocative and brutal action thriller that set the stage for many films of the 80s, but aside from brief signs of life in 2008's Rambo the series has become a shadow of its former self as it succumbed to high octane low thought action movie excess that was enduringly stupid in the 80s but has left behind that campy action movie excess in exchange for sadistic violence that the movie thinks puts it in the same league as the original First Blood. Rambo: Last Blood is a film indicative of a series that has become way too long in the tooth and needs to be put out to pasture.",4.0,20 June 2022
"Excellent Rambo, necessary but unecessary as well","I don't want to give away spoilers so I won't.

I do feel this needs to be seen, to see how Rambo ends up and also what happens in the later parts of his life. I feel, some parts could have been differently but I understand, Stallone wanted to give a message.

Throughout the Rambo films, there is talk about how difficult the war situation is, how much it damages people and they can't return from this. This message is taken to everyday life in the end. That life is a battlefield and we have to tread carefully.

Stallone could have ended all this happily and pleasantly but he wanted to say something and for that, it is important to watch the film.

I see people here disliking it for the film elements, they subjectively disagree with but at times, you need to look for what a film wants to say and follow that.",,15 September 2020
I have changed my mind on this film again!!!,"In 2008 when the 4th Rambo came out i thought it would be a joke. It turned out to be a really solid Rambo film and also a great ending to the John Rambo story. But no, commerce called again and Last Blood comes out. I was wary when i read what the story was about but i would give it a chance. I grew up loving the Rambo character. Sylvester Stallone had done such a good job ending the story that I thought that Last Blood wouldn't measure up. It doesn't as a Rambo film. Last Blood just feels like Taken with John Rambo in it.

The film feels more like a more violent version of Taken. Rambo is now at home living quietly. He has an adoptive niece who he cares very much that goes into. Mexico and is tricked into prostitution. Rambo goes after her and you can imagine what happens. The truth is that even though the film is engaging it just doesnt feel.like a Rambo film. Again, it is more Rambo does Taken. Giving the character someone to.care about is fine but the setting just didn't feel right. Sylvester Stallone is ok in the role, having more dialogue in this film than in any of the others. But I just kept thinking it was not working as a Rambo film. The action is very gritty and violent in the beginning but the last action scene is so over the top that it feels more like a horror film ending I understand that Sylvester Stallone is in his 70's and he can't do the long hair with the headband thing in the jungle. It is a revenge film, and that's fine. The character has something in his life that is finally good and it's taken away. But this is well covered territory. And frankly this story has been done much better before. The last Rambo film was very violent, but engrossing and the tone was right. This film starts off very well but completely goes off the rails in the 3rd act. But as much as I think it's a subpart Rambo film I still enjoy it.

For those who have watched the previous 4 installments and expecting high on this Last Blood, you won't feel satisfaction. Too much of family drama in the first 30 minutes and lack of character development are the main causes of disaster.

However, one thing I need to appreciate is the last action scenes. Rambo's trick to tame and take down the villains is quite engaging and most scenes are brutal enough. Other than this, Last Blood is just an average movie.",5.0,18 September 2019

Not a convincing Rambo story,,4.0,6 October 2019
"Remarkable, albeit could have been more","Rambo(Stallone, adding a new dimension to an already nuanced character) has spent the 11 years since we last saw him, on the family farm that we were shown him arrive at. What we didn't know before this was what he did there: he helped raise a bright and driven young woman, Gabrielle(Monreal, charming when she isn't being frustratingly naive). This helped bring out the humanity that we knew was in him, but had been buried pretty deeply for the 3 to 4 decades before. When he can help, he's saving lives in the local area, relying on his tracking - not his talent for ultraviolence. Don't worry, there is a lot of that, although it takes a while to get there. And then it's ridiculously gory. The action comes as a close second to the incredible character exploration as the most compelling aspect of this. While the pacing is unexpected(I've seen others compared to a 70s revenge flick, an assessment I agree with), it's pretty good, as are the technical aspects.

The traps he sets and how effective they are is awesome to behold, as the trailers promised. Honestly, like a lot of recent ones, they do give away a tad too much. On the other hand the voice-over is amazing. I don't know, start them playing on YouTube then shut your eyes and only listen? That should work. Aforementioned ""adoptive daughter of sorts"" goes to Mexico to ask her father, which one of her old friends just found again, why he left her and her mother. One of the drug cartels wants her as one of their prostitutes, which of course Sly is not going to just accept. So as usual for one of these, he is a champion for a group of people who needs one. It is very satisfying to see him take them on.

I recommend this to those that it will appeal to. 7/10",7.0,23 September 2019

Except for when he would have been awarded the MOH, every official photo in uniform would have the MOH ribbon at the very top as the highest award.

Rambo light.,"Rambo is a rancher out in Arizona who spends his time digging tunnels underneath his property. He lives with some lady and her niece whose mother died of cancer and whose father abandoned them during the most challenging time. The girl gets a tip from a friend living in Mexico about the whereabouts of her dad. Against the advice of Rambo and the grandmother she decides to travel to Mexico to confront her dad without letting anyone know. She meets her friend who looks like she's up to no good. The friend shows her the dad's apartment. The girls confronts him but that it's entire unproductive. He has no remorse and tells her in no uncertain terms to get lost. The girl is devastated. He friend takes her to a club to party, there the girl is taken.

When she doesn't show up, Rambo knows she went to Mexico. He goes after her, finds the friend right away, finds the guy who met her and gets info from him. He walks up to the lair of a pair of brothers who are running a drug and human trafficking/prostitution ring. He gets beat up and they give him their signature scar on his face and leave him on the street. Some lady has been watching all those and decides to take Rambo to her home. She's a reporter whose sister also vanished at the hands of the villains. After Rambo recovers a couple of days later with some info from the reporter decides to and successfully rescues the girl, except that she's in real bad shape from the drugs they've been giving her.

Rambo knows what's next. The villains and their army will go after him. And he prepared his tunnel system with wicked traps for these people. When they arrive Rambo takes them out one by one as expected.

Rambo: Last Blood is a pretty minimalist movie compared to Rambos of the past, which is fine, this time around it's about personal revenge. The story itself also works, except that it focuses too much on Rambo and very little for instance on the villains who come across as rather insignificant instead of malicious and threatening. Another problem is that it's one of those movies that saves the best for the very last, which it really shouldn't have. There was plenty to offer while Rambo was in Mexico but the movie takes care of all that too quickly and without much fanfare. But when things get going they sure get going. Things get very violent and bloody. Another plus is that Yvette Monreal is absolutely adorable. I get the impression that this movie would have worked better with a different director. This is a Rambo movie, you know what to expect, and it delivers, it just takes longer than usual.",7.0,27 October 2019

Not as good as Rambo 4,"Very forgettable movie. Stallone doesn't really seem into the movie, his niece was an idiot and not sympathetic at all and the idiot plot was abused like crazy. Whether it was cartel bosses who spare lives of people who cross them and enslave American girls knowing what sort of trouble that would bring. I would have to imagine a ransom would have been far more lucrative for her return to begin with.

I really liked Rambo 4 and felt like it was a solid ending for the series. There was just no need to continue it. It's almost like you just want to pretend this movie never happened.

The movie is very, VERY light on action, which leads me to conclude that Stallone just wasn't capable of pulling his weight in action scenes. This was already evident in Rambo 4 when the mercs were basically used to carry out most of the grunt work while Stallone ran around in the background.

I'm probably just going to pretend this movie never happened. It's for the best. I know some people are getting political about this movie, but at no point did it ever do that. It felt like a TV movie at times and it's a shame. I feel like there were many scenes cut.

"Good movie, but not a worthy finale for John Rambo...","I've been enjoying Sylvester Stallone movies since I was a kid, and ""Rambo"" has always been one of those special movies that just was an instant liking for me. So naturally, I would get around to watching the 2019 ""Rambo: Last Blood"" as well.

So was this a fitting finale to the saga of Rambo? No, not really. Sure, the movie was good entertainment and a great action movie. However, it just didn't really have that particular element to it that the previous four movies in the franchise had. Perhaps it was because John Rambo was now fighting on home ground (which he also did in the ""First Blood"" movie, but that just had a very different feel to it) or because the entire final showdown scene seemed incredibly rushed and very anti-climatic.

The storyline in the movie wasn't really as captivating as it had been in the previous movies., and yes it was definitely enjoyable and watchable. But there was just some key ingredients missing from the formula to make it truly outstanding. Now, I am not saying that ""Rambo: Last Blood"" is a bad movie, because it isn't.

I must say that it is amazing to see Sylvester Stallone still going at it at his age. But sometimes it is better to just walk away from something and leave its legacy as it had been set up and built.

There is a fair amount of violence in the movie, but nowhere near the mayhem that was seen in the 2008 ""Rambo"" movie, which was just out of this world in terms of pure violent scenes.

As for the final showdown scene, which was definitely set up nicely and had some cool elements to it, the scene just seemed a bit rushed and it seemed way too easy for Rambo to take all of the trafficking cartel out that easily. It was enjoyable to watch, yes, but it was just too predictable.

""Rambo: Last Blood"" scores six out of ten stars from me. It was definitely a good movie with an abundance of action once the movie got into gear. But just a shame that John Rambo didn't exit the stage with a more fitting way to end the franchise.",6.0,24 November 2019

A missed opportunity,"2.5/5 stars

""Rambo: Last Blood"" promised to be the final chapter in the iconic action franchise, bringing closure to the journey of its beloved protagonist, John Rambo. While the film had its moments of intense action and gritty violence, it ultimately fell short of its potential. Despite the high expectations set by the franchise, ""Rambo: Last Blood"" failed to deliver a satisfying conclusion due to several missed opportunities.

One of the major flaws of the film was Rambo's decision to deny Gabriela her right to meet her father. As a war veteran and someone who has experienced the harsh realities of life, Rambo could have displayed a more compassionate side by accompanying Gabriela on her quest, regardless of her father's character. This missed opportunity could have added depth to Rambo's character and provided a chance for him to teach Gabriela valuable life lessons along the way.

Furthermore, when Rambo embarked on his mission to confront the drug cartel, his lack of calculated steps proved to be his downfall. Given his extensive combat experience, it was disappointing to see Rambo rush headlong into the dangerous situation without adequate planning. This lack of foresight resulted in Rambo being wounded and wasting precious time, which ultimately led to the tragic demise of Gabriela. It was a frustrating turn of events that left viewers questioning Rambo's judgment and abilities.

The film's pacing was another aspect that could have been improved. While the fast-paced nature of the movie added an adrenaline rush to the final fight scene, it came at the cost of character development and emotional engagement. The actors' performances were overshadowed by the relentless action, leaving little room for the audience to connect with them on a deeper level. Even the death of Gabriela, a pivotal moment in the story, felt rushed and lacked the emotional impact it deserved.

""Rambo: Last Blood"" had the potential to be a poignant and thrilling conclusion to an iconic franchise. However, the film faltered due to its missed opportunities in character development, Rambo's decision-making, and the lack of emotional depth. While the action sequences were undeniably intense and provided the much-anticipated ""wow"" factor, they couldn't compensate for the film's shortcomings.

In the end, ""Rambo: Last Blood"" leaves fans with a sense of disappointment, as it fails to deliver on the promises of a satisfying conclusion. It serves as a reminder that even legendary franchises can stumble when they neglect crucial storytelling elements.",5.0,3 June 2023

Good. But required more series connections not just weapon references,"Rambo goes on a rescue mission to Mexico to return a kidnapped loved one but a Mexican gang brings the war back to him.

Last Blood is an interesting Rambo instalment, just as you think Adrian Grunberg's well directed outing is going to be a paint by numbers kidnap flick there's a major twist on the Taken-like premise. However, while Sylvester Stallone's and and few other writers flesh out Rambo (reminiscent of First Blood's characterisation) aside from some old photos it lacks some much needed dialogue nods and throwbacks. Col. Troutman doesn't really get a mention, his Vietnamese flame, Co Bao, doesn't get a look in etc. No bandana or hair cut tidbits either. And the theme music is not as punchy as the early outings.

That said, Rambo's father is mentioned, his mental state is explored and his reliance on medication is touched on. The last twenty minutes as the grizzled veteran dusts off his crossbows to take on the sex traffickers are particularly gory and graphic, appeasing Rambo action fans. There's gut-wrenching carnage as he picks off a variety of stereotype cartel. Its as hard hitting as it's predecessor and makes Part II and Rambo III look quite tame in comparison.

Hopefully, Stallone has one more Rambo outing left in him to come full circle, connect the dots with more Vietnam and First Blood, 2, 3 links not just weapon references. We always wanted him home but maybe Rambo is more entertaining back out in a war zone.

Nevertheless, it's great to see Stallone as Rambo back on the big screen. Recommend.",,19 September 2019

Rambo's tunnel can not be penetrated.,"Rambo Last Blood stays true to the series by showing the last heroic appearance by John Rambo while sacrificing a bit of action in favor of more character building.

Last Blood is probably the most 'personal' of all its prequels in terms of story. It has a relatively slow start and may turn you off if you are here purely for gory action scenes. On the other hand, this paced start allows us to see 'John the family man' which we haven't seen before. And this 'seeing new sides of Rambo' doesn't stop there and continues throughout the movie.

As the movie goes on, you will encounter darkness and horror-like scenes which are handled very meticulously. Enough to imply, but not overdo to disgust.

And in the last act, you get all those high-adrenaline action sequences which do get the blood pumping. This will lead the story to Rambo's tunnels which we saw in the trailer and a final showdown.

In summary, Last Blood will not subvert you expectation which in this case is great, and I would even liken it Rambo 2008 except they have factored in Rambo's growth as a human being in the latter.

Personal Verdict: If you are a Rambo fan, definitely watch it. If you aren't, you will probably still enjoy it as a very graphic gory action movie, but you'll have to wait for the movie to get there.",7.0,20 April 2020

"Kinda weakest and smallest in the series, yet no bad flick on its own","Greetings from Lithuania.

I am i a huge Rambo fan. I loved all movies before, because first three were my childhood pictures, and the fourth one was good, but not great - kinda lacked that part that goes between second and third part in any motion picture. And then 10 years later comes ""Rambo: Last Blood"". I was kinda excited for this movie before i saw a trailer, but after seeing 1 min 30 sec trailer i knew exactly what this movie is going to be about.

""Rambo: Last Blood"" is the smallest and the weakest movie in the series - in my opinion.. It kinda felt even not as a Rambo movie. What it lacked even considering that this is a true Rambo sequel - i wanted to know or hear a little bit more about Rambo himself. On the other hand this is a very hard rated R movie - this is not for kinds, and this aspect kinda saved this flick from being not so good.

"Great action, Bad Story & Bad Acting","I love Rambo, but this story was just incredibly lame. Rambo's niece, played by Yvette Monreal, has a friend in Mexico who tracks down her Dad. Yvette goes to Mexico to meet her deadbeat Dad in the worst part of town (is there a good part?). Her Dad is such a lowlife that he tells Yvette to drop dead and go away.

Yvette is very upset that her Dad really does not love her at all. So Yvette's friend Gizelle convinces Yvette to go with her to a dance club. Thanks to her shady friend, Gizelle (Fenessa Pineda), Yvette is set up to be kidnapped into human trafficking/prostitution.

One issue that I had with this movie is that Rambo did not kill off the Dad and Yvette's friend Gizelle, just on general principles. The original Rambo would have gutted Dad and left him hanging from a wall, and Gizelle should have had her head chopped off for sure.

To recover his niece, Rambo decides to just walk up to the Martinez Pimp Gang and ask for his niece Yvette back. Rambo gets beaten up really bad by the Martinez brothers's pimp gang. Why didn't they just kill him?

A journalist saves Rambo from bleeding to death from the beatdown. It looked like a good connection, but all the empathy and compassion are only coming from the journalist, played by Paz Vega. Stallone seems incapable of acting, showing concern, gratitude, compassion, empathy, or anything else. A little gratitude and human feeling would have been nice. First Blood Rambo had that ability to be tough but compassionate.

After Stallone recovers from the slap-down beating he got from the pimps, he just goes over to pick up Yvette by pretending to be a john looking for a prostitute. Why didn't he do that the first time? The sad thing is, the Pimp Gang retaliated against Yvette due to Stallone's first failed attempt, and she dies of a drug overdose.

What was the point of killing her off? Seems pointless to have Stallone recover a dying/dead niece. She was the last of his blood line. I guess the writers thought that they needed some kind of emotional trigger, but the original Rambo would have taken his niece (alive and healthy), and still gone back to wipe out the pimp gang just for what they had already done.

Even worse, the lady who plays the girl's Grandmother is at Stallone's home in Arizona, and there is about ten seconds of grief, and then Stallone just packs up her stuff in a cardboard box and sends her to be with her sister. Really bad miss on showing the grief and love that the Grandmother and Rambo should have shared together. A moment spent together crying would have been nice. Rambo used to be a thoughtful person who was a victim of Post Tramatic Stress Disorder, pain, suffering, and heart-break. Rambo was always a nice guy who was a victim of circumstances.

So a few days later, Stallone goes back to the headquarters of the Martinez brothers, for the third time, and stabs a few guys to death, and kills off one of the brothers, El Flaco. That seemed way too easy, and ridiculous. Three times at the Pimp Gang headquarters? Literally hundreds of armed guards? Rambo just walks in? No problem?

The end is incredibly predictable, but at least it is Rambo action. About fifty people get hacked to bits and shot up. Compared to 2008 Rambo, where he exploded and machine-gunned around 750 people, Last Blood is a sad end to the Rambo series. I really expected him to ride out on a high tide of dead bodies and nuclear-level destruction.",10.0,17 April 2020
Nowhere near as bad as you'd expect,"Last blood was probably the best film in the series since first blood in terms of story .

This one took its time to introduce you to the characters and Stallone's acting was top notch . You really develop a love for the characters and you're sympathies are drawn into the story .

Once we get to Mexico and back to USA the violence comes out and you can see how well this will translate to a shoot em up first person game in the wolfenstein 3D format .

The ingredients were there to make die hard fans and newbies equally happy with a well spent ticket .

This could teach Tarantino how to shoot violence without making it unpalatable to watch

However, where the movie becomes a bit weak is in some of the over superficial dialogue and the speed in which the movie gets to it's climax and then concludes. They should have developed the characters a bit more, improved the depth of the dialogue a bit more, and then maybe stretched the movie out another 20 to 30 minutes with substantive content fit for a Rambo movie.

I didnt get the Rambo feel, it seemed more like Sylvester Stallone playing a guy named John Rambo. Rambo in this one seemed more like a family man compared to the other films where he just kept to himself. He put himself in situations that the real Rambo would not have put himself in and he did not have his iconic scrap of fabric around his forehead.

Not the best Rambo but a good effort,"I never thought I'd be writing a review for a new Rambo movie. I'm guessing I was with everyone else with the thought that Sylvester Stallone had hung this role up for good, he's getting older and this role can be quite demanding. But here we are... the 5th film in the Rambo series, Rambo: Last Blood.

Brutal, absolute brutality. Rambo: Last Blood has it all and then some. I don't class myself as a squeamish person but even I had to look away at some parts. There are bones broken/removed, heads taken off and many limbs flying about. The team did a brilliant job of fully utilizing the adult rating. It fits well with the Rambo character, an unstoppable machine that can kill anyone with a full array of different weapons. The darker side of you will enjoy watching Rambo tear through people, it'll make for great viewing with a few drinks and mates.

Felt the plot was relatively believable. Interesting enough to keep you following throughout, no long snooze off moments anyway. I split the plot to Rambo: Last Blood into two parts. The first part felt like a typical abduction film, think along the lines of Taken. You have a character get taken and then another character goes chasing after them, small scale fights happen but nothing action-packed. The second part, however, felt like a brutal adult version of Home Alone. You've got a number of enemies trying to get into a location to get a character but having difficulties due to various traps that have been planted around the area. It would be interesting to see if they took inspiration from Home Alone in any way. The second part was more enjoyable but the structure of the first part was better.

The ending was good. Everything you would expect from a Rambo film. The downside is, it's super rushed. I honestly believe they had a set runtime of 90 minutes, everything was going well then they looked at the time and went, we have 15 minutes left to end everything. The first part of Rambo: Last Blood was laid out quite nice, no rushed scenes, plenty of build-ups. The last part was enjoyable but was over far too soon. It came across like I was watching the ending on 1.5x speed. Before you can even get a full grip on the situation, the credits are rolling. A contrast to the rest of the film where everything was spaced out well. So yeah, the ending was fun but short.

The last point, I need to mention the acting in Rambo: Last Blood. Sylvester Stallone may not be the greatest actor but he has had some great performances, looking at you Rocky/Creed. He didn't do great in this, damn I don't even think he expressed a single believable emotion throughout. I started grinning at one point because, for 5 minutes, I didn't see anything move on Stallone's face except the top of his lip in a highly emotional scene. The rest of the cast did an average job but there were no standout performances, B-movie jobs at best.

To conclude, a mostly enjoyable Rambo film, brutal as always but suffers from rushed endings and subpar acting. Order a pizza, grab some beers and you'll have a good time.

Tired franchise has run out of ideas,"""Rambo: Last Blood"" (2019 release; 89 min.) is the continuing story of John Rambo. As the movie opens, we watch Rambo on his Arizona ranch. Taking care of Rambo is ol' faithful Maria, who lives there with her granddaughter Gabriela. Gabriela is about to start college, and Rambo is like a father to her. Then one day, Gabriela tells Maria and Rambo that she has located her real dad in Mexico, and she wants to visit him. Gabriela ignores the warning of both Rambo and Maria, and crosses the border into Mexico... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot (such as it is) would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the fifth Rambo movie, 11 years after the previous one. As you may know, the 5th movie was announced a decade ago and has been in development hell for YEARS. Now that the movie is finally here, it is easy to see why this is by far the weakest in the once (and still?) proud Rambo franchise. We don't bother anymore with Rambo being in Thailand or Birma or Vietnam. All we need to do is to have Gabriela cross the border into Mexico, and trouble is sure to stir up. Yep, that's how weak and underdeveloped the script is. This tired franchise has simply run out of ideas, I'm sorry to say. Sylvester Stallone, now a crisp 73 years young, is the only reason why I'm not rating this movie one or two star instead of three stars. ""I know how black one man's heart can be"", warns Rambo when Gabriela wants to see her dad. Does she heed the well-intended warning? Nooooooooooo! And that's how we end up with this film... Please note that the North American cut only runs 89 min (and that includes about 10 min. of closing credits, I'm not kidding). In most international markets, the movie runs 101 min., including a 10 min. opening scene that I guess was deemed too ""difficult"" for the North American market, hence the dumbed-down release for us...

""Rambo: Last Blood"" opened last weekend, and I finally saw it in its second weekend. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati in a large theater was attended dismally (3 people in total). As a fan of the earlier Rambo movies, I cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone, but of course I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",3.0,28 September 2019
I thought this was fab!,It's not going to win any Oscars but I'm terms of entertainment I really enjoyed this!

"Come for the action. Stay for the, well there's really nothing else.","There's not really a whole lot you can say about this movie. It has lots of action and stabbing and shooting and people getting blown up. If you like that then this movie will entertain you. Just don't expect anything else. Stallone looks like an old saddle bag that fell into a hole filled with sweat and steroids but he still delivers despite his millage. The story is straight-forward and a bit juvenile but it works. I heard that people had issues with Mexicans being ""vilified"" in this movie but the last time I checked, sex-trafficking and drug cartels are actual, significant problems but what do I know? Something, something racism. If I were a big Hollywood executive I probably wouldn't have greenlit this film. I am not so this movie exists. If you like Stallone and you still remember what he used to look like then you might enjoy this movie. I was at least entertained. I hope they don't make any more though.",6.0,3 October 2019

Then again if they did that they probably wouldn't have sold as many cinema tickets, nor would they have needed Stallone to be in it.

Rambo 5,"Back again for another John Rambo flick seems like overkill for the franchise but the fourth movie worked so well you can see why they made a fifth.

At a solid hour and a half running time the movie doesn't overstay its welcome. Sleek and to the point, it was an entertaining and tough watch at times and the movie delivers the goods in the last third.

"Good film, wrong name","7/10

This is not a Rambo film. It's more like Taken meets The Collector(2009).

Plot: John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is a war veteran who suffers from PTSD. She has a niece, Gabrielle. One day Gabrielle decides that she wants to see her dad who left her years ago. Uncle John says no because it is dangerous. But she elopes to Mexico to see her father. There she gets abducted by the bad guys. Now John must find and bring Gabrielle home.

Very straight forward film. The film was marketed as an action film. But there is no action till last 15min. But that's okay. Once we make peace with the fact that the producers wanted to use the name of the franchise to bring extra money it turns out to be a decent film.

The actress who played Gabrielle is very pretty, even when she is making questionable decisions she does not come across as annoying so that is a plus.

One of the best thing about this film is that it is not afraid to show some hardcore stuff that usually we don't get to see from Hollywood. Once the niece is abducted I thought they will do a Taken here but I was wrong. And I am delighted. There was interesting subplot going on with the bad guys. One is the brain other is the muscle but it never got explored.

Towards the very end the film changes gear and we see Rambo become The collector and lays trap for the uninvited guests. The action is fast paced, bloody and satisfying.

A decent film with good performance. The short run time is a plus.",7.0,26 November 2019

The Only Things More Gruesome than the Violence Are the Dialogue and Story,"This probably appeals to folks who like snuff flicks and torture porn. The entire script must have been scribbled on a cocktail napkin in the time it took to drink a shot of cheap tequila and a beer. Stallone mumbles through it and spews some truly horrible lines about family and blah, blah, blah. He kills about 100 human beings, although they are all painted as evil Mexicans who all deserve their fate. A rip-off of Taken, which was a godawful film.

Is this really what he wants to do with his career?",1.0,23 November 2019

THE BEST RAMBO FILM. A MASTERPIECE OF VENGEANCE & DESPAIR.,"This new ""Rambo"" is a stark-raw, brutal & relevant Action Thriller, this is the legendary Stallone's greatest movie, the absolute best of his incredible Career in my opinion, here Stallone gives an honest raw & powerhouse performance as the always troubled loner that is ""John Rambo"" we've followed Rambo through the franchise & it feels like it's all been leading up this outstanding explosive final showdown with the scum of the world. Stallone is grizzled & raw like an open wound full of hate & rage at a harsh unforgiving world, IT'S a performances that feels so true & brutally honest it's his best moments as an incredible Actor, an ageing Action hero legend that i grew up watching & loving. The whole theme of sex trafficking is real, the Mexican Cartels are real, the violence is real infact the whole movie is drenched in scarily gritty realism, this is a hard core Thriller with a Vigilante Hero that we can really root for, i wish there was a real John Rambo out there doing this & taking out the evil scum of the world because in real life the scum get away with the sick depraved stuff they do. This film rings so shockingly true to me!!! There's moments of beauty amongst all the harsh brutality, like Rambo riding a horse with the young girl who is like a daughter to him & these small nuggets of Happiness are lovely & Rambo is at peace during this & that's a big thing for such a troubled & complex character, Stallone is great in every scene & brings his level of gritty realism along too. So when the girl is taken by the evil Cartel it feels even more disturbing because she was Rambo's peace, his only beauty in such a dark world.

Now the movie looks spectacular with it's sharp & neon glowing cinematography, it's clear & slick looking but with a gloomy tone to it. The direction is excellent with a fast moving pace of suspense & the Action handled all too real for an aging Action hero in a modern world, everything is spot on & made well as is the very disturbing scenes of the poor imprisoned girls who are forced to inject heroin & are raped by vile sick monsters, like i said this is a harsh world shown here but it's all real too. Mexico is shown as a sinister & extremely dangerous place because it is & this all does happen there Facts!!! The final revenge showdown at Rambo's ranch is outstanding as an explosion of violence erupts accross & under his land & the evil Mexicans deserve the brutal Justice of John Rambo, these monsters we wanna see Die violently!!! All in all i loved the movie & totally think it's Stallone's best film & the best of the Rambo franchise, it's also my personal favourite performance by Stallone. A raw, savage Revenge Thriller & an easy 10/10",7.0,14 January 2020

This is it. Don't get scared now.,"Stallone is back as the titular hero in the fifth and final (or not, depending on box-office success) entry in the long running 'Rambo' series that began with 'First Blood' in 1982. Here, however, the character doesn't really feel like Rambo at all and the same can be said for the film as a whole. It's just a pretty generic 'revenge thriller' that could have easily been an entry in the 'Taken' series, for example. That's not to say it's bad, though; it's just lacking it's own identity, which obviously heavily limits its memorability. Thankfully it's fairly engaging in its first two acts, and actually has a few unexpected and successful beats in the narrative that make it rather interesting. The characters, while basic, are rather well done here, too, and the actors are decent enough to make you care. There's not a lot of action, though; if that's what you're looking for, you're going to be disappointed for a while. Indeed, the majority of the action comes in the final act and that has been largely given away by the marketing. Surprisingly though, as it reaches this final third, it becomes far less interesting because it becomes far more generic. The action is there but it's edited pretty bizarrely, focussing on single blows without any real flow, and it has a weirdly sadistic edge to it which plays into the film's problem of showing revenge as the only way of solving problems. It's rather violent, too, but it seems to be trying its best to simply be 'edgy' rather than make the audience feel any sense of the pain, and it ends on absolutely absurd final kill that kind of breaks its (already heightened) established realism. It doesn't help that all of the 'bad guys' are Mexicans, either, and that the all-American cowboy is the only guy who can take them down. I don't know if this is intentional, but it's certainly giving a political statement that can't really be ignored. Overall, 'Rambo: Last Blood' is too generic for its own good. It's actually fairly entertaining and surprising in its first two acts, but it gets less interesting as it goes along, and ends on a rather flat note. It's a shame, too, as it has a lot going for it and could have done a lot more with the material. As it stands though, it's fine. 5/10",5.0,19 September 2019
"An Underwhelming Coda, 'Last Blood' Doesn't Even Feel Like A 'Rambo' Film","Echoing Unforgiven & Logan in appearance yet no more than a mash-up of Taken & Home Alone under the surface, Rambo: Last Blood is an unnecessary addition to the saga that already came full circle with the previous instalment. Add to that, it is also the first sequel in the series that doesn't feel like a Rambo film.

Co-written by Sylvester Stallone & directed by Adrian Grunberg, the main gripe I have with this latest entry is that it neither adds anything of value to the Rambo lore nor fits in with other sequels to be truly considered as part of the franchise. One can replace Rambo with someone else and it wouldn't make any difference.

Even if one discards the narrative issues, Last Blood doesn't deliver on the action front until the finale, which suffers from haphazard camerawork & poor lighting. The plot is generic, dialogues are terrible, pacing is erratic & the gritty approach adds nothing of significance. Stallone holds his act but it's evident that he is too old & weary for this role.

On an overall scale, Rambo: Last Blood neither has the emotional intensity of First Blood nor the glorious carnage of the last chapter, and is the weakest entry in the series so far. Fans of the franchise won't mind much since it is always on the move, is moderately entertaining & delivers hard R-rated final showdown in the end but it is also an inferior & ill-advised sequel that the saga was better without.",,26 September 2019

He tried to come home. He never arrived. He never came home.,"Several years past the events in Burma, John Rambo lives in Arizona at his deceased father's horse ranch, which he manages with his old friend Maria and her granddaughter, Gabriela. He seems to be settled with his new family. Gabriela tells Rambo that has found her biological father in Mexico. Both Rambo and Maria tell her not to go to Mexico, but Gabriela secretly goes there to ask why her father abandoned her and her mother years ago. Unsurprisingly things don't go well and Rambo must confront his past and unearth his grim and merciless combat skills to obtain revenge in a (seemingly) final mission.

Dark, brutal and extremely graphic, this is a story about revenge, blind vengeance for one too many unwanted grievance. Stallone brings a credible world-weary performance. John Rambo can't rest. He can't retire.

Good execution. Stallone still has it!,"So Story is a bit cliche for sure, but it's ok, because they pull it off at least.

There is the predictable intentional rise in emotions, the motive, there is some decent ""preparation"" montages lol and then the bad guys get their comeuppance!

Don't come here expecting to walk away smarter or wiser, or emotionally augmented in any way, but for what it is, a quick ride to justified anger followed by a gratifying vengeance, it does it remarkably well.

And Stallone is still a fun, sad/angry sob who goes about killing everything in sight with panache. Makes The One Keanu Wick look like the pansy actor backed by overpowering CGI he is hehe

New Rambo: Vengeance in spades!,"I read the reviews prior to watching this film and went in with low expectations. The critics fail again! I found Rambo: Last Blood to be a fresh action packed addition to the Rambo films.

True to form in capturing John Rambo's desire for a peaceful existence while knowing and struggling to live in a world where people do evil things to one another. This film continues to highlight the combat scars he carries and the thin membrane that separates his peace and his ability to wage a one-man war.

The new film skillfully replaces old foes with contemporary threats faced today with drug and human traffickers. Keeping to form, John Rambo is triggered and single-handedly shreds his enemies like a wood chipper -however - with much more brutality than seen in previous films! Tunnels, *BIG* knives, pungie sticks, and his archery skills are on full display in his war against the Mexican cartel!

A film that does not shy away from the classic one man warrior hero who deals vengeance in spades. Rambo: Last Blood boldly avoids attempts to re-mold Rambo's character into something softer and does not disappoint the fan of this genre. Advice: Stay through the credits!",10.0,27 September 2019
"Remarkable, yet could have been more","Rambo(Stallone, adding a new dimension to an already nuanced character) has spent the 11 years since we last saw him, on the family farm that we were shown him arrive at. What we didn't know before this was what he did there: he helped raise a bright and driven young woman, Gabrielle(Monreal, charming when she isn't being frustratingly naive). This helped bring out the humanity that we knew was in him, but had been buried pretty deeply for the 3 to 4 decades before. When he can help, he's saving lives in the local area, relying on his tracking - not his talent for ultraviolence. Don't worry, there is a lot of that, although it takes a while to get there. And then it's ridiculously gory. The action comes as a close second to the incredible character exploration as the most compelling aspect of this. While the pacing is unexpected(I've seen others compared to a 70s revenge flick, an assessment I agree with), it's pretty good, as are the technical aspects.

So. The political aspect. Anyone who says that it's not a problem, I'm not calling you a bad person, I'm just asking you to please, really consider what we progressives are saying on this. And don't insult everyone's intelligence by pretending that this is only something that people on the left are reading into the movie. Regardless of the exact goal of doing so, this film was very carefully crafted to put Donald Trump's infamous claims that Mexicans are nearly all drug dealers and rapists up on the silver screen. At a time when immigrants are put in detention centres, denied soap and toothpaste, with families being separated, the depiction of Latinos in this is ugly and deeply irresponsible. There already is a lot of violence against this powerless group of people in the US, and this might worsen that. The frustrating thing is that this iconic hero doesn't have to represent the worst American right-wing. They could easily have gone in the other direction: have the villains be terrorists, and Sly defending innocent Hispanics against them. After all, the other sequels have had him fighting for those who need a champion.

I recommend this to those that it will appeal to. 7/10",7.0,22 September 2019

Story is very simple and the beginning is a bit of huh and wtf but once the girl moves toward Mexico and things go wrong this movie get's going.

Surprised to see that it is a rather brutal flick just on the edge of gore. The first killing he does, well, thumbs up to the effects.

For me the movie was over before I knew it and nice to see at the end that they made a compilation of the franchise.

If you just want to see a revenge flick this is it, simple story full of action.

"Bloody still Rated - R bad-ass Rambo action packed sequel, for a Stallone / Rambo fan I love it","I went to see this movie last night with my friend with an open mind, open eyes and honestly this movie really surprised me. Rambo: Last Blood is the fifth and perhaps final installment in the John Rambo film saga. I am number 1 Stallone and Rambo fan for life! Rambo movies are my favorite action movies of all time, I have fun watching them. Stallone really surprised me, I wasn't disappointed. Sylvester Stallone is still in his best shape and in this movie he is one man army! That's what I wanted! It is not an war action movie so what? It is bloody, Rated-R, it is gory, adrenalin, rush action movie with action scenes and action stunts are really well done.

John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) for 73 year old man is still a killing machine. Adrian Grunberg directed beautiful this movie sequel I love and Stallone beautiful wrote the script I loved it. I don't understand why this movie get's hate? Why is it accused it is racist? I am so sick to my stomach that morons like haters and movie critics are trashing Rambo III because it is in Afghanistan and Rambo helps Mujahideen and in Rambo: Last Blood: Rambo fights against Mexican cartel and human trafficking. It is different not for everyone and they get crap on it! Why those two movies get crap on it? Rambo III and Rambo: Last Blood? just why they got crap on it? I am sick and tired. David Morrell the autor of First Blood the first Rambo movie is ashamed of this movie. I disagree with Morrell I have enjoy this film every minute.

In the opening scene we have Rambo on a horse rescuing a family but he only saves a teen girl from a storm and the girl's parents dies. Rambo couldn't save them. John Rambo, the former Green Beret now retired and living on his father's ranch. When his niece who is like a daughter to him Gabriela (Yvette Monreal) travels to Mexico to visit her friend Gizelle (Fenessa Pineda) to find out why her father abandoned her and her dying mother. She disappears and she is been sold to human trafficking. When Rambo find's out he travels back to Mexico to find the girl, brutal human trafficking cartel drew First Blood, he will drew their Last Blood.

Rambo: Last Blood is still a bad-ass action film, Rambo is still rescuing people. He's still trying to help people. Rambo still sets booby traps on his ranch and in the tunels. He still uses bow and arrow on bad guys. He uses knives, slash people's heads off, throws knives in people. Stabs people with a tool fork. I wish we would have C4 tip arrows in this movie, but sadly they werent like they were in Rambo: First Blood Part II and Rambo III. This movie isn't like Taken (2008), it has a different twist on it. In Taken Liam Neeson's daughter survives in this movie Rambo's niece dies. Rambo gets angry and he starts a war. Remember in Rambo: First Blood Part II Agent Co Bao (Julia Nickson) gets shot and killed by VC commander Lieutenant Tay (George Cheung) and Rambo gets mad and prepares him self for a war of his life. In this movie he does the same on a more bloody brutal way. He prepers him self against an army of thugs Human Traficking rigs, Sets booby traps and kills every mother***** of them. That's what we got that's what I enjoy this movie so much. The movie perfectly end it, Rambo is still alive, I enjoy Brian Tyler's score he made a score on Rambo (2008) and he made ascore for this movie. I enoy the music tune for Rambo next movie good music score by Brian Tyler.

If I rank Rambo movies they would be: Rambo: First Blood Part II is my number one favorite movie, second rank is Rambo III I have soft spot for my movie, third Rambo (2008), fourth spot is First Blood and Rambo: Last Blood is sadly last fifth film. I enjoy this film more than First Blood but that is just me. It is not better than John Wick Chapter 3 and Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw but it still a fun entertaining bloody Rated-R action packed movie. Rambo still has knives, bow and arrow. Hugo Martinez (Sergio Peris-Mencheta) is still a good villain. I love ene man army movies in action movies. Why Arnold Schwarzenegger can't make action movies nowday like Sly does? This Rambo is still old school action hero like Schwarzenegger was in the 80's Commando. Why Schwarzenegger can't make action movies like is Rambo: Last Blood and John Wick Chapter 3?

Some moron on YouTube said A Good Day to Die Hard is better than this movie? I say hell NO! The fifth Die Hard is garbage!! I hate that film. Sylvester Stallone is awesome and decent in his acting performance. This is my movie, those are my kind of action movies. Steven Seagal made two movies about human trafficking Belly of the Beast (2003) and Out of Reach (2004) I liked that movie I don't care what anyone says. Dolph Lundgren made a movie about human trafficking in Skin Trade (2014) and Liam Neeson made a movie about human trafficking in Taken (2008) they got pass so why not this Rambo sequel? Jean-Claude Van Damme which I also admire and love to death made a movie about human trafficking too 6 Bullets (2012). I am glad that Sly made a movie about human trafficking in Mexico. So what it is not like First Blood, this movie was never suppose to be taken serious.

I will definitely buy this movie on DVD and Blu-ray disc, if it get's in to my store. I collect Rambo movies and I collect Stallone movies. Next week I am planing to pick up Creed II (2018) on 4K Blu-ray disc for the Stallone collection. I hate it that film I rant it in March because Rocky to me was wasted. He did do nothing for me and because he copied Mr. Miyagi from The Karate Kid Part III. But I am going to give Creed II a second chance because I like Dragos and Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago in Creed II was fantastic and still excellent as Ivan Drago. I love all five Rambo movies I am number 1 Stallone / Rambo fan for life.

Rambo: Last Blood is a solid action movie I love to death. It is different from the last four movies but still an action packed Rambo sequel. It was my first Rambo movie I ever saw in the movie teater I have enjoy it last night. The movie is fast paced, goes quickly around. I only wish it would have more action. I recommend it to all action junkies and Rambo fans out there.",9.0,29 October 2019
"When the enemy draws first blood, Rambo: Last Blood gives us a short, but enjoyable run-and-gun movie with an older Stallone","In the past, I've talked about Stallone and his most iconic character, Rocky Balboa. But I haven't had a chance to talk about his second most popular character, John Rambo. To start with, there's a large difference in character. Rocky is an upbeat, optimistic boxer who only wants to help others, even putting them over himself. Rambo is the opposite monster. Rambo is an expert super solider whose trained in gruella warfare and survival. At that cost, his humanity is consistently lingering and has a hard time finding peace. Unlike Rocky who only fights in the boxing ring, Rambo is unafraid to knife anyone in his way or use a machine gun to blow an entire army.

Because of their violent nature, the Rambo series has always been polarizing. I only consider the first one, First Blood, to be a phenomenal story from beginning to end. Rambo: First Blood Part II and beyond have made him in the ""one-man army"" that's often the subject when parodying 1980's action heroes. The other movies are still entertaining if I want my fair share of explosions and even a little history lesson depending on the enemy he's fighting. Rambo is back for another battle in Rambo: Last Blood.

Things have been going well for John Rambo (played by Sylvester Stallone). After finally returning to America in the last movie, he has taken over his late father's horse ranch in Arizona, along with a friend Maria (played by Adriana Barraza) and her granddaughter Gabriela (played by Yvette Monreal). Ever since her mother had died and her father abandoning her, Rambo has stepped into the father role as he's found new purpose in raising her. Though she's about to go to college, she still wonders about her father.

Through a friend, she manages to locate him in a town in Mexico. When she asks to go, Rambo and her grandmother say no as her going by herself would be too dangerous. She still does and does pay her father a visit. Not only is she dismayed to find he still wants nothing to do with her, but when out clubbing with a friend, she is kidnapped and drugged by a Mexican cartel. When Rambo receives word, he immediately drives down to search for her. He discovers through journalist Carman (played by Paz Vega) that the cartel is run by the Martinez brothers. Will Rambo go into solider mode at age seventy-three? You better believe it.

Rambo: Last Blood is the kind of movie I expect to watch in the late summer; a short but entertaining run-and-gun action movie with a star that proves he still packs that punch. It's also the kind of film I'd expect such a character to be in. Is it as good as the older movies? Well... the movie has a lot of opportunities that could be explored with John Rambo but don't. It depends on what kind of movie you'd expect.

To begin with, Stallone may be getting up there in age, but he still has the energy from years before to pull off a lot of action stunts that people in their seventies wished they could do. But the movie does make itself aware he's a different Rambo; a Rambo in which he's settled down for a while and only wants peace. Of course he's still sharpening his knives and digging tunnels, but he now seems like the guy who will only pull the trigger when pushed far enough.

Story wise, Rambo: First Blood is both at an advantage and a disadvantage. I do like seeing Rambo take on a Mexican cartel (any reports of the story being racist or offensive to Mexicans is untrue) and rescuing someone whose become like a daughter. The problem is that a lot that happens in the first hour doesn't feel like a Rambo movie. Much of the dialogue makes him a tad generic and could have been filled in by a random character. It honestly doesn't make him in Rambo until the last twenty minutes, which I won't spoil, but it was a lot of fun. It's also hard to complain as the movie is also the shortest of the Rambo movies (it's only eighty minutes).

I'll give this six Rambo knives out of ten. Though it's not as good as the original, I would rank it higher then Rambo III (which I consider the goofiest). Whether this is for you depends on your opinion of the other Rambo movies. It was a short but enjoyable blast. You just have to wait through a more typical story to get to the good stuff.",6.0,23 September 2019

The Last 10 Minutes are Great,"I am not an expert on the Rambo franchise, but even I know to expect graphic violence, ridiculously masculine and gruff dialogue, and a macho leading man who doesn't know the word defeat. Instead, this movie seemed more like emotional lallygagging and wallowing, and the majority of the film is spent in intense and silted emotional dialogue between Rambo and his niece, or a villain, or the reporter. The dialogue seemed to be lazy and unrealistic, and the characters had no real connection to each other that we could see, beyond that the dialogue 'told' us we should assume. The plot structure was so jarring, given the sudden introduction of extremely violent and unpleasant events after the dragging scenes before. The last battle scene at the very end of the movie did fulfill the expectations of rube-golberg/home alone style bloody antics, but was still not nearly enough to combat the disappointment and boredom from the rest of the film.

Dumbo,"Watching the trailers I suspected Rambo: Last Blood wasn't going to be good; my suspicions were confirmed. Last Blood's off to a slow start; Rambo saving mountaineers from a land slide at night. Then Rambo riding round the ranch on horse back with a Mexican girl he's adopted; bonding with her; keeping 'a lid on it'. This is to show Rambo's a good guy (later Rambo's going to go completely psycho and cross the line into the realm of monstrous so the film has to show him as a good guy in the beginning to try to make us feel sympathy for Rambo). A Mexican girl that Rambo's adopted, ignores sound advice, leaves Rambo ranch and goes to Mexico to find her real father. Things go bad: she's kidnapped into a Mexican brothel/sex trafficking ring run by two brothers; Rambo goes to save the Mexican girl, gets his ass kicked, tries again to save her and succeeds. But she dies in the car on the way back to Rambo ranch. Rambo sets booby traps galore at Rambo ranch, drives to Mexico: while the chief sex trafficker's asleep; Rambo breaks into his house, cuts his head off and drops it out the window of his pick up truck on the way back to Rambo ranch. The other sex trafficking boss's grumpy that his brother's head's been cut off so he gets a band of henchmen together and they drive from Mexico, to Rambo ranch in Arizona; little do they know they're driving into a trap. This is where the shoot 'em up action takes place: at the end. And it's not that good; there's one or two explosions; a few unfortunate henchmen, get set on fire; there's booby traps and some okay gun action. Basically the henchmen conveniently fall into Rambo's traps, and the sex trafficking boss's the last to die: Rambo cuts his heart out after pinning him to the inside of barn doors with his bow and arrow. They had to pump out another Rambo; more thought should've gone into the story. There was speculation the story was going be Rambo fighting an escaped, genetically bred monster in Antarctica. But they needed a symbol of innocence who's killed to justify Rambo unleashing his fury. Why not Rambo fighting ISIS? The Mexico idea's getting too familiar: Sicario (2015), The Counselor (2013)...ring any bells? Last Blood's an excuse for Stallone to go psycho. So was Rambo (2008). But it was better; although flawed, Rambo (2008) was at times genuinely moving. And Rambo (2008) had the occasional slice of exhilarating action. A Good Day to Die Hard aka Die Hard 5 (2013) was the most forgettable Die Hard; same with Last Blood. Rambo: Last Blood (2019): think of Taken (2008); swap Liam Neeson for Stallone, swap Taken's Maggie Grace for a Mexican girl, except the Mexican girl isn't saved at the end; the Mexican girl's rescue comes about 2/3's of the way through. But she dies on way back to Rambo ranch. A 1978 film: I Spit On Your Grave (remade in 2010); cross that with Taken (2008), a dash of Sicario (2015) and the ranch shoot out in the Mark Wahlberg film, Shooter (2007) and you've got Rambo: Last Blood (2019). On a positive note the Mexicans mainly spoke Spanish with subtitled English; the Mexico prostitute/sex trafficking world had an air of authenticity. Technically the film's good (to be expected). Last Blood's soulless; Rambo: First Blood (1982) worked because of it's soulfulness; a psychologically wounded soldier who's pain's exacerbated by an unappreciative world; a misunderstood anti-hero; Stallone pulled that off nicely. But in Last Blood, I didn't sympathize with Rambo. The Mexican girl abducted into the sex trafficking world, didn't move me: the peasant farmers picked on by the Burmese army in Rambo (2008) worked better. In Last Blood, Rambo's a monster. Stallone's got this revenge thing going, evidenced by the remake of Get Carter (2000) where Michael Caine says 'Revenge doesn't work'; Stallone retorts 'sure it does'. Here's what David Morrell (the novelist who created Rambo) said about Last Blood: ""The film is a mess. Embarrassed to have my name associated with it."" Later tweeting ""I hated the film.... Waterworld is a masterpiece compared to this."" ""I felt degraded and dehumanized after I left the theater.... Instead of being soulful, this new movie lacks one. I felt I was less a human being for having seen it, and today that's an unfortunate message. The sets here look cheap. The direction is awkward."" Adding ""From multiple perspectives, this film fails miserably"". Morrell also tweeted that 2008's Rambo was ""better than critics allowed,"" pointing out that although some of the action went on too long, the film understood the titular character. 4/10.",,28 September 2019

RAMBO LAST BLOOD (PLEASE BE THE LAST RAMBO),"What can you honestly say about yet another Rambo movie, that is the question many of us is asking. After watching this movie I give it seven stars, six for action, and one for Stallone, hoping this is his last Rambo Flick!

After killing everyone in Vietnam and Cambodia, guess he figured Mexico deserves a shot at his brand and style of justice.

For me the script is weak, must have been written by a fourth grader mad at his dad, it's predictable, child ask advice, gets advice, ignore advice, gets into deep, deep Poop, if it were me I never would have followed her to Mexico, she would be on her own for thinking she knew more than everyone else. This method of script writing is old and boring, where are the fresh ideas, if anyone know these morons tell them their script writing SUCKS!

For the action in the movie, it's typical Rambo (Stallone) a one man army fighting on his own turf. One man kills every living bad guy in Mexico, so Mexico should be the safest place in the world now that Rambo has wiped everyone out.

On a positive note, there was no sappy love scenes or to much drama, since Rambo is always angry at the world, this was just another at the office for him, if his office is in a war zone, the violence is graphic which makes it a good movie to watch, just watching it, you get rid of your own aggression.

It you like blood and guts, plenty of stuff that blows up, then I recommend this movie, it would have been better with a plausible story-line. Guess next he'll combine the Expendables with his Escape movies and wrap up his career. Good show (sorta) watch it.",7.0,3 December 2019
Good action movie but was expecting more.,"Wow, Rambo! one of the greatest icons of the 80's, possibly right behind Rocky, replayed by the ageless Stallone (73). To me, a disappointing story line, kidnapped girl for trafficking which has been done a dozen times before (""Taken"", ""Trade"") however the performance from Stallone is still good, he is still the dark, slow-talking character we used to love.

The film is a bit gory at times, for no good reason really, but enough to earn it the 'R' rating. It is a fairly straight-forward timeline with nothing surprising or unexpected, it is a shame the director did not build more around the Rambo character and franchise. Go watch it, but please not before you watched Rambo first blood 1, 2 and 3 which are all better than this one. Exact score: 62/100",7.0,2 December 2019

"Unless it's a satire, it's just silly stuff.","""All these years I've kept my secrets, but the time has come to face my past. And if they come looking for me, they will welcome death. I want revenge. I want them to know that death is coming. And there's nothing they can do to stop it."" John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone)

After listening to that trite speech, not much more need to be known that Rambo: Last Blood is formulaic revenge stuff. It even has pretentious language now and then and violence worthy of a Vietnam vet with PTSD, a Green Beret with otherworldly destructive skills.

That Rambo from decades ago is now 74 years old and retired to an Arizona ranch, but not without challenges. His adoptive college-bound niece Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal) takes off for Mexico to find loser dad. Immediately abducted by sex traffickers, she needs a hero uncle to cross the border and good taste to save her.

Not quite his old self, John allows himself to be cornered by too many bad hombres early on, get brutally beaten, and then prepares his compound for the villains to come for him. The booby traps are impressive, including virtuoso bow and arrow strategy, even if the bad boys are clueless about Rambo's potential for mayhem.

Not much makes sense here, except for Stallone's urge to stretch out another franchise but with far less nuance that in Rocky, for instance. It's not that Stallone is too old to leave the ranch; it's just that the screenplay does not allow for subtlety or smarts, even given Stallone's 165 IQ. Perhaps it's a satire? If so, I feel better although it's not obviously humorous.

When dozens of hombres descend on John's ranch, the initial blasts should have warned them that John plays for keeps. No, they are so dumb they follow him into tunnels that beg for rigging. However, they are the rapists and murderers the president identified as Mexican immigrants. Mexicans are all we see of the thugs. Even Liam Neeson's Taken has more diversity and smarter action.

Rambo: Last Blood should be that last of this sub-B thriller franchise, yet the hero's wistful look on his porch as the last shot bodes disappointingly to more mayhem. But not to Oscar.",,1 October 2019
"John Rambo does Liam Neeson in a South of the Border version of ""Taken""","I was fairy excited about a new Rambo movie. The first film was an engrossing story about a drifter veteran who is pushed to his limit. This first film was something of an action film meditation on the plight of Vietnam veterans who fought for our country but who were never welcomed back home and who continued to be treated badly. The second film was a completely different film and is the type of 80s musclebound action flick Stallone became most closely associated with during this period of his career. The third film was the biggest budgeted film of the series, but now has some seriously dubious politics, with Rambo fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Mujahideen (who later became the Taliban and one of the United State's greatest enemies) against Soviet forces. That was supposed to be the end of the franchise, but an elderly Stallone 20-years later delivered a wildly brutal fourth installment which had him fighting in Burma. Seriously, the level of violence in that film topped most horror films! That brings us to ""Rambo: Last Blood"" where the story departs even further from the rest of the series. John Rambo is now on an Arizona ranch helping raise his niece, who becomes the victim of sex traffickers. It's then up to Rambo to rescue her, which he does, and then lures the sex traffickers back to his ranch for one hellacious final bloody battle (though that's after the baddies nearly kill Sly earlier in the film). Like Liam Neeson in ""Taken,"" Rambo has a particular set of skills, which includes boobytraps, knives, bow and arrows, and all sorts of guns. The film's final battle is something to behold for fans of over-the-top action, but the story leading up to it is almost insufferable in how serious it takes itself. If they had been developed right, a revenge story around sex trafficking would work, but in this film it simply serves as grist for Stallone to go all Rambo on the bad guys. It's a completely perfunctory set-up that only serves as an excuse to get to the boobytrap heavy finale, which really is great and reason enough to watch the film, which is why I gave this film 3 out of 5 stars. I think I'd have been just as happy if DEA agents recruited senior citizen Rambo to help them take down a drug cartel instead of this nonsense with his niece. Overall, ""Last Blood"" is the weakest of all the Rambo films and barely seems connected to the rest of the series. My advice is to skip to the last 25 minutes of the film and you'll enjoy it much more.",6.0,16 March 2020

The violence/gore is high in this one and delivers some of the best onscreen kills in cinema history in an action film, totally over the top and anti-Hollywood. Unreal practical effects/stunts in major scenes too.

Rambo: Last Blood(2019),"I'm not the super biggest fan of the Rambo series. First Blood is clearly the best of the bunch and was quality, showing the emotional turmoil of a war veteran. From there the films just got more violent and violent. Last Blood kind of came out of nowhere, and also seemed like it was the last of the bunch. While this being the final installment is still up in the air, I wish it definitely was the end. The film turns the violence up a notch but is extremely ordinary and rather uninspiring.

The film shows an older John Rambo who lives on a farm with his niece. His niece is curious about meeting her estranged birth father so she unwisely decides to travel to Mexico. While there on a night out she finds herself kidnapped by the Mexican cartel with the intention of selling her into the sex trade. When Rambo hears of this he travels to Mexico to save his niece and make life for the gangsters very uncomfortable.

The film plot itself is something too familiar and is like something we've seen too much. You can look at the xenophobic trends of the film and compare it to the current political climate but I think that I don't even need to comment on that to talk about how bad this film is. The plot moves so slowly in the beginning and is just unremarkable. The series quality has gone down and its just memorable now for its gore and violence. I have seen far more violent films in my time but this pleased the blood thirsty audience in the cinema.

While the action is somewhat fun to watch, the film reeks of tiredness and is out of ideas. Sly just looks way older now and I don't want there to be another Rambo. Last Blood would be a poor way to close out the series but still I'd be happy if it ended it. However, I feel like Hollywood will try to churn out another one which will probably be even worse. Unremarkable and totally skippable.

Minimal story and a bit lacklustre,"Watched John Wick 3 last night and was very disappointed - this is marginally better but in short minimal story , lots of action but very dark scenes so you could not see the bad guys getting eviscerated in full effect and it all seemed over far too quickly unlike John Wick 3 which just dragged on and on with implausible and bad fight choreography whereas this had potential squandered.

Bad guys were not bad enough and not enough carnage - where was the rocket launcher and Battery powered machine gun that Arnie withered a forest with in Predator. Did like the Malay gates and kurhkri pits but once again too dark to see much which is a shame - we want mayhem and carnage from Rambo and all we got was crash, bang, wallop and its over.

Cudos to the writers for not giving us the usual damsel is saved in the nick of time and it really should have taken off after he snapped the guys collar bone and dug deep = it had promise but withered on the vine - it was as f they rushed the end of the movie somehow and left me feeling very dissatisfied and if they had just let the rocking char go still at the end with Rambo taking a graceful exit but no we had to have the cliched Pale Rider riding off into the sunset...nah just nah....

The score also had lost its dynamic compared to Rambo 4 which is my favourite along with the original First Blood and should have contributed to the action but sadly it was not up to scratch either.

Sylvester does look a lot better than he did in Escape Plan II and shows there is still life n the old war-dog yet but something has happened to his voice which I am not sure if it was dubbed in parts in the movie either.

It goes without saying that if you are not a fan of Sly Stallone don't go to this movie.

This was revenge style movie with one man against an evil world. Whilst it had an uncomplicated linear narrative there were nods to Taken, Dirty Harry and even a musical fight sequence, (drawn from X-men, Pulp Fiction or John Wick).

After Sly Stallone's brilliant performance in Creed II he does a really solid job here, again you have to like Mr Stallone for doing stuff his way and we don't expect Shakespeare.

I will not give away the plot. But I will say that this film is missing the things that made the previous Rambo flicks so great. Rambo is not in his element here. No military theme. No war in the jungles against military regimes. Rambo doesn't even have his trademark long hair either.

It doesn't start getting interesting until the last half-hour of the film takes place. Then all hell breaks loose and we see the awesome brutality of Rambo's rage. But it's not enough to cover for the lack of action in the first half of the film.

Not long after it looks like they are living a good life, the young girl he has raised as his known has gone missing in Mexico and Rambo must get her back.

The story takes a few unexpected turns and the action is there too. Of course, extreme violence ensues as well.

Lots of bloody fun but ultimately needless.,"This one is an odd one to review, while I had a great time watching this sequel, I can't help but feel that it was an exercise in redundancy.

'Rambo' ended on a note that should have stood forever, it was beautiful and brought John Rambo full circle, back home to a future that was free of war where he could finally leave his bloody past behind him.

So this film feels much like a fifth wheel, it doesn't fit and it comes off feeling very much like a sequel that exists merely because they wanted another sequel, it doesn't feel inspired at all and, yes, because we've seen this material covered in 'Taken' it only adds to the feeling that this film shouldn't of happened.

All that said, it was fun, well made, well acted, has a high degree of quality and you'll enjoy seeing Rambo decimate the scumbags in this film but I came away feeling that this one was disjointed and, overall, a letdown because of what we got in 'Rambo'.",,6 February 2020

So it's part of my instilled memories of great childhood movies so looking at Rambo in today's world is with a very different experience. Any chance to see Stallone on the big screen is a must these days as most of my experience of his films have been home viewing . I must say I didnt get a overiding sense that this was the John Rambo that we all know. I know he's older but I don't think the movie as a whole suited the character. I would have loved to have once again delved back into his past, maybe a someone or some event from his military days pulls him back in. It maybe rehashing the other films but with this character that's where I want to see him. I guess there could have been restrictions with budget and the studios not wanting to put their neck out too far on this type of movie. What I wanted was a studio giving Stallone ¬£100 million and saying make the best John Rambo you can. All that said, it's an old school brutal action movie. Stallone is as good as anybody, probably better in pulling this off. Love watching him, love the ends credits which really have made me want to rewatch the whole series.

This is the fifth installment in the Rambo film series. Having lived a life being treated as an expendable mercenary, John Rambo's story had concluded in the previous film with him returning home once more. But this time the character arc overreaches with a derivative, hyperviolent revenge tale. Many scenes are deadening and repetitive in their barbarity, with no attempt to reflect on the veteran's PTSD. The perfunctory attempt at a plot means the third act plays out with remarkable predictability. That said, there are moments of poignance-a relationship between an affectionate surrogate father and an innocent teenager. Stallone's septuagenarian has a palpable vulnerability, which makes scenes of danger more charged here than in previous films. The production values are high, and the sound design is impressive, but the film feels like an adjunct.",4.0,21 September 2019

It just seems now it is based on shock factor with far fetched blood lust. The movie tried to be a combo between Taken and Equilizer. Unfortunately not up to either of those movies. It is also extremely strange to see him as a Cowboy horse whisperer. Just doesn't fit the Rambo profile at all. The movie moved along to quickly with very little character development.

SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE 10 YEARS AGO,"I can't think of any actor in recent history that has maintained consistent interest in iconic characters than Sylvester Stallone. Both Rocky Balboa and John Rambo are characters that have been around for 43 and 37 years, respectively.

Having said that, here are a few of my nitpicks with 'Rambo: Last Blood': We all know that Sly has undergone appearance-altering surgery, as well as hair implants, which is fine. But his face looks too much like the actor and not the character, if that makes any sense. Surely the make-up department could have done something about his eyebrows and generally given him an 'older' appearance? I know that both Sly and John Rambo are well into their 70's by now, which would make having the same long hairstyle seem out of place. But I still think that he should have grown his hair out a little more, in order to give him the more unkempt look that Rambo has always had.

The plot itself was pretty straight-forward, and quite predictable. It was honestly an amalgamation of too many movies, particularly 'Taken'. As mentioned above, Sly is in his early 70's and despite the cosmetic surgery, his age cannot be dismissed as an important factor. This film should have been made right after 'Rambo', which would have made it a little more credible.",7.0,4 October 2019

Mutilation porn.,"Mutilation porn. That is how critics have derided this installment of Rambo. And they are right.

The first 65 minutes exist to give reason to Rambo to tear apart 100 odd men in 25 minutes. Eyes are gauged. Flesh is scarred. Heads are blown apart.

The story is non existent. The editing is a joke. Stallone 's leathery face barely emotes.

A gore fest so be warned,"I gave Rambo Last Blood 7 stars simply because I found it quite exciting and very watchable. It's questionable whether any taste is involved as it's a real gore fest. I have reservations about the treatment of women in the picture although I thought there were two good performances by Adriana Barazza and Yvette Monreal. It follows a familiar pattern, much like Death Wish, niece of Uncle John Rambo is treated unspeakably so Uncle John wants revenge, which is on a monumental scale. Sylvester Stallone goes from caring uncle to Rambo in the blink of an eye and we all know what that means. His choice of weapons is just about anything he can lay his hands on, fire, explosives, hammers, knives, guns, nails, spears, spikes, bow and arrows, you name it, he's a master of them all. A positive one man army he takes on a cartel of Mexican pimps and drug barons and before long all hell breaks lose. Initially he comes a cropper but that just makes him all the more determined and we see the aged Sly giving the franchise it's one last glorious shot. I'm sad to see it end as it's given me much enjoyment over the years, I particularly like the 2008 fourth pic, Rambo and loved his use of the bow and arrows. All very gory so be warned but it's not much dwelt on, most scenes are so rapid you hardly have time to examine the detail and you're on to the next slaughter. 7 stars but very bad taste.",7.0,19 July 2020

NOTHING IS OVER!",7.0,2 November 2021
A brutal farewell to an iconic character,"""Rambo: Last Blood,"" directed by Adrian Grunberg, marks the final chapter in the saga of John Rambo, the iconic Vietnam War veteran played by Sylvester Stallone. In this installment, Rambo is living a quiet life on his family ranch in Arizona, but his peace is shattered when a personal tragedy pulls him into a violent confrontation with a ruthless cartel.

Stallone brings a raw and emotional performance to his portrayal of Rambo, capturing the character's inner turmoil and relentless determination. The film delves into Rambo's struggle with his past and his quest for justice, offering a deeper, more introspective look at the character.

The action sequences are intense and visceral, featuring the brutal combat and strategic ingenuity that fans have come to expect from the series. The film's climax is particularly gripping, delivering a cathartic and bloody resolution to Rambo's story.

However, ""Rambo: Last Blood"" is not without its flaws. The plot is straightforward and sometimes predictable, and the supporting characters lack depth, serving mainly to advance Rambo's narrative. Despite these shortcomings, the film succeeds in providing a fitting and emotionally charged conclusion to the franchise.

Overall, ""Rambo: Last Blood"" is a solid and satisfying farewell to a beloved action hero.",7.0,18 May 2024

The slow build helps you to empathise with the man Rambo is now and the family dynamic feels natural and not at all forced, like in many modern films. The fact the Rambo is fighting for revenge makes his motivations very different, and this is very clear in the callous way he dispatches all the bad guys. The action in the movies wasn't just for the sake of having an action movie and with every kill you're behind Rambo all the way cheering on the brutal slayings of some truly dispable men.",8.0,30 August 2022

A generic revenge thriller with an unusually grisly edge,"""Rambo: Last Blood"" is basically ""Taken 1"" meets ""Home Alone"" filled with the dumb dialogue. Unfortunately, Rambo becoming more of a caricature with each increasingly silly sequel, deserved to stays retired, for good. ""First Blood"" was such a great film with a simple story of a war veteran that struggled to return to civilization, constantly looking for a place to redeem himself for his actions, while ""Last Blood"" is boring film that is sad conclusion of a franchise. The main problems with movie are numerous, but the root of it all lies with the poorly written script which makes no effort to infuse this story with the same level of depth and social awareness that all previous installments did. One gets the sense that several undeveloped scripts were cut & pasted to create this one - and with the knowledge that ""Homefront"" starring Jason Statham was originally written as Rambo 5 - its clear that there's a patchwork of creative influences at play. Basically, anyone walking into see some Hoo-rah Rambo action might want to adjust their expectations, because it is such a bad/stupid/boring movie that is dismal and pointless endeavor. Only person who will benefit from it is Stallone and his increased bank account. Bravo old man.

Not Bad.,"Last Blood is not very entertaining until it's last half hour. For a while it seems to be trying to mimic the dramatic elements of First Blood, but it doesn't do that so well because the writing isn't very good. And Stallone mumbles so much in this movie that you almost need subtitles to understand what the hell he's saying. There are also characters that seem completely useless and could have easily been written out of the script. Stallone's acting is actually quite good when he's coherent, but everyone else is just bloody awful. His supporting cast is not nearly as good here as it was in the previous four films. It was a slog getting through the first hour of this film. But the last half hour or so is what saves the movie. That's what everybody talks about. It's relentless action that is extraordinarily brutal and creative. And Stallone does it so well even at his age. Since the villains are such irredeemable scumbags, the excessive violence is welcome. This is what the tone of the entire film probably should have been--just Rambo beating the hell out of everybody, like First Blood Part 2 and Rambo 3. But if you're a Stallone fan like I am, you'll enjoy it nonetheless.",6.0,14 December 2019

If you put any star in the main starring role not as Rambo then the film would still have been made.

Yes you could put Liam Neeson, Harrison Ford, Sean Penn, in fact any star to play the man role.

So a good action film but a bad Rambo film.

Before this was made Stallone mentioned that a Rambo film was being considered in which the government make an ultimate soldier who goes off the deep end and they send Rambo after him, now this sounds a lot better.

Third (and most importantly), the majority of the movie's action takes place during the final act, which comes and goes very quickly - the entire movie is less than 90 min.

They Should Have Put Rambo To Rest after Rambo 3,"The first three Rambo films are what defined the Rambo Legend... An unforgettable character tormented by death, bad luck, trauma, the ignorance of others, and the past. The pain of the human condition drew you in.

Rambo (2008) was just 'ok' and did not harm the franchise but it could have ended there.

Rambo: Last Blood feels as though they could have just left the legend alone and never created this one.

I do like the modernization of the new ""enemy"" as the Cartels and the scenes in Mexico had a believable dangerous atmosphere but it could have gone into greater depth. The cartel needed more character development, more back story, and some connection to real life cartels to add to the suspension of disbelief.

And, of course, the actual revenge action sequences seemed too short. We all looked at each other and asked: ""Was that it?""

I believe if the action was taken to the cartel, with Rambo devastating the enemy on their home turf, it would have been more satisfying. You want Rambo to dismantle the system because in all his films - he is dismantling a system. It is the kind closure the audience is hungry for when it comes to Rambo.

"Lame slasher flick. Title should be ""Taken 5. Friday The 13th Jason Unmasked"".","Sylvester Stallone does a good job in some parts. His intensity was good enough in some parts (not epic). However, they could have kept all of the Spangalish, stereotype nonsense that added absolutely nothing to the movie besides a body count. Also, the overly used ""Taken"" plot is tiresome.

The first half of the movie is strait out of ""Taken"". The rest of the movie is just Friday The 13th without the hockey mask. If you enjoy slasher flicks without the need of a brain cell to watch, you will love this film. The carnage was so over the top I just sat like a zombie and watched the film go by with no emotional connection to a single character including Jason Voorhees (unmasked), aka John Rambo. BTW, Rambo would not waste time shooting dead bodies. He was ninja-stealth.

The bed-scene kill and the last kill were so Friday The 13th I just shook my head and looked forward to the credits to signal the end. What a stupid movie. Anyone rating this nonsense as a nine or ten must own stock in the production company.

Rambo goes to Mexico,"Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) has been living on the family ranch in southern Arizona for the last ten years. When his niece (Yvette Monreal) goes missing across the border he has to fight a cartel of thugs to get her back. Paz Vega is on hand as a helpful journalist.

""Rambo: Last Blood"" (2019) is the fifth and probably last of the Rambo franchise since Stallone was 72 during filming. While the plot is simple, with elements bringing to mind ""One-Eyed Jacks"" (1961) and ""Conan the Barbarian"" (1982), the film is a worthy addition to the series, albeit not quite as good as the previous one.

It provides what fans look for in a Rambo flick: A one-man-army situation with a noble cause and plenty of brutal action. While criticized for being ""racist,"" it's no more racist than the other Rambo flicks. ""Last Blood"" never for a second suggests that ALL Mexicans are evil any more than ALL cops, Vietnamese, Afghans and Siamese were evil in the four previous films. Speaking of which, for me, this installment places third after ""First Blood"" (1982) and ""Rambo IV"" (2008).

"Rambo's trajectory seeks to get close to the character's humanity. However, in the end, Stallone's pessimism seems to find its apex while the last drops of blood are spilled","Rambo franchise finally wins a last episode and tries to deliver a tribute but distorts the previous films and delivers a totally irregular and full of problems. Considering that it shouldn't have gone beyond the first film (whoever read the book by which it draws its base knows the reason), the Rambo franchise did a great job of keeping itself not only alive, but relevant. In a world in which Jewels of Infinity and ultra-realistic reinterpretations of classic drawings permeate the preference of moviegoers in 2019, the arrival of the fifth film in the series of the now Vietnamese soldier, now sixty years old, John Rambo brings a very welcome breath to put the viewer's feet on the ground and ignore, at least temporarily, excessively fanciful elements from other films. But make no mistake: like every good film with the trademark of Sylvester Stallone - who signs the script and the plot for this release - Rambo: Until the End (Rambo: Last Blood, in the original in English) is extremely ""liar"" in everyone the aspects. And you will really like the movie for that. That's all.

Rambo: Last Blood is decades after John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) fought against his enemies. Now he has found peace on a ranch on the border between the United States and Mexico. There he helps Maria Beltran (Adriana Barraza) to raise her granddaughter Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal), who treats him with immense affection. Determined to find her father, who abandoned her as a child, she relies on the help of a friend who now lives in Mexico to locate him. Despite the wishes of her grandmother and Rambo, Gabrielle goes into hiding in the neighboring country and, after being released by her own father, ends up being sold to a gang that manages prostitutes. Alerted about what happened, Rambo decides to go to Mexico to save her.

In just over an hour and a half, what follows is a patchwork of obviously segmented facts, all in order to deliver - just like the films that eternalized the franchise in the action films Hall of Fame - a sequence of scenes from culminating in a final confrontation, both simple in proportion and epic in meaning. Rambo is not in some distant country, isolated from the world and wallowed in mud, rain and self-pity, dealing with the post-traumatic stress of the Vietnam War. Here, we see a man who has all the tools to defend his home and family, and has no shame in using them.

What, therefore, distinguishes the feature film from the rest of the franchise is the belief that this work, in the first instance, places on the human connections presented in the plot. The protagonist restored his faith in humanity, seeing, especially in Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal), his niece at heart, an opportunity for the world not to be the misfortune he saw in so many different opportunities in his life. Of course, the scars of war, on the other hand, remain visible. The character, for example, does not reside in the main house of the land, however, in underground tunnels that he has been building for years. The very way, moreover, as Rambo holds a knife and fork on the dinner table, already indicates the presence of anger intrinsic to his existence. However, the dynamics proposed by the first act of the feature are competent enough to contextualize the renewed scenario that the man underwent. The filmmaker Adrian Grunberg, in this case, stages this calmer beginning very well, having dramatic timing and giving space to interactions, important to justify the transformation in Rambo and, thus, enable the dramatic ties that will reverse it, resurrecting its most primitive aspect. The hope rebuilt at the beginning serves, therefore, as the ultimate test for beings to be - or not - capable of resisting violence. For with the discovery that Gabrielle wants to find her father, who abandoned her and now lives in Mexico, Rambo resumes his concerns that this innocence will be lost, compounded when the girl ends up kidnapped by a cartel. From that point on, however, the script by Stallone and Mike Cirulnick, begins to indulge in a kind of Manichaeism that compromises a sincere immersion in the proposed discourse. With the exception of the young Gabrielle, Maria (Adriana Barraza), and a reporter misplaced in the narrative, played by Paz Vega, all the other characters represent evil embodied. In opposition to a well-constructed fatalism, the elements external to Rambo and his family end up being readily diagnosed as impure by the character - in a conversation - and then repeatedly repeated throughout the work. That the drug cartel is malignant, but with the treatment given to other supporting actors, the representation of evil becomes a caricature, and Rambo, who is no good guy, ends up establishing himself as the most holy of characters, which prevents his lack of control to represent the hopelessness that the work invests on humanity. The film, therefore, does not have the maturity necessary to program such a break without infantilizing it.

However, the big problem with this film is, unfortunately, the plot. Not that he is bad, but, particularly, there was a rush to speed up the narrative to reach its great climax, the epic confrontations between hero and antagonists. Of course, no one expects the same narrative weight from Rambo as, say, Wuthering Heights. If you are in the cinema to see John Rambo, then of course you want to see shots, arrows and explosions. Want a practical test? See the trailer embedded in this text: without direct spoilers, you can say that 70% of his scenes correspond to the end of the film. There is so little before that that you can't even build a trailer.

Even so, this rush ends up causing problems: the main antagonists - the brothers Victor and Hugo Martinez (√ìscar Jaenada and Sergio Peris-Mencheta) - even create a narrative derivation among themselves, like brothers in a growing power struggle for the command of the pack, but this is all played to the side with almost no participation from both in the entire film. Even at the end of the day, when Hugo takes his band - with enough military equipment to face a small army - to Arizona and Rambo's farm, everything seems to serve only the purpose of ""giving Rambo people to kill"". There is no involvement, impact or any kind of action that makes them memorable, even for five minutes.

Even a small twist in the second half of the film fails to impress, being positioned in production only as a forgettable cog for Rambo to devise an ""elaborate military plan"" to defend himself against future attackers, just like virtually every film in the series, where the second part of each involved some majoritarian confrontation, a kind of crescendo where history would reach its peak, followed by its resolution. There are loose spots that were abandoned, but they would give a great density to the story if they were used in some way. Given the way the story progresses in Rambo: Until the End, it's pretty obvious that the plot has accelerated too much. Suddenly, an extra 20 or 30 minutes of film would solve that. Although it is one-dimensional, on the one hand, it substantially lessens the impact of the proposed journey - the portrait of Mexico is harmful enough - the violence promised by the name that the work carries are precisely anticipated. In the emergence of the first, more brutal scene, which does not happen immediately on the tape, there is another twist to Rambo's arc, which shatters in complete disappointment. From the quasi-father concerned about his little girl, the character becomes a killing machine that strips off its human traits to take revenge, but not as a means of purification but rather purposely sadistic. John Rambo does not want to purge his internal violence for some reward, however, to share. There is an underlying depression, therefore, that manages to dramatically move even the segments with the worst possible justifications - Gabrielle's interest in seeing her father does not have much support. The feature, then, records intense segments of carnage - which spectators waiting for the gore will celebrate. The supposed closure of Rambo's trajectory, therefore, seeks to get close to the character's humanity, who apparently died in the wars he participated in. However, in the end, Stallone's pessimism seems to find its apex above anything secondary, while the last drops of blood are spilled. Interesting are the flashbacks of the credits recalling scenes from Rambo in all the films of the franchise. Nostalgic and exciting.",6.0,13 September 2020

Does Not Feel Like A Rambo,"It was great to see Balboa Productions at the start. It moves at a very quick pace, but it is almost too quick. We do not have time to get to know and care about Gabrielle/The housekeeper, and to a lesser extent Carmen. We don't have time to get to know and hate the bad guys, they are just one dimensional, cliche bad guys. I prefer it when a movie makes me hate a bad guy!!

For me, it is nothing like Unforgiven, except the narrative similarities, but that is it. It is more a Taken movie than Unforgiven/Logan type. Which may please some people, as I know a lot of people did not care for Logan.

All the acting is decent from all concerned, especially Yvette Monreal, she does a great job, especially in the scene where she is first explaining to Ramho about wanting to go see her father in Mexico. Bulgaria (a location I am never a fan of as a filming location) does a great job of standing in for Mexico. Sly does his best acting (since the first Creed) when he is delivering a monologue at about the hour mark.

There is not much action until the end, I expect there to be a lot of Home Alone comparisons after the final act, which is amazingly brutal. Fans of the violence in the franchise will not be disappointed. Sly didn't seem like Rambo up until this point. He is popping a lot of pills!!

I guess what I dislike the most is that it takes half of the movie's length I could start to see some action; at the beginning, most of it is just feelings and feelings! I watched it during a long flight and I wanted something to entertain me and, overall, this movie was ok, but nothing spectacular; it's just over the top action and a bunch of testosterone.",6.0,29 March 2020

There will be a saviour. It's fantastic and I don't want to analyse it because I might lose some of it's positioning in my brain, as I've only just watched it. What Therapy! Absolutely amazing and the critics who measure it in a literal way according to it's violence, don't get it. I keep my eyes shut during a lot of the violence but I see enough to keep abreast of what's happening (a breast with a beating heart ripped out, ha ha). Just remind yourself that it's actors and not real, then withstanding the most shocking stuff, the story works in an abstract way. It's brought home by violence and that's the point of the violence. It's political, realistic, relevant and such a good story and good art. Sympathetic to all the reasons that somebody as fantastic and truly good hearted as Rambo, would judiciously go and dispatch a whole criminal cartel of sickos - singlehanded. It's a particular recipe that's identifiable in all the plots which includes the fact that he's SAS trained, so expert in weapons and it makes you think about what the difference really is between a maverick going after the revolting non-human types that he does, and a state sanctioned army doing it. When you're free of legal restrictions you do an infinitely better job. What a joke that people compare it to Home Alone although in a vague way the plot is the same - it's more like Doctor Who as there's a supernatural hero wiping out tons of baddies, even a whole race or planet singlehandedly.

The movie gets into the story right away, though I wish they had spent a little time on backstory. Five minutes would have done the trick. If you haven't watched other Rambo movies, you're left wondering-what's wrong with this guy?

If you understand Rambo's past, the tunnel system and his paranoia over his ""niece"" heading to Mexico to find her father make sense. Yes, there are some serious plot holes but this isn't supposed to be an intellectual film...it's Rambo, after all.

A very good attempt !!,"I am a Sly fan. I follow him since I saw his Rocky 1 and i have watched his many movies. And Rambo series was one of my favorite. The first and the second installments were amazing. The third one lacked but the fourth one filled that gap.

But when I heard about Sly doing the 5th installment. I wasn't that excited. Even though I am a Sly fan. I thought Sly has become old now. He won't deliver as compared to his previous ones when he was younger. But I am so so much glad that i have been proved wrong.

Not very movies are there whose installments live up to there previous ones. But this one did. Sly performed well. I was literally reminded of his power packed performance as John Rambo. When he fought in the climax of this movie.

I don't care about critics and you guys shouldn't too, if you really loved to see Sly in action in the past then go and see his movie. This movie is a very good attempt. And i will continue to be a Sly fan. I am proud of you Sly. THE ITALIAN STALLIAN !!",7.0,9 January 2020

One of the grandest finales you will ever see!,"Sly is still fly at 73 years old!

Sure this film had some writing, plot and technical issues, and the constant very evident score was borderline annoying, but the finale is by far one of the best I've ever seen, and made those flaws unmemorable.

Sure, the critics slammed it - too much gore? Clearly they weren't wearing their big boy pants. True Rambo fans will be on the edge of their seats, as I was.

Casting was great and there was decent character development. Directing was good, and the pacing - although a little slow at start, makes up for it in the latter part when all hell breaks loose. The action was outstanding, and SFX amazing. The run-time of 86 min felt too short - I wanted more!

If you want mindless entertainment that is action packed with a decent story-line, then go see this - especially if you've seen even just one Rambo film. With its flaws, this film is at least a 7, but I had to bump it up to a 9/10 for the adrenaline rush I had (and still have) way past the films ending credits.

"Taken, episode 9, with Stallone","As I saw it, I couldn't believe it. Rambo is now an old man, but he somehow has a Mexican girl to take care of. And suddenly damn dirty Mexicans steal her and turn her into a whore. Revenge ensues. One hour and ten minutes for the setup, ten minutes for the mandatory montage, then ten minutes of action that is, to put it mildly, idiotic, and then it ends. There was nothing satisfying about this: not the action, not the acting, not the emotion, not the music, not the (very cheap) effects. It all sucked so hard. You want to make the Rambo Logan film? Look at The Punisher, not Taken. No, let me revise my rating even lower. This was a complete waste of time.

Cold blooded revenge drama,"A nice revenge drama with so much of cold-blooded violent sequences. Although the climax sequence reminded us of some of the older movies, it still worked and seemed to have been the best part of the whole movie as the other parts of the movie were either sentimental or girl abduction with drug abuse and prostitution. Nothing else was especially mentionable. But I kinda liked the way the characters showcased their emotions, not sure why but it was a bit different with slow motion and perfectly timed reactions of characters in their situations and was watchable like unusual.",6.0,9 February 2020

The action is non-existent and literally takes place about the last 20 minutes of the movie. Some of the kills are pretty cool and brutal but that can't save this film. I was hoping to watch something similar to Rambo 4. Oh no, this is more the Mexican version of Taken without the action. Anyone giving this movie above a 3 obviously don't know a bad movie when they see one. I can't believe I almost went to the movies to watch this. I have nothing else to add.",1.0,1 May 2020
Rambo's back for another round of ultra violence!,"An old John Rambo crosses the border into Mexico to save a teenage girl who has been kidnapped by a cartel and turned into a sex slave. In actual fact the movie was shot in Spain and Bulgaria, I would say at least half of the dialogue is in Spanish so if you're not fluent in both English and Spanish, or you don't like reading subtitles then this may not be for you. Basic plot but it delivers an incredible amount of gore and violence, it would shame most horror movies! Very far fetched at times, for example a posse of heavily armed Mexicans easily cross the border into the US, plus of course Rambo is the usual one man army. With the exception of Rambo 3 this is one of the weaker Rambo entries, but if you are a fan of Rambo/Stallone then it's an enjoyable watch, plenty of action and at 89 minutes in length it flies by.

A bloody end,"In 2008, Rambo came out and looked to be a fair but forgettable end to the 80s franchise. Yet, in 2019, with a 73 year old Stalon, here comes Last Blood, theoretically the final film. Actually, it came in and out of the theaters so fast I nearly missed it.

And this film in many ways is a metaphor for the old style action movies, Stalon is an old and serious warrior, going into one last war, just as last Blood is one last old style action film looking for one last appearance in the box office. In the final credits we see shots from previous films - a M60 being totted in one hand, as Rambo takes out scores of Russian helicopters and soldiers. Now an aging dinosaur looking to stay relevant against a Mexican gang. Ohh had that gang crossed the path of Rambo in the 80s, they may have simply been the pre credit bloodbath. Now however Stalon often sits back powerless as the new world passes him by. Arnie, Willis, Stalon, Segal, VanDamme have all gone from icons to irrelevant. No caps, no snappy sarcastic comeback one liners.

As a film, this is darker than it needed to be, Rambo has befriended a family, who runs into trouble with a Mexican gang - really it writes itself, however the cuts to our hero run deep, and there is a genuine sadness we feel for Rambo as the world has passed him by - or almost anyway.

The villains could be better scripted, and don't pop like they could. The end 1/3 plays out a bit too cliche.

Ultimately, this is a satisfying if somewhat gloomy entry into the Rambo series that ages better than the 80s entries.

Underwhelming,"Last Blood exceeds in gore... And that's it. The story was trying to be an emotional trip for John Rambo, but I found myself not really caring about the people we were supposed to care about. Maybe if John Rambo was replaced with someone else for the family it would mean more, but his relationship with his new family felt out of place. It sucks what happens to the family, but since Rambo felt like he was just put in there for the sake of being there rather than going with his isolated preference it really dampened the emotional weight. There was a reporter and a priest (assuming he was a priest) at some point that actually had a better stories going, but there was only a few minutes for the reporter and maybe two at most for the priest. Had the story focused on Rambo being the reluctant hero again and helping those two survive the Cartel the story would have been better. So, very wasted opportunities there. I will admit the last fight between Rambo and the Cartel was awesome, but the set up to it was kind of dumb. The way the property was set up it it gave the impression that Rambo knew he was going to have to use his property to fight bad guys in the near future via Home Alone style. It was cool, but the set up made no sense. There isn't much emotional weight, the gore is upped (including a very disgusting interrogation scene and awesome traps), and the violence is typical of Rambo, so if this really is the last Rambo film then the franchise went out with a whimper instead of a bang.",6.0,6 October 2019
"Good enough, but not too good.","Like most franchises, you don't expect any surprises or much new. When you step through the door of the Golden Arches looking for a hamburger, you know exactly what hamburger you're going to get.

You're not concerned with plot or look for deep character development in a Rambo movie.

What you're chasing a bloodbath...and a bloodbath is what you get. But you have to wait till the movie halfway mark to get it. And when it comes, something's missing.

The bad guys are the best characters. Although we may not call them sympathetic, you weirdly find yourself more sympathetic with their point of view (warning: politically incorrectness ahead) than the female lead's...she deserves what she gets and really ought to have listened to John's council).

There's precious little catharsis or pleasure in Rambo's revenge.

The thrill is gone. True redemption through violence and the wreaking of havoc is not available. John is no longer the heroic protector of the weak, no more the sword of righteousness & vengeance. He's just another prisoner locked in the habit of death and trapped by his sole talent for destruction with no more time left on his side.

The problem here, the disappointment, even for a shameless Rambo fan and rank admirer of mindless action flicks like me, is that you don't feel it... you just catch yourself walking out of the theatre with a little less than you came in with.

Rambo fans should still see this flick, I guess.",6.0,24 September 2019
A film that fails to represent what First Blood even meant.,"Rambo: Last Blood is another bad action film, the cinematography is painfully bad, the story has bad pacing and plot holes, and this film sets up a terrible dynamic with all of its characters. Much of the action is this film is done like a shaky cam film from the 2000s. The story leaves many plot holes of how Rambo finds places or how characters end up where they are. Every scene in this film just happens very quickly and changes tone and place so fast that the cohesion between shots becomes painfully hard to follow. This film's positive point is that the over the top violence proved to be entertainingly silly which leads to this films biggest problem as a final note for this franchise. The original ""First Blood"" is a very non-violent film, many of the characters in the film are hurt but never killed, this shows Rambo as a human in distress and not some killing machine. This film just makes him go around killing everyone even before the last straw is pulled. This films tries to be a fun action flick with a heart like the original film, but comes off as a bad action flick that betrays the original film's ideas.",1.0,21 September 2019

Rambo-A Natural Hero,"Only Sylvester Stallone's brilliance in acting and writing can bring back the true nature of the mastermind of war as perfectly as he can. This movie is a magnificent representation of the true war hero, killing evil and saving/protecting the innocent. In the words of Colenol Trautman, ""It's like sending the pigeons to the cat,"" ""God would have mercy; he won't,"" and ""Rambo was the best."" Let's not forget ""You don't want to deal with the fact you're dealing with an expert!"" And, ""If you send that many people after him you better remember one thing...a good supply of body bags!"" Rambo puts together all of his skills in the last and most significant battle of his life in the name of karmic justice. Fearlessly awaiting his prey, it is both extremely impressive but not surprising at all to see Rambo's abilities in destroying the enemy all come together in one memorizing action packed theatrical scene. Sylvester Stallone is an iconic hero and I love what he did with Last Blood. He's truly the same hero he was in the beginning, fighting for justice and remaining a moral human being while battling PTSD on a daily never-ending basis. Sylvester Stallone shows in Rambo how humanity should be as he fights for the good and destroys the bad. I really can't say enough about the actor and his Rambo movies. I've loved them all since the beginning.",10.0,21 September 2019
"Aggressiveness, for Aggressiveness' Sake","This is a pretty good flick!

Now, let me be clear, I am a long-time fan of the ""man with a unique set of skills, and a mighty will, who comes out of retirement to get a job done and to f'k-sh't-up"" genre. (Can I call that a genre by now? I hope so. C'mon, they should make it a category at the Academy Awards.) But it's an action flick. Don't look for a complex plot. That's not the goal here.

The first Rambo is one of my favorite movies. The sequels, not so much. The actor, Stallone, is mighty. He will be mighty on his goon-dwamed death-bed. The character, Rambo, is a Certified Bad-Ass from the bleedin' days-of-yore. And bad-asses do not fade away, they explode like a six-year-old's C4-birthday cake.

This movie is a good run. It is not John Wick level, though others have tried to make that connection. There is mayhem. There is gratuitous violence and brutality. It's the kind of flick where you watch every move of the bad-guys and think to yourself ""You are SO screwed, you cannot avoid it... I personally think it ramps-up a touch slow. And they clearly worked to give Rambo, a classically disconnected character, a little-bit of humanizing real-world attachments. But just when you think it IS moving too slow, it get's one step darker, and DOES explode like that aforementioned weaponized confection, delivering some top-shelf, hard-core, DIY, Home-Alone-style whoop-ass to wrap things up.

I don't think I'm giving anything away. These things are not spoilers, they are reassurances. You knew what you were getting into with this one. I gave it a 7/10 not because it's bad, but because there is better out there. This one is still good. I liked it.",7.0,29 December 2019

Ok, that's done. On it's own, this is a decent enough film. Girl gets taken, uncle gets revenge. When uncle remembers that he is Rambo, things get nasty. And in this film, gory too! But, the first time uncle goes to Mexico, he apparently doesn't remember that he is Rambo, and he - gasp - gets the tar beaten outta him?!? What the? The second trip, he is Rambo again, and that begs the question, um, what in the world was that first trip about? Why did they do that to this character? No way the 'real' Rambo behaves like that on the first trip. No way.

The end is back to Rambo being Rambo, with lots of booby traps and explosions, and the good ol' knife and bow and arrows! And, like horror movie level, blood and guts! And a stupid speech at the end.

"Not really a ""Rambo"" flick...but kind of is...","The ""final"" installment in the Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo series of films (the 5th!) RAMBO: LAST BLOOD is one of those hybrid type of films that is really two 45-50 minute films put together to give you one 1 hour, 45 minute adventure. These two film-ettes are clear throwbacks to 2 other films.

""Oh...you say...they are paying homage to previous RAMBO films, like the first one FIRST BLOOD and the best one RAMBO..."" and...that would make sense and give a reason for this character to re-emerge, but this is NOT what is happening here.

The first half of this film has been done better as the Liam Neeson film TAKEN while the 2nd half of this film is a clear homage to HOME ALONE - or as I call it BLOODY HOME ALONE. So, instead of the crooks being comically hurt, they are dismembered, disemboweled, be-headed and run through the middle with pointy stuff.

All with lots and lots of blood spurting everywhere.

Inexplicably, Sylvester Stallone agreed to revise his John Rambo personae after 11 years away from it and he is showing every moment of his 73 years of age in this role. To say that Stallone is a little ""long in the tooth"" for this type of action/beat 'em up role would be doing a disservice to the term ""long in the tooth"".

As is fairly typical in these types of films, the plot is fairly straightforward - John Rambo is living a peaceful existence until someone close to him is kidnapped by bad guys south of the border, so Rambo goes in search of her (that's the first half of the film - the TAKEN portion). And...this part of the film is...okay (just...okay). The ""good guys"" around Rambo are nice (enough) and he is joined by a crusading journalist who also has had someone kidnapped so you think he might be joined by a ragtag group of ""frenemies"" to fight a common enemy...but...Rambo goes in ""mano a mano"" (this is a Stallone/Rambo film after all) and this part of the film, ultimately, fails to deliver the goods and falls flat.

Director Adrian Grunberg sets up at the beginning of this movie some interesting side characters (the journalist, the one time bad guy who is now out of the bad guy business and might have a redemption-type arc, the plucky teenager) and some interesting character traits (PTSD, Concussion symptoms) that our hero is suffering from. All of these elements should have/could have been utilized to bring some interesting twists to the action scenes - but they are all quickly...and promptly...dropped to show Stallone being macho and killing bad guys on his way to fulfilling the goal of the first half of the film.

And then comes the 2nd half.

The bad guys come to Rambo's Ranch to exact some revenge (I can see a bobby-trapped Halloween-type walk through haunted house coming to a corn field near you this fall). Any pretense of plot, character development, etc. is gone in a hot minute as this part of the film is all about the bloody Home Alone-type booby-traps at the ranch. Wanna see someone get a pitchfork to the face? Check! Wanna see someone get their arm chopped off with a machete? Check! How about falling through a trap door onto some spikes? You got it! And it just gets bigger, bloodier and more comedicly-""awesome-gruesome"" as we go. If you enjoy this type of thing (and...I gotta admit...I do) then this is pretty entertaining.

Ridiculous? Yes. Is Stallone too old for this type of film? Yes. Over-the-top? Of course. A good film with strong characters? Heck no.

But that's not what we came to see. If you can get through the fairly slow (and poorly written) first half of this film, the 2nd half is bloody good fun.

Only for true gore rambo fans,"Every Rambo movie had some story in t, some purpose and some effect/badass moment - to me for example in first Rambo when John pinned the sherrif with his knife on the tree, second rambo those few seconds after burying Co , thrid rambo was technicaly awesome and fourth Rambo had some political purpose bc that movie is true story sadly. This fifth Rambo has nothing. I was die hard rambo fan but this offers nothing.

I didint want genius movie or bright dialogies. I wanted badass moments, effect by camera angle and hard music theme in some moments. Ending is only gore and i enjoyed it but its nothing new, nothing long time satisfying. Final kill is very short one, no ""deep"" fight, no finale. This movie is so lazy, so boring. Nothing in it. Final 15 minutes saves at least something, but the sad part is, this era of movie potencial offers very good effects, yet rambo 3 and 4 was technicaly the best.

For the love of Rambo,"As a fan of John Rambo, I love everything he does. While the First Blood is the all time favorite in this streak, and the 2nd and 3rd installments were equally good, the final two installments haven't done quite a justice for this legendary series.

This one is not larger than life like the earlier ones. He is not against an army of soldiers, not as a part of a mission for his country and all. Here he is just a mourning father figure going all out for revenge. Even if so much of killings and bloods, you don't feel repulsive just because of Rambo and Sly. Even at the age of 73, there is nobody who can compete with him in such roles. But as a devotee of the character, you might feel he could be much more than just killing a bunch of drug dealers and women exporters.

Even if it is named as Last Blood, I hope it won't be the last outing of one of the greatest action character. The final dialogs of Sly encouraged me too.",7.0,18 December 2019
Rambudubdub Last Blood Bath,"Rambo may have said goodbye to the jungle (Rambo II) and the desert (Rambo III) and the humble life of a swamp boat guide (John Rambo), but the treachery and tragedy of those arenas are not done with him. Even returning to the good ole' US of Aaaaah to live out his retirement in the heartland can't serve as an escape from baddies that underestimate his talents. This new spread of amber whispy wheat is an idyllic picture of serenity. The only disappointing thing about this setting is that you just know Rambo would be able to make a kick-ass treehouse in the Redwoods and that feels like a missed opportunity.

Unfortunately, Farmer Bo's existential haystack is turned topsy turvy when his surrogate daughter is captured and killed by a gang of cartel cockroaches south of the border. The ghastly goons even emerge victorious against Rambo in game 1. Little do they know the game isn't over. NOTHING is over! Hell, this isn't even a best of 4 game series. All they can really take credit for is a lucky round. John R may be knocking on AARP's door, but he's nowhere close to pushing a walker.

From this point on, gore galore is what you have in store as Rambo lures his enemies back to his domain of demolition. You've heard of a house of horrors. Well, behold the compound of carnage, the tunnels of terror, the subterranean maze of submachine guns and Rambooby traps. Mayhem ensues as these bumbling bastards are rendered invalid with every wrong turn. The typical cartel footsoldier would be wise not to fool himself into thinking he could come close to capturing or even wounding baby boomer Rambo. No, if you're a drug dealer's drone, your only concern while you're down in Rambo's dungeon of doom is surviving until the end of that groovy Doors song ...that's assuming that your boss doesn't destroy the speaker in a fit of frustration. This third act action sequence is like a live action adaptation of whack-a-mole, where premature decapitation is something you'd pray for as a less painful demise. You can pretty much hear Shao Khan utter, ""Fatality!"" repeatedly.

If this is indeed the Last Blood, it leaves a lasting impression ...on your rib cage.",7.0,30 June 2022
Super recommended for anyone who is a fan of the character and the franchise itself.,"After the euphoria (I saw the movie in its opening week, but only today I had time to comment), I will make a fair comment in my own way. In 2008 I did not have the opportunity to watch Rambo VI in the movies and although I agree that he had closed the franchise with a golden key, I was one of those who did not find the release of this sequence anything bad, because finally I could see on the big screen of my favorite characters.

If it was with another actor and another time, Rambo Until the End would be just another action movie, but no, there's Master Sly and what may be a farewell to one of the thickest shell characters in cinema. I'm not going to highlight the script here, because I don't really care about that, but it would be unfair not to say that, in fact, Statham's Front Line was the script that would be adapted for Rambo, the one with an adjustment here, another there, changed a few things and got good.

The movie is fast and wastes no time , but it catches some feeling that the Vietnam veteran supplies for the people around him. It was nice to see the tribute to other films in the franchise and the parts where they played glimpses of the original movie soundtracks are chilling. The director was able to deliver both good-looking and good-looking action scenes to old Sly's current physical ability, the harmony was great. The violence came full plate just like in Rambo 4.

Anyway, it was so worth the tribute and the opportunity to see one of my favorite 1980s movie heroes on the scene again. From that pang in my heart just imagining a movie timeline and knowing that this may have been the last, but that's how life goes.

Highly toned down !,"Rambo films were known for the large scale on which the films were made like in the jungles of Vietnam. But this film is made on such a small scale except maybe the climax which I'll mention a little later.

The story is a big dissapointment as it is the same daughter rescue story we have seen a million times . Also the film is barely 1hr 10 mins long so not much is there to appreciate except....

THE CLIMAX! This is the only thing that made me give this 4 star film, a 6 star. Here's where we finally get to see the real Rambo in action (the only part in thr film that has some adrenaline pumping action). It's a treat to watch him laying traps and villians falling for them. And finally we get to see the brutality of Rambo in the final action sequence with the main villian.

Still going strong,"I didn't know what to expect...I mean the last movie closed the strory, and if they left it there, it would have been still a fitting closure to the story of John Rambo. And yet, this new instalment doesn't feel forced, the only thing I missed is a bit more background to the beginning (just a few more minutes, that wouldn't have spoiled the action-value of the overall movie), to show how Rambo has been since we last saw him. We will have bits and pieces, so we can kind-of sort-of put it together, it just felt a bit thin to me. Back to the movie though: effects and scenes were created with great care, and they definitely look the part...the ones looking for strong action and loud bangs, will be served well. However, that is somewhat expected from the title characters (I didn't think we will watch Rambo in his rose garden, at least); the surprise for me was the drama value of the movie. I didn't feel that this strong since First Blood, and there were a few one-liners (well, Rambo wouldn't chuck out a Shakesperean monologue, would he) which haunted me for days. I didn't see THAT coming. Don't get me wrong, there is still plenty of action (and bad guys will be eliminated in spades, oh yes, very much so), for me it is just an unexpected added value.

Disney+ is working on a remake from Home Alone w/ J. Rambo,"Rambo V: Last Blood feels just as tired of a film as it's title character played by Sylvester Stallone looks.

Right at home among the cheap schlock blockbusters that night one really remembers, Rambo V acts as this ""great"" send up to the Rambo franchise, the ending credits being a slideshow of highlights from the films makes this point much more obvious. It doesn't really care about telling some grand narrative about drug lords, being American or any other social theme the plot of ""fighting off Mexican drug lords"" might bring to the table. The film understands what the audience for this kind of film wants and plays to those strengths.

The set up to the plot is forced and becomes threadbare by the third act. Mainly there to facilitate the action, which the film excels in.

The last act is essentially Home Alone Rated R and it's the films only saving grace. Watching Rambo decimate the drug lord goons and eviscerating them all in the process makes it seem like us feel like fans at the sports game watching our hometown hero get a homerun. It's fun, exciting and celebratory with how it's presented.

You know who he is,"Sylvester Stallone's career is a pretty impressive one, although with not much variety of different types of characters but verstatility was never a thing you were looking for when going to the cinema to see another one of Sly's movies. He's an action hero, a legend, a truly great person and a damn good actor. First Blood was and forever will be one of a kind post-war drama you would rarely see from Sly but somehow it was turned into an action flick and with each installment it dropped in quality and after Rambo III we thought it died. But twenty years later we got John Rambo that was well received and wasn't dealing with war instead focusing on cartels and in general all of the bad people out there. Another ten years have passed and we got Last Blood... would it really be the last? I don't know. The movie is uninspiring, low on meaning and overall feels like we have seen it all way too many times (at one point in the movie I even made parallels with Home Alone for god's sake) but Sly is still Sly and you get what you most expect from him - bloodshed and violence with over the top realism. If this is really the last Rambo movie I'm glad he chose this as a close-up for this character because here he reminds us of the reason why we fell in love with John in the first place - that he is a human first, not a killing machine.",6.0,3 December 2019
Final Mission ?,"John Rambo (Stallone) is enjoying a peaceful life on his horse ranch in Arizona with his new family, housekeeper Maria (Adriana Barraza) and her granddaughter Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal) who calls John Rambo ""Uncle John."" Gabrielle says she wants to visit her father in Mexico as she has just learned where he is. She wants to know why he abandoned her and her mother. John tells her not go. She goes and ends up kidnapped and thrust into a sex slave environment. John goes to Mexico to get her back.

All this is leading to a final battle on John's ranch where he sets out booby-trapping the ranch including the tunnels. He knows they know where he lives because they took his driver's license. And quite a battle it is when bad guys Hugo ( Sergio Peris-Mencheta) and Victor (Oscar Jaenada) arrive with their minions to kill John Rambo. Be prepared for a very bloody battle. Some scenes are quite shocking, and yes, I did jump several times. (You do know it's only a movie. right?)

Notables: Paz Vega as Carmen, a reporter who helps rescue John after he receives a very brutal beating and left for dead; Finessa Pineda as Gizellel, Gabrielle's friend who told Gabrielle where her father is; Joaquin Cosio as Manuel, Gabrielle's father.

We see that John Rambo takes pills to keep his PTSD under control. He had told Gabrielle that he hasn't changed (from what he was years ago), and he is just trying to keep a lid on things. But now he discards the pills and wants only one thing: Revenge.

This is Rambo as good as it gets, but I don't think this is the final mission. Let's hope not. This is a very good production. (7/10)

Rambo-ish,"Being a huge Stallone and Rambo fan I was extremely excited for this film, the character of Rambo has always fascinated me due to his struggle to integrate with society and allow his past to be his past, the film starts with John Rambo living on a farm with his only remaining family, things go south which causes John to become involved with some nasty people and ultimately ends in an epic showdown, although this was an excellent action film I never felt the connection to the previous films in the series and felt that this could have easily been a stand alone movie, no flashbacks, no mention of his past, no mention of the previous films, all of which I found very strange as Stallone is an expert at connecting a franchise even in the most subtle ways,Rambo last blood is a brilliant action film, however it didn't feel necessary to the Rambo series.",7.0,26 September 2019

"2nd ""best"" Rambo movie","What's missing here? To be fair I'm more of a Sly fan than a Rambo fan and for me, I've seen the Rambo movies more out of curiosity. I don't think I've truly enjoyed a Rambo movie since First Blood. A portrait of a troubled Vietnam vet suffering from PTSD

The trailer for this movie was at least inspiring. A character driven Rambo western. However, the plot and its antagonists were simplistic. The script operates on the basis that certain men are just bad for no reason and that's just not a very interesting premise, but what that type of gravity does do is provide ammunition for Rambo to pulverize the villains without mercy.. and it's highly satisfying to watch.

At 90 minutes, even as a non action fan, you're going to be entertained, but don't expect to intellectually impressed... that's a trick Stallone only likes to play every once in a blue moon.

To be fair, I would give Rambo 1 an 8, Rambo 2 about 4, Rambo 3 about a 2 and Rambo 4 about a 3. So a six, from me, is pretty good.

But hey, at 73, Stallone can still pull off top billing in a big budget action movie. It may not be art, but it sure is amusingly bloody.",6.0,21 September 2019
Don't push it.,"'Rambo: Last Blood (2019)' is, essentially, every old-man action movie rolled into one. I mean, it's basically just 'Taken (2008)' for a long portion of its run-time. It's simple, revenge-based stuff and it's about as far from 'First Blood (1982)' as... well, just about any of the other 'Rambo' films, I suppose. It tries its hardest to impart some emotion to its otherwise rough-and-tumble ramble. In places, it actually succeeds, genuinely subverting expectation and ticking all the right boxes for audience investment. It's clear that Stallone isn't so ego-obsessed as to never be seen in pain on-screen. The flick never really tugs at the heart, though, and seems more focused on its grisly violence than its interpersonal relationships. Due to a strange pacing, the action-packed finale arrives before you know it. As the trailers have shown, this final third takes a turn for the 'Home Alone (1990)' - although, I feel like it's actually supposed to be homaging the first flick's forest traps. Here, a seemingly endless stream of Mexican baddies (because, yes, the piece plays into the tired and unhelpful stereotype of ""Mexico bad"") funnel into Rambo's tunnels only to be dispatched in as many gruesome ways as director Grunberg can think of. This segment ought to be the most exciting, but it's just rather repetitive. I suppose it's supposed to be cathartic, too, but it just comes across as rather sadistic. Besides, the main villains just aren't compelling enough to be worth the effort, despite being more than despicable enough for the plot's purposes. It's also worth noting that some of the gore is just straight-up silly, which accidentally betrays the otherwise serious tone. Generally, the picture is entertaining enough to never be boring. It's not much more than that, though. It plays into pretty much every old, sometimes even retired, stereotype associated with the genre (see the aforementioned 'Mexico' thing as well as the fact that pretty much all the women are victims, save a baddie and a barely-there grandmother). It's also just really grim, bleakly descending into near nihilism before it ends with a bizarrely upbeat, jingoistic tune. It's not bad, but it's not great. 5/10",5.0,19 September 2019

Novel Blood vs Movie Blood?!,"Hey people of the movie-world,

Nice to write a little review about this movie and the series in overal. In high respect for David Morrel's and Stallone's version and interpretation of John Rambo.

Did you ever wonder why there have been so many Rambo movies while john Rambo originally dies in the classic high rated novel of David Morrell's first blood? Do we ever wonder why movies never live up to the original setting all to much?

Simple fact.....after sales and after stories. If they would have made Rambo die as he originally intends to in the end of First Blood, he would have never been able to become as iconic as we seen him in the films. Ultimately changing John Rambo novel from a war veteran who's pushed over the edge by another war veteran who fought inside the Korean war.

if you could ever compare Rambo with what happened to these war veterans during the Vietnam war, as in aftercare was pretty bad for these veterans, then you should understand why John Rambo totally snaps and takes his anger and rage out on a arrogant sheriff who doesn't show respect nor understanding to WHAT Rambo really is. A Fully fledged Green Barrett Anti personal Killing Machine, as Colonel Trautmann says in the movies.

This is where critics between novel truths and realism based character progression and movie fact are mixed up in most of the critics you will read about.

When you start to see these films and keep comparing them to the novel, then in such case all movies start to gradually make no sense and Rambo's character becomes an invisible bullet sponge who just doesn't seem to die. Totally ridiculous to no end. If you watch Rambo with the intend to see satisfying vengeance and rage kills, then Rambo is totally badass to go with.

First blood and Rambo (IV) and Last Blood follow a certain line in where you can see how the movie tries to get in touch with Rambo's original creation. Which is all about this quote : ""The war inside a Vietnam vet trying to make amends with his past""

Last blood is a crown jewel on the saga, and it does go over the top with style but that is exactly what you should expect. Rambo movies are made to go over the top compared to the novel so keep this in mind and you shall enjoy every bit of last blood!!

Cheers!",7.0,24 September 2019

The brutal ending kinda saved the movie for me,"We all love First Blood. We have to agree it is the only film in the franchise that felt real and will always be the best. Then came Rambo (2008). I am big fan of action movies, when they don't shy away from brutal kills. Needless to say Rambo from 2008 got everything I ever wanted from a Rambo movie, because at this point the franchise was all about action.

When I started watching Rambo: Last Blood I thought to myself ""they can't show anything new, at least let it be more brutal, than the 2008 movie. For the majority of the movie, it was very stupid. The dialog, the screenplay, the acting was HORRIBLE for me. The CGI was one of the worst I have ever seen in a box-office hit movie. The scene with the fire at the end was an abomination. The movie was slow and relied too much on human drama, but not builded in any way like a drama film should be. Although the fate of the girl was unexpetedly dramatic and tragic, I couldn't get sucked in the film's drama. Until the last 20 minutes it was the worst Rambo movie ever.

But the last 20 min were sooo brutal, so original in its brutality and kills. Rambo was not the gunslinging killing machine that he was. He used traps Home Alone style, but R rated version. And although Kevin Mccalister was brutal in its own level, John Rambo absolutely annihilates the whole mexican cartel. From triple head slicing, to blowing up half of a humans body, to impalement on spikes, all the way to pipe through the head, the kills are very original and entertaining.

But all in all, I wouldn't watch it again and it is still the worst Rambo movie, maybe slightly worse than Rambo 3. Only for fans of brutal action and for fans of the franchise.",7.0,6 August 2023

It's an ultra violent by the numbers revenge flick that cheapens Stallone's creation,"The fifth instalment in the Rambo franchise is a complete disappointment and above all totally unnecessary. It's an ultra violent by the numbers revenge flick that cheapens Stallone's creation and makes no attempt to explore the character who, after suffering from PTSD, has been isolating himself on the family ranch for many years to live a more peaceful life.

The film fails to reconnect the audience with the John Rambo character and we don't really care when his niece ignores his advice and predictably runs away to Mexico to find her long lost father only to be kidnapped, drugged and trafficked into prostitution. It's a lazy plot device where he has to once again take the law into his own hands and dish out his version of justice to those who do wrong.

We should be rooting for Rambo to dispense with the bad guys as we did in previous films but being set in a more contemporary setting instead of a war torn jungle it's more akin to a Death Wish movie than a gung-ho action film. All we are left with is a dumbed down version that thinks visceral violence is enough to satisfy an audience and consequently brings the franchise to an all-time low.

Stallone should have gone back to the source material and listened to original author David Morrell who had other ideas for the character but instead ignored his advice, penned his own story and finished up with a weak script, a one note performance and an unfitting finale that just leaves a nasty taste in your mouth.",4.0,13 June 2021

Well done and very brutal fight scenes. The final fight scene is like if the saw films were action movies. Also good emotional scenes and a great performance for Sylvester Stallone.

"Rambo goes ""Death Wish""... or is it ""Home Alone""?","With this latest entry, Stallone has even managed to mess up the only thing anyone could remember about the 2008 Rambo reboot: the violence.

That one was entertaining because of the absurdity of the carnage on screen. It was like the nightmares of an ultra-right-wing ex-green beret. Or the sweet dreams?

Yes, ""Last Blood"" is violent. So how does it mess it up, you ask? For one thing, it takes over half the movie before it even delivers on a little bloodshed. Then it makes you wait another twenty minutes for more underwhelming violence. And then you wait about another twenty minutes, and FINALLY the movie delivers with a violent conclusion in which Rambo has set numerous ridiculous traps around his house for the bad guys to stumble into.

The parts that aren't violent are just so tedious and enervating. Rambo is not a multi-dimensional character. He's a killing machine. Giving him relationships and trying to make us care about him is a waste of time. Trying to make us care about the other characters is also a waste of time.

If you've seen the previous Rambo flick, you might not be surprised that ""Last Blood"" features a scene in which Rambo interrogates a man by ripping his collar bone out. It does seem kind of odd, however, that the movie expects us to believe Rambo is a big softy, who does it all for some random girl... and yet is still capable of that level of ridiculous violence. In one scene, he is seen casually dropping a human head out the window of a moving car, as a serial killer might!

It's not that hard to make a wall-to-wall violent flick about a human killing machine. They did it once before. What were they thinking with all the unnecessary plotting, padding, and idiotic end narration?

Not sure why its called Rambo,"The character portrayed in this film is practically the opposite of the Rambo we loved in 1st blood. The original Rambo was emotionally drained and tried to avoid violence only to be forced back into that world (a la John Wick). This one is just in it for revenge and the movie plays out like any old revenge flick you have ever seen, both mindless and boring. To accommodate the lack of story telling, the plots have become over the top with shock value to keep your attention.

Anyway, if all you want is mindless action minus comedy then this might be ok for you. I personally like funny action flicks like John Wick or the Die Hard series, but this movie takes itself very seriously and I did not enjoy that at all.

The saving grace is it isn't long. The action at the end is fun, although I'm not sure that's what they were going for.

In all honesty, it almost made Tarantino's films look quaint by comparison. The storyline was rushed through.

Needless to say that I don't understand that Stallone even agreed to perform such kind of violence acting. And regarding that acting in itself : it is bad , really bad . No surprise here that it got nominated for worst movie of the year. It is one of the worst Stallone ever did. The character of Gabrielle is probably the only positive in this movie together with some camerawork and photography , the rest is hopeless , even the bad guys are just there to be killed, you don't care because you don't know them.

"A Great Over-the-Top Bloody Action Flick, But it Doesn't Quite Feel Like 'Rambo'!!!","I really enjoyed this 5th installment in the Rambo series, but it just feels quite different, compared to the earlier movies from the 80's. It feels like another Stallone film, but at the last second, they tried hard to make it be a 'Rambo' film, if that makes any sense. It's like they mixed 'Taken' and 'The Last House on the Left' together and turned it into 'Rambo 5' But I loved the final showdown at the farmhouse. It was awesome, bloody, and brutal. Here's where it kinda resembles a Rambo film.

Ten years after the events in Burma, John Rambo is trying to live a peaceful life on his father's ranch. He's still dealing with PTSD, but he has an old friend, Maria Beltran, and her granddaughter, Gabriela to keep him company. Gabriela becomes like a daughter to him. She wants to find her father in Mexico, but Rambo forbids it. Gabriela goes anyway and tracks him down. She soon realizes he wants nothing to do with her. Soon enough, she's taken by the Mexican Cartel and forced to be a prostitute.

When John Rambo tries to get her back, he's beaten to a pulp, so he sets his sights on revenge. They drew 'first blood' so Rambo will draw last. This time, the war is very personal. They say this is the last film, but it was kinda open ended. If you love Rambo and gory action flicks, you'll probably love RAMBO: LAST BLOOD!!!",10.0,24 September 2019
"Lots of blood and gory, yet dull",,5.0,20 September 2019
"Predictable, but not in a good way","Rambo has the same formula, you get him mad, he comes after you. But this had a new twist, he had the bad guys come to him! Unfortunately, that's in the second half and the fun part of the movie. The first half is a slow, drawn out drama that tries to set up the emotional turmoil he will feel later in the movie, but it's just plain corny. Stallone walks and talks like zombie or frankenstein's monster, and so its hard to suspend belief he can take on so many guys. And in reality, you see that he couldn't. It really didn't make any sense why he'd walk in there, mutter a few words, then find himself getting beaten up. I also didn't understand what happened to his niece, why she didn't make it back. Unless it was because she just gave up. Anyway, Stallone delivers some pretty hilariously gory moments in that last act. In many ways, it was serious overkill, and that's why it was unintentionally funny. The movie overall, though, is very serious in tone. And features some really bad camera work, like all of the driving scenes (filmed with obviously green screen), a really bad closeup in profile of Stallone and a lady reporter talking, and a very bad extreme zoom when he pulls his pickup truck over to the side of the road. I can't give this one good marks, because it just didn't feel as satisfying as the last entry from 2008. Wait for this one to stream. Be prepared for a lot of gore.",3.0,28 September 2019

RAMBO LAST BLOOD IS BRUTALLY VOILENT BUT A SIMPLE REVENGE DRAMA..,"RAMBO LAST BLOOD REVIEW :

Rambo is one of Hollywood's Popular franchise as well as Sylvester Stallone's Most Popular series. Sylvester as Rambo was trend setter in 80s and the first 3 films released in the same decade did so well critically and commercially. Now the Fifith film of the franchise ""Rambo Last Blood"" is releasing after 11 years gap since ""Rambo"" (2008). We all miss that Young, dashing and Muscleous Rambo but gotto accept his age and physical changes though. Rambo Last Blood as fifth Film doesn't help anything in the Franchise but just adds another Watchable Action Entertainer.

The film opens with the scene where John Rambo fails to save a few people from a flash flood amid a storm. After the opening scene, 11 years after returning to the United States from Thailand, John Rambo now lives in Bowie, Arizona and works on his long-estranged family's ranch with his niece Gabrielle. Though his life is free from the violence that long defined it, Rambo still suffers from severe post-traumatic stress disorder, which Gabrielle helps him cope with. A nursing student with a promising future, Gabrielle insists on visiting Mexico to visit her estranged father despite Rambo's wishes not, out of knowing Mexico is crime-filled. Deciding to refuse hearing his words, Gabrielle leaves to Mexico. Now what happens to Gabrielle and how Rambo takes Revenge continues the storyline and you have to watch film to find his revenge.

With the runtime of around 88 minutes, Rambo Last Blood is quick ending film but that makes it a limited space action film. Action scenes are Brutally Violent and that's why Enjoyable. Cinematography is decent and so does the Screenplay. Even though there are no Loo breaks, there are no USP factors as well. Sylvester Stallone as Rambo is Good, Yvette Monreal as Gabrielle looks Cute and Beautiful. Sergio Peris shines in Negative role whereas Adriana Brarraza as Maria and Paz Vega as Carmen are fine.

Overall imact of the film doesn't really suit Rambo's Image which we love to see, hence film ends on an Average Note. Being an simple Revenge Drama, Last Blood is surely one time watchable but the standard of Rambo Franchise deserves a bettter film with something really inspiring and recommendable. This one is watchable only and only for Sylvester Stallone's Action Avatar and if you really enjoy watching it then go for it.

"A huge Rambo franchise fan review., Not a action movie like all the other Rambo Movies","A huge Rambo franchise fan review..

I have been a fan of the Rambo franchise since the first film, I owned the toys, comics and annuals etc so I was looking forwards to this movie as I thought Rambo 4 wasn't that bad and 5 would improve on it (I was wrong).

Firstly I dont think this movie could be called an action film which I think all the other Rambo films are. One hour and ten minutes pass before the action starts and the actual action part of the film is under thirty minutes which really disappointed me.

I enjoy all the Rambo films but I really cant see myself re-watching this, it is by far the weakest of all the Rambo movies. Its like teh writters looked for a reason to get people to attack John and took over an hour to set this up where as it could have been as simple as an old enemy from the past wants to see John dead.

Another sequel from that was not needed and seemed forced and doesn't really have anything to do with the previous movies apart from some clips of the old movies in the credits!",3.0,17 January 2020

You don't get the feeling that Rambo and the young girl really bonded over the years. They say the words, but you don't see/feel a bond between them. In fact, Stallone's current version of Rambo does not even act like how you would expect Rambo to be. I felt the same about the last Rambo movie.

I don't think Rambo would have short cut hair. I could even see him growing a beard. I could see him on a ranch, but not with some women cleaning it for him or staying there for any reason. He would end up a loner. A recluse. Single. If he seen someone in trouble, he would help. That is how I see Rambo in his later years. Not what Stallone has him depicted as in this movie.

However, it is also realistic and if one man ever had to take down an army there is no question it would be done just like the way John Rambo did in this movie. The action is very stylish and graphic. There is essentially an epic killing move for each villain which is simply amazing.

Disappointing movie,"I was really excited for Rambo: Last Blood since I enjoyed the Rambo movies including Rambo 3. 11 years has passed since the last movie so Rambo 5 should have a good story. Rambo: Last Blood wasn't terrible but it's disappointing.

Yeah it's similar to Taken but it's not a rip-off since the script was planned for Rambo 4. Mexican cartels are kidnapping young women in real life, it's been happening for over ten years now. Stallone's buddy Dolph Lundgren was inspired to make Skin Trade which came out in 2014 and I seen it on Netflix Canada.

This is the shortest Rambo movie at 89 minutes and you certainly feel it because the story is clunky and rushed. The first act establishes Rambo's relationship with his niece which is nice but it's not enough. Rambo is living a quiet life as a rancher but he still has PTSD which he accepts.

The acting is fine, nearly everyone does their job. Stallone phones in his performance despite doing well in the Creed movies and Rambo 4. I guess his reasoning is the script but he could have done better since he has three daughters.

There's only three action scenes and only the climax is good. People naturally compared this to Home Alone since it's a classic. Yes, it's brutal but over the top which may feel silly to some. I think everyone agrees this movie was overmarketed.

Overall, Rambo: Last Blood was disappointing. It's a generic action movie that easily could of starred Jason Statham or Liam Neeson. It feels like a direct to DVD movie which is appriorate since Millnillieum Films is the studio. If you're a Rambo fan, you'll see this sooner or later and no, I don't want to see another movie. Stallone wants to reboot Cobra and Tango & Cash which I'm fine with, hopefully he won't phone it in.",4.0,20 September 2019
"With all my heart and soul, I wanted to at least like it.","Stallone's Trumpian border wall advert features horses, a lot of tunnels (and, therefore, tunneling, naturally), misogyny, and a final act which reminded me of just how good Home Alone is. The film's saving grace is that it doesn't take itself too seriously, yet that is simply not an excuse for just how badly constructed and incoherently messy Rambo: Last Blood is. All I asked for was a fitting send-off for a character who I have previously enjoyed watching on the big screen. Instead, the message is very clear; Stallone has run out of ideas. I'm not angry, I'm just very, very sad.",2.0,27 September 2019
I don't get the critics!,"Well, it's a violent action flick. When you go to see a Rambo movie, that's kind of what you're expecting. But the critics seem to be expecting a romantic comedy or something of that sort. I don't get that metascore.",9.0,24 September 2019
A poor farewell for a good franchise,"Stallone is a good writer? Yes, of course; he creates Rocky who becomes one of the longer franchises and even expanded to actual times with CREED already in its second installment. Rambo First Blood spanned three follow ups (impressive considering the character dies in the first book). But now for closure cames Rambo V or Last Blood a poorly written and produced movie. I am not that surprised considering the disastrous Dark Phoenix. At least this one is more modest in terms of production.

The typical story of vengeance after kidnaping a daughter (adopted in this case). There are a few incredible violent and gory action scenes; but iwritting t is too simplistic for its own good. Secondary characters are caricatures. Only one interesting bad guy; the always reliable Oscar Jaenada that creates the most hideous and scaring villain I saw in a long time. He is incredible realistic; a real bad person; but his dead; the most expected of the movie happens out of camera. It is the only one; the others are quite detailed and bloody.

It is surprising that the characters are Mexicah; but actors are mostly from Spain. Aside from Jaenada, there is Paz Vega (doing nothing really) and Sergio Peris-Mencheta (the second bad guy very poorly written).

In brief; if you want a few very violent and gory scenes but lots of dead time in between; perhaps it is your movie. Otherwise check the previous chapters that are far better.",4.0,23 September 2019

Not worth to watch,"I am a lifelong fan of the franchise. After seeing the 'woke' reviews I wanted to watch the movie even more. Rambo 4 was a great and fun watch so my expectations were sky high. Stallone is a capable man who knows his strengths and flaws, we saw that in Rambo 4 but as well in the Creed series. The director also made some very decent action movies who knew exactly what they were. Everything was set up for Rambo to go out with a bang.

Unfortunately this was not the case. This movie is a train wreck and the worst I've seen in a long long time. I want to start with the biggest problem, but there are just to many. I'll just write what comes in mind. The movie does not know what it is, so it never finds a good pace or development. It contains several styles that don't mesh. The introduction takes way, way to long, some events make no scene, the dialogues are stupid, the action is underwhelming, the ending is has no satisfaction, there is no big fight scene or machine gun action that's worth a movie ticket, ... There are some grains of potential in the movie (the gore, the location of the final act, the opponents) but they lead to nowhere, but many characters, scenes and dialogues lead to nowhere. I truly felt sad after watching this movie. Avoid at all costs.

Legends Never Die....,"It sure seemed like the end of Rambo 4 meant that he was finally going home and in a way ""walking off into the sunset"", well leave it to Stallone to revisit the character *one* more time. Last Blood in many ways feels like a fitting end to the series. It's extremely violent, Stallone is once again difficult to understand, and it contains as many cheesy one liners as it does moments to cheer for because of some elaborately gruesome kill Rambo makes on a henchman. It's like this film wants to be both Logan and Taken at the same time, while throwing in some over the top Expendables like action. It's nothing short of absurd.

A great movie and a great ending to the Rambo series...,"The so called critics that label this movie as a ""Trumpian fantasy"" really have something to learn. They need to learn that there is evil in the world and sex trafficking is really happening. Not only in Mexico, but in other parts of the world as well. These so called critics say this movie is a fantasy, but do they have the statistics of how many poor girls and women have been force into the sex trafficking business? I guess to them it's not happening, especially in Mexico. What a joke. If you are one of the so called critics you are a critic for a reason - REVIEW THE MOVIE for the MOVIE not your Truth or political beliefs! I actually read the critics reviews for the last year and then have read the audience reviews and I have to say, I agree MUCH more with the audience who is really reviewing the movie without some kind of agenda in mind - at least most of the audience does.

Anyhow, the movie starts a little slow, but builds up very nicely and talk about a great ending. If you thought Rambo was brutal in his previous movies you are in for a treat! I love how he lures these sex traffickers back to his farm, just great. I understand that Rambo is fictional character, but these movies have dealt with real issues that have happened or are happening in the world.

I would highly recommend this movie, if you are a fan of the series. I like 1, 2 4 and 5 - 3 not so much. Stay for the credits as it is a great montage of all the previous Movies. This is up there with John Wick 3 as the best of the year.

An Honest Review,"So I'm going ahead and giving this 10 out of 10 stars, not because I think it deserves it, but because there is a 1 star review entitled ""White Supremacy is Cancer"" and that seems to be the concept of a LOT of negative reviews.

However, I have actually seen it and I can 100% guarantee that it has NOTHING to do with the content of those reviews. None of that is mentioned or implied.

HOWEVER, there are negative reviews that ultimately say that this is NOT a Rambo film... and that is fair. If you compare it to Rambo First Blood Part II, III, and Rambo the 1 star reviews make sense. It is not at all like 2-4... so if you are expecting a Rambo like the sequels you're probably not going to like it... but you are probably not going to like it for entirely fair reasons.

I won't fault you for that negative review.

It's a lot more like the first film. More like Rambo First Blood... only instead of the military it's a drug cartel and instead of chasing Rambo he's... kind of... chasing them.... kind of... for revenge.

Like all the other Rambo movies, it's formulaic. Once more we start off with Rambo trying to get out of the business, and this time he has gotten out and been adopted as an ""Uncle"" by a Latino family.

And to follow the formula, like in the Godfather, he gets pulled back in. This time the daughter of said Latino family leaves to track down her family, goes to cartel occupied Mexico, and gets promptly kidnapped, sending Rambo on a blood crazed path to get her back and deliver vengeance on the cartels.

Unlike the sequels, however, it's a little more of a slow burner. It takes a little more time to set up the characters, it takes a little more time to set up the plot and the relationships, and (shockingly given that in most of the Rambo films the enemy is almost faceless he's so under-developed) it actually takes a little time to set up the heavy as well.

And in the end there is a lot of killing, a lot of elderly action, and ultimately a lot of fun... but what there is not a lot of is political messaging... because, at it's heart, it's just another action movie.

Which leads me to the third type of negative review... the reviews critical of it being an action movie... those I don't understand... It's a Rambo movie, you know exactly what it is... and action movie... so what kind of film did they think they were going to see?",10.0,26 September 2019
Where's the story??,"I whole heartedly liked this movie. My only beef with it is I feel it didn't provide any back story with the woman and girl he was living with. I know the girl called him Uncle John, but who was he to her?? How did they come to know each other. I assumed she was his brothers daughter and her deceased mother was the brothers wife, but further into the story you find out she's not related to him at all. So again who are they to each other. I think this movie should've started shortly after the last one ended. It needed more back story",5.0,19 April 2020
Self-parody,"First Blood was a decent film that I enjoy. I have seen all of the other Rambo films, and this one is the most cartoonishly gratuitous one of them all, completely creating a parody of Rambo. Ironically, this seems to be the exact thing that the film is trying to avoid because of the serious tone, particularly the closing credit sequence that desperately wants to convince viewers that this movie possesses a measure of class, and a point. This film possesses neither. And the action falls flat. The final sequence was a boring paint-by-numbers approach to an action set-piece.",2.0,5 April 2020
The very best.,"The best film I have ever seen; alongside Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. The script is incredible; who would think of a cut back to the housekeeper at home, then praying, in the middle of such drama. And the script is real.. Sly Stallone is unbelievable: should be up for Best Actor. I would say Best Picture Oscar as well.. He shows intensity and intelligence; supreme skill and great great acting judgement.. The film doesn't pull punches, but none of it is gratuitous. Only 1hr 20: lean and mean... I have to go and see it again, it is so so good..

I love you Sly but .....,"Sylvester Stallone was a hero for me growing up so it pains me to write a negative review because I'm always rooting for him to do well.

Out of principle and loyalty, I'm not going to say anymore than that except to say that the 4 marks are solely out of love and loyalty for his work over the years.

I will try to watch it again at some point in the hope that I can find more marks from somewhere because, I repeat, I love Sylvester Stallone like he's family.

Some of the fight scenes were very highly speed ramped that looked awful, not stylish at all and looked like they were trying to hide something.

Home Alone: Down Mexico Way,"This was a decent B action movie, but it had nothing to do with Rambo.

The subtitles didn't work on the blu-ray I watched, which made viewing this movie a bit difficult in two ways. First of all I suspect that Stallone has suffered a stroke, because he's slurring more than ever. Even when he's speaking what I assume is English, it's at times almost impossible to hear what he says. Secondly, a third or so of the dialogue is in Spanish, a language I don't speak. But it's amazing how much Mexican slang one has picked up from watching Blood In Blood Out probably more than a dozen times. And in all fairness, what the bad guys are saying is most likely of little importance. Since all the Mexicans are acting like they're in a telenovela, you don't have to be a genius to figure out what's happening on screen.

The last 10-15 minutes of the movie is the reason you're watching the movie.

I don't know whether to blame the director, cinematographer or the editor, but the geography in the fight scenes is, shall we say, muddled.

Somewhat disappointing final chapter,"I just want to say that I think this film is better than Rambo 4, which was really just a mindless slaughter with some poor attempts at drama and character development. This time around Sly kinda made us care, but again it is the violence it is all about.

What I find strange is that this is not a classic Rambo movie. To sum it up, you could say it is a mix of 'Taken' and 'Home Alone'. There is no war, no army to confront. Instead he confronts a Mexican gang that's into sex slavery and human trafficking. You can tell that Stallone can't wait to get to the violence, and that is where he feels comfortable as a director and actor. I really wonder what compels him to make movies. What disappointed me the most is that I still don't know. His message is that life is struggle and pain and loss, and one has to keep going and keep hitting back, always getting back on his feet. It is more or less the same message as the Rocky movies. But apart from that, Stallone never seemed interested to deliver on the drama. At the end of the day, action is what he really loves, and this film would have benefited from a stronger story and better drama. There is no real sense of closure, and it came across as Stallone indulging his desire to make violent movies. After all these years, that is all he is about. And that speaks more than any idea he has presented us with in his movies. Not a good way to end the series. The final chapter should have tried to match and maybe somewhat mimic the first Rambo movie in terms of emotion and investment in the characters. Instead we got to see first and foremost lots of violence from a man who clearly doesn't feel the need to do much more than that. I am disappointed in Sly more than the movie itself. It's otherwise a decent movie. Nothing more, nothing less.",5.0,15 December 2023

Different but not out of character for Rambo,"This installment has a different tone from other Rambo movies. It is not set in a far away Asian country, nor does Stallone's character sport a bandana and a huge gun. This is more like a western, where ' Uncle John' manages a ranch and lives with his niece. When his niece decides to search for her lost father in Mexico and does not return, that is when the story begins. The trailer captures the tone of the movie well and wisely does not reveal much. The first half of the movie seems to drag a bit, and only serves to provide a reason for Rambo to go on rampage. It tries to establish Rambo as still suffering from PTSD and his efforts to be able to save people. To cope, he digs tunnels, and volunteers in rescue work. Despite the runtime, the effort to display Rambo's frailty and humanity fails, and when the action starts, we see Rambo as the one-man army we have known him to be. The actions are great, and literally explosive. There is a lot of blood and gore, yet we understand why Rambo resorts to such such brutal retaliation. In other words, the action does not disappoint at all. Some may comment the movie's villains being Mexicans near the border, but plotwise, where can you find bad guys who are as deadly as any of Rambo's previous enemies. Also Rambo cannot just invade Mexico to rid the country of cartels. However, I am in no position to argue for the director's decision. What I can say is as an action movie, it delivers with tonnes of explosion, and rage-fuelled gore. Yet though I enjoyed it, I still believe that this movie could have been much more epic if they handled Rambo's character better. If they succeeded at highlighting how Rambo struggles with PTSD, and has insecurities about not being able to save people, the climax (great as it is) would be extremely fulfilling. Thus, this conclusion to the franchise serves as a slightly louder than average bang. ... But wait for the post-credit montage. It is worth the watch.",8.0,25 September 2019

As a Rambo fan, I found this film worth the price of admission. I saw it in 4DX and the effects made the action scenes a lot more enjoyable. Sylvester Stallone just proved that action heroes can't be stopped by their age as it's just a number.

Story-wise, it might not be the best in the series as it has a plot at times similar to Taken and other action movies about kidnapping: a plot that has been told over and over since years. Nevertheless, the film's execution is excellent and that matters more than the freshness of the plot. Plus, the film made me want more when it ended. At that point, I was like what? Is that all? I didn't want it to end. It was that good.

Sylvestor Stallone has carried the whole film on his shoulders. Action sequences are as expected, mind-blowing! I was surprised to see minimal censoring here in India. Even John Wick Chapter 3 was less gory than this film but got censored while this film kept the gory action intact. That's impressive. It was so well done that I found myself cheering for Rambo throughout.

This film is definitely worth watching as it's exactly what fans would want it to be. I booked my tickets without caring for the negative reviews and wasn't disappointed at all. Just make sure you have seen the previous Rambo movies so as to feel the emotional weight the character has had since the first film came out.",10.0,28 September 2019
Rambo: Last Blood,"When a friend's granddaughter staying with Rambo goes to Mexico to see her long lost father, she's gets into serious trouble with various nasty cartel types. The inevitably leads to Rambo taking the villains to task in extremely violent ways.

I guess there is juvenile fun to be had in watching Stallone evicerate dozens of Mexican bad guys. However, his character has continued to be rather a bore and the plot and script are highly derivative and overall very lame. It's all very much like watching Home Alone, in that you come to see the violent climax where the bad guys get it in increasingly over the top ways - the preamble is neither here or there. The good news is that this does genuinely seem to be the last one - we shall see.

Was there a script?,"This movie is ruff (there's no dog in this nor is it about a dog so idk why I spelled it like this). There are parts when it enters into hilariously bad territories. There's a moment when the lead girl Gabriela goes to talk to her father that is seriously hysterical. Her father is playing it so completely over the top maniacal and the dialogue is horribly on the nose. It made me laugh harder then I've laughed in most comedies. Everything about this is terrible. It looks like visual slop for one. Most of the movie is disgustingly color graded. It somehow looks under saturated and overly colorful at points. Most of the film is bathed in this puke color yellow. Not one person cared about how this was presented. There's horrible looking green screen (almost always when characters are driving), anytime a scene takes place in a dark environment the grain pops WAY up, and its constantly cutting to a new bizarre angle every five seconds. It's literally visual vomit. The crown jewel of this movie's awfulness is the script though. The story actually makes no sense. The whole thing is set off by a character making a decision that has no motivation behind it at all. Then when Rambo goes to save her, she somehow dies on the drive home. So even though this character, who was the reason this story was set off in the first place, is now dead, Rambo prepares booby traps at his house so that he can bait the villains into coming to his house? Why was the script written like this? Instead of having this R rated Home Alone conclusion, why not have the whole story be about him trying to save this girl? We could see him learning guard patterns, building up his arsenal, and then finally executing his plan. But no, instead he runs in with a hammer, kills some dudes, and leaves with the girl with little no hiccups. Only for the girl to die so that he can have motivation to then bait the mafia into coming across the border to get him. What on earth?? Continuing with the script issues, every line of dialogue is so painfully on the nose. People are constantly saying either exactly what's happening or explaining exactly what they are doing. Some of it, again, is so terrible it borders on being comparable to the The Room. I've never seen another Rambo movie so maybe I'm just missing something but there's also a lack of motivation for the characters. Why does Gabriela want to find her dad so bad? I don't know. What reason would she have to go to Mexico, unaccompanied to find a father everyone around her hates? The only reasonable answer is because a story had to happen. If you were to tell me this movie was made by putting Rambo into the same computer algorithm that made Taken 2 or 3, with a side of generic soft reboot I'd believe you. Everything about it is that bad or bland. The music sounds royalty free, the acting isn't the best, characters pop in and out when it's convenient, and the story is so boring/predictable it becomes numbing. Not one person seemed to care in the slightest on this. Theres even a moment when Rambo pulls his truck over on the right side of the road. Then, in the next cut, the truck is inexplicably being pulled over across the road to the left side. Wat. The only redeeming qualites is the actual character of Rambo. Stallone has never been a great actor but this character is sort of compelling. He's kind of psychotic. Digging pointless tunnels for no reason, having crazy flashbacks, ripping peoples bones out of their bodies, and downing cocktails of drugs. I like how tortured he is. Other then that, the only other thing that nears positive is the violence. Which can get quite gruesome at points. The home alone ending especially gets pretty graphic. The practical stuff looks good for the most part but any visual effects are absolutely dreadful. Overall, it's just the worst. If you were to pull out the character of Rambo and throw in Liam Neeson, this would actually just be another Taken movie with home alone traps near the end.",2.0,5 May 2020

This Rambo is below mark !,"Now Rambo is looking older and tired. Why is he doing Rambo again and again? In this movie the story is usual we seen in many past movies. Rambo fights with kidnapper's gang to save his daughter. Nothing new. There are two parts one is kidnapping of daughter of Rambo and second is revenge from Rambo. My objection is that the first part sequences are in realistic way but on other hand revenge drama is totally looks dramatically and illogical even we feel that all are arranged intentionally. It was not necessary for kidnappers' gang to go after Rambo's home. And Rambo could save his daughter with using his mind & power in his first attempt whereas he is captured by goons easily. This makes movie loose its importance and effect otherwise it would be a great revenge drama. You can feel this while watching this movie. So it is not much recommended. If you are fan of Sylvester Stallone then go otherwise avoid it. Climax is also not effective, it seems very average and like made end in a hurry.",4.0,3 December 2019

""Rambo"" was a product of 1980s action movies with part III being the best of its kind and as such should have never been considered to be re-opened.

"Rambo: Last Blood, a worthy sequel and ending","This is Sylvester Stallone at his finest, playing his iconic role John Rambo for what is probably the last tim and it's a great ending to a fantastic franchise of movies. He portrays Rambo, a Vietnam veteran that is suffering from PTSD better than ever almost and I really liked his acting in this movie, there is something unique and it's possibly his love for the character and role that he have formed into a baby of his own.

I really enjoyed it, story wise and action wise. It's a fast paced movie but the story building in the first half is just amazing, creating this world that we're thrown into and the actors all did amazing work. The R-Rating is well used as the profanity feel natural and not forced and where the rating stands out is the violence. It's more violent and brutal than the predecessor and the other movies but it's there for a reason. Critics disliked the huge amount but they are wrong, it's well placed and a reason behind all the graphic violence, there were three or four scenes that was a bit overkill. The action was great, giving us a fresh experience with amazing action sequences and a throwback to First Blood's trap scenes which I personally loved then and now. The movie doesn't feel boring or bad, instead it's fast paced with well written drama and spectacular action sequences.",9.0,29 September 2019

Stallone will always be second best to Arnold,"And this movie just proves it Make no mistake about it, this movie is just a money grab for Stallone. The plot holes are endless,the acting is horrible(Even by stallone standard) The story line is simply dumb ,and has been done too death before,way better,with cheaper actors.

Rambo has suddenly gotten a step family of sorts, from where you are never told.(that would require decent writing) Most of the movie is dialogue meaningless talk.

When it comes to the action parts, you get a lot of blood an gore, but Rambo has to be the worst green beret in history. He waste ammo on enemies that would've been dead few sec later, or is all ready dead.It seem to be done simply for the gore effect,nothing more

Taken meets ultra violent Home Alone,"And that's the whole movie. An hour of a boring Taken rip off and then 30 minutes of Home Alone with deadly weapons and gruesome deaths. The last 20 minutes (the super violent part) gives it the boost to 5, otherwise it would have been a yawning 3. Doesn't even have the feel of the 2008 iteration (which still reigns as goriest Rambo movie). It's not even close to 1 or 2 from the 80s. I will say the very end leads you to believe what almost had to happen, but doesn't actually confirm it does. Nothing after the credits (shocker there).",5.0,21 September 2019

Although cliche to a certain extent, it is interesting, if not as a character study, to watch what a man is capable of given the right push into the descent of unbridled rage! Honestly, based on the reviews gleaned, I wasn't expecting much, but for some reason I found the gore factor befitting to such a franchise, and even necessary, to display the cumulative affect of violence in a man's life. All the parties involved churned out a solid effort, and I would highly recommend a theatrical viewing for full visceral effect.",8.0,6 October 2019

With "" Last blood "" likely to being the final chapter I guess I had an unrealistic hope that they could somehow recapture the heart of the original.It saddens me to say that all involved have done it a great injustice.Its the weakest of all the John Rambo films. Predictable all round, clunky ,and even the normal dependable action left me feeling short changed.Stallone tries his best but he and the audience deserve a better send off.

Ending on a real whimper with this series,"Rambo: Last Blood is exactly what I thought it was gonna be. Predictable and played out in the safest way possible. Generic villains and a generic plot. From the trailer, you can guess everything that's going to happen in the movie. It has some fun Rambo kills and violence and Sylvester Stallone is all right; he has his moments. The best parts of the movie are the kills, traps and the violence. The movie is okay for what it is, it's not terrible, but nothing special. This is definitely Stallone's last foray into Rambo territory, although it's not the best ending to the character. It doesn't have the best plot points towards the end, but you get some mild amusement from it. By this point nothing seems to matter in the franchise since it's the 5th film. At this point, you just watch them for the violence. It seems to have a more blase ending to the Rambo character, unlike the Rocky movies which are treated with a little more dignity. Other than that, it's safe and predictable and you just watch it to waste 2 hours of your day, even getting some good laughs with the violence. It's worth it to see Rambo just killing more people for fun. It does have some fun 80s action schlock towards the end, and one moment I laughed pretty hard at that's straight out of a movie like Commando. If it was as fun as Commando, it'd be great.",3.0,28 September 2020

A Waste of a Rambo Movie. A Waste of a Movie. The 4th Rambo is the legitimate ending.,"Rambo is supposed to be about a man separated from ""the world"". A man who has drifted not just from everyone else but from himself, enough so that he can survive in a world that doesn't want him. Rambo is a solitary man, who eventually finds the moral ground. He is the grim reaper to anyone who stands in his way.

This movie is about a guy troubled by his past who happens to be good with traps and explosives. This is not about Rambo, but about some other military guy that could be anyone.

The series ended with Rambo 4 and truer to the character tale that pits Rambo against the militia of Burma. In that movie he warns missionaries not to go into the area they wish to go into , but they go anyways. The mercenaries then find the hell they were warned about, and Rambo comes to save the day. It wasn't the best plot but it was definitely more Rambo than this one.

Rambo is a guardian for his niece, who wants to go to Mexico to talk to her dad, warned by Rambo not to go, but goes anyways. Rambo then goes in to find her, get captured, beaten, then left for dead. Comes back with a vengeance to kill everyone in the most uneventful finale yet. The 4th installment at the very least gives us something to hate about most of the characters. This Rambo really only concentrates on a few. As for the rest we really don't care and thus it is just canon fodder.

Unlike all other Rambo movies the ending is a uninspired dud. Did not have to be. This is not corrected by the lame showdown at the end feels. Feels plastic and staged. No real tension. More like circus stunts.

As long as reality was not a factor in making this movie, they could have served up a better underdog story with an inspirational or uplifting ending.

"Its not Rambo, more like Taken but crap.","This is the most stupid movie I have seen in a long time. Its bad acting, bad writing, bad photography. Villains are one dimensional, and the plot is a Taken rip off of the bad kind.

The real John Rambo was a war vet that had a inner struggle between being a killing machine and survive as a human in a non war society. THAT movie was great. Even 2 and 3 were OK and after seeing this shit, even Rambo 4 is tolerable. This movie is a waist of time and insultingly bad, often the dialogue is so mumbled one could think Bane from the Batman universe took over Rambo's body.

One of those films where you wish they'd spent more money on getting good writers and a half decent story. Still, I feel sorry for Stallone cos he still seems to live in Schwarzenegger's shadow.

Not for' Rambo 'fans,"To say im a big fan of Sly and 'Rambo' is a huge understatement but this film i really struggled with. Started ok and thought Stallones acting was on point but after the first 15 mins its just all a bit silly. Unfortunately they have gone done the road of cliche drug cartel bad guys and stupid plot if you can call it one. Violence for Violence sake has just become mundane in movies. The ending was god awful comedy like nonsense and out of Rambos character in my opinion. Why cater for the masses with crap like this,when you have the masses on side already? First blood is where it all started and what brought everyone on board in the beginning ,so why go down the road of upping the body count to please brainless morons? 'First blood 'was a masterpiece because it was simple with brilliant characters. This is just a cliche ,bums on seats movie and not for 'Rambo' fans.

If you're ther person that like Rocky V you love Rambo V,"I hate to say this because I'm a huge Stallone fan, but this movie could have been called any genetic action title, but they chose Rambo and I'll never understand why. Had zero Rambo feel other than he called himself John Rambo. Hastily put together, no back story as to why he has tunnels under his entire ranch where he ""found peace"". Or where his family came from. 3/4 of the movie was lazy dialogue drama followed by what felt like a 2 min preperation montage and 12 min of action which was the only thing that saved this movie from a 1 star rating. If they'd have called it anything else it would have been a straight to DVD release, but to call it Rambo is an insult to a great franchise. But much like the 5th Rocky this one will be forgotten.

This movie was everything I wanted it to be. The depth and dimensions of this character are obviously not understood by some of these critics.

This is not a commentary on a particular culture, forget all that. This is John Rambo seeking revenge and carrying out and putting on display all his anger, all the betrayals he has faced and avenging the murder of one of the only people he ever possessed feelings for.

It is actually a tragic film about repeated loss and trying to quiet that sleeping lion inside all of us and trying to find peace in the absence of love and family.

It made me sad that the only solace he found after a life of hate, and bloodshed was stripped away and once again he ends up alone. I was quite emotional at the end of this film. All the revenge felt amazing and satisfying but my heart still breaks for John Rambo.",10.0,30 September 2019
A poor ending to the franchise! 3/10,"Review: I'm glad to hear that Sylvester Stallone (John Rambo), has finally put this franchise to bed because the franchise was drastically going downhill. Personally, I love First Blood but the rest of the films became a joke after a while. This movie doesn't even feel like it should be in the franchise because Rambo is really old and slow, and there is way too much dialogue, compared to the other movies. On top of that, the overdramatic music, terrible action scenes, and stiff acting proved that they should have left this franchise alone after the 3rd movie. There are some emotional scenes, which brought through the intensity element, but I'm not used to seeing Rambo getting his butt kicked. I know that it is set later on in his life and that he is battling with his demons, whilst trying to live humbly with new-found family, but that's why it didn't really seem like a Rambo film. It seemed more like a cheap TV movie, which won't be remembered, so they really should have put it to bed years ago. Anyway, the movie is set eleven years after the events in Burma, where Vietnam War veteran John Rambo lives in Bowie, Arizona in his deceased father's ranch, which he manages with his old friend, Maria Beltran (Adriana Berraza) and her granddaughter, Gabriella (Yvette Monreal). Gabriella reveals to Rambo that a friend of hers, Gizelle (Fenessa Pineda) has found Gabriella's biological father, Miguel, in Mexico. Against Rambo and Maria's wishes, Gabriella secretly drives to Mexico to ask why Miguel had abandoned her years ago. Gizelle leads Gabriella to Miguel's apartment, where he reveals that he never really cared for her, or her mother. Gizelle takes a heartbroken Gabriella to a local club, where Gabriella is drugged and kidnapped by enforcers of a Mexican cartel. Meanwhile, Maria informs Rambo of Gabriella's disappearance in Mexico. Rambo travels to Mexico and interrogates both Miguel and Gizelle about Gabriella's whereabouts. Gizelle reluctantly leads Rambo to the club where Gabriella was last seen and confronts El Flaco, the man who last spoke with Gabriella. A mysterious woman, Carmen Delgado (Paz Vega) tails Rambo as El Flaco leads him to Gabriella's location. Rambo is immediately confronted, beaten, and marked by the cartel, led by brothers Hugo (Sergio Peris-Mancheta) and Victor Martinez (Oscar Jaenada). They take his driver's license, revealing the ranch's location, and a photo of Gabriella, whom Victor recognises. The cartel vow to mistreat Gabriella further due to Rambo's actions. Carmen takes Rambo back to her home where she cares for him until he fully recovers. While Rambo is being cared for by Carmen, Gabriella is stripped and consistently dosed with heroin and sold to be raped repeatedly. Carmen reveals herself to be an independent journalist who has been investigating the Martinez brothers, the kidnappers and murderers of her sister. Rambo later raids one of the brothels, killing several men until he finds a drugged Gabriella. On the way back home, Rambo thanks Gabriella for giving him hope for ten years before she dies from the forced overdose. Enraged, Rambo sends Maria away and rigs the ranch with traps for a confrontation, and later returns to Mexico to ask Carmen's help in finding Victor. Carmen initially refuses, believing that it will solve nothing, but is convinced after Rambo appeals to her grief and frustrations. Rambo raids Victor's home, killing several guards and decapitating Victor. In retaliation, Hugo leads a group of hitmen to Rambo's ranch, where each falls victim to the rigged traps. Will Rambo get vengeance for Gabriella, and kill the evil Hugo? You have to watch the film to find out! As soon as the film started, I knew who was going to live and die, and I knew that Gabriella was going to cause trouble for Rambo. Personally, I can't remember the last decent Sylvester Stallone movie I've seen, so my expectations weren't that high, and it was sad to see Rambo go out like that. Although I grew up with his movies, I can't see a place for Sylvester Stallone movies anymore, which is sad because the Rocky movies, up the 4th, and First Blood are all-time classics. Maybe it's time to call it a day! Anyway, I was really disappointed with this film, and I think that you will find it cheap at your local petrol station soon. Disappointing!

Round-Up: This movie was directed by Adrian Grunberg, who also brought you How I Spent My Summer Vacation starring Mel Gibson. I'm surprised that he was chosen to direct the final Rambo because he lacks experience behind the camera. He didn't bring anything new to the project, but I liked the little montage at the end, which went through all of the Rambo movies. You get to see how much Sylvester Stallone has changed over the years, and it did make me want to watch First Blood again, but I won't be giving this movie a second watch.

ALL I WANTED WAS SOMETHING TO EAT,"We have come a long way from the Rambo First blood and now to Rambo last blood. I must say that I couldn't wait for the one and was disappointed by the other. Here is a guy that knows violence and how it works and can navigate in and out of it reasonably well. Here, I think he lacks the judgment necessary to act on what he has learned over the years and various encounters that helped refine his skills. I applaud the story of a man walking toward an uncomfortable situation but how and why he chose this way is what puzzled me. We are introduced to the second bite of the apple principal where someone gets a second chance. It could have been carried out better or eliminated completely considering this is Rambo who doesn't need a second chance when he knows the odds going in. Barring all that with all the money, power and pull Stallone has why couldn't the script be outstanding to the point where you want to see it again? There is no comeback experience here unless you are into pure raw violence but that can be had by any number of movies out there. Rambo deserved a better Last Blood methinks.

What were they thinking?!,"Rambo: Last Blood - a strange amalgam of ""Taken"" and ""Home Alone,"" and a sorry excuse for an action movie.

Do yourself a favor and don't watch the movie; in fact, avoid reading this review if you are prone to retching or descending into fits of fury at having wasted your senses reading about the latest iteration from a movie series (that you once loved) being reduced to the smell of a horses' behind.

Rambo, now domesticated, lives a quiet life in the Arizona countryside caring for his horses and two women, who, in turn, provide the normalcy that he had always craved. Being on the farm is dusty, smelly, but at least Rambo has clothes on his back - clean ones. So far, so good. But, Rambo being Rambo, spends his free time digging dimly lit tunnels under his property. For what nefarious purpose? I don't have to tell you.

Whereas ""Rambo: First Blood"" had heart, originality; ""Rambo II"" thrived on jingoism, cheesy but great action; ""Rambo III"" saw him fighting the dirty Russians; ""Rambo"" (2008) had shock and awe of the highest degree, ""Rambo: Last Blood"" has...nothing! Rambo is just there, in pictures on the wall, cleaning horses and keeping a lid on his second nature, which if you haven't guessed by now - is to kill, and kill he will. Where? You already know that.

What was Mr. Stallone thinking? The latest sequel in the Rambo series is devoid of any soul, substance, surprise, or self-respect. There is gratuitous violence for the sake of gratuitous violence. Why does the world need a mentally scarred, aging white soldier (again) to save civilians from the Mexicans in the most gruesome manner? The answer is simple - to get the audience to pay to watch a botoxed Mr. Stallone (with a weird-looking hairline) play the character of their fantasy a fifth time. The sad part is - John Rambo, a fictional Green Beret and a Vietnam veteran character from David Morrell's novel, a reluctant hero, who can fight his way out of extraordinary circumstances, has been reduced to a John Smith-looking-for-trouble-from-anywhere-town (as pointed out by an equally disappointed David Morrell, the creator of Rambo).

From script to direction, cinematography, action, acting, dialogues, everything about this production is atrocious. The fact that Mr. Stallone, a capable screenwriter, and film director himself, chose to be part of this ill-conceived sequel should be reason enough for him to retire from Rambo's character.",2.0,27 June 2020

Bloodlust,"The Rambo series may've begun in ""First Blood"" (1982) as a poignant examination of a Vietnam veteran's trauma and struggles to reintegrate into society, but, now, ""Rambo: Last Blood"" is simply exploitation fare. That'll be enough for fans of gory machismo fantasies, though, and, admittedly, it's intoxicating and even rather amusing in a so-bad-it's-good sort of way. After all, the entire production is in bad taste, but I can embrace that ethic to an extent. The narrative begins as ""Rambo"" meets ""Taken"" (2008), where the titular hero employs his ""very particular set of skills"" in the service of rescuing his adopted daughter. From there, it becomes a rape-revenge plot in the vein of the ""Death Wish"" series, concluding with a ridiculously-violent variation on ""Home Alone"" (1990).

Accompanying that generic formula, there's the conspicuous alignment with right-wing politics in the United States during the Trump administration regarding Mexico and immigration. Mexico's side of the border is depicted as a gang-infested city trafficking in sex slavery, whereas Rambo inhabits idyllic rural virtues to the north. Ultimately, he lures the baddies into a wall of bullets, mutilation and torture of his own design. This is a character--a walking, talking bloodbath--who has already and largely single-handedly won wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Myanmar, so securing the border seems par for the course.

Additionally, that the direction and script here otherwise are slipshod is almost irrelevant. The daughter, introduced for the plot here, is nothing more than a clich√©, for which it would be a challenge to be concerned about her fate if that were the point of this enterprise, as opposed to the real point of seeing 73-year-old Sylvester Stallone going on a bloody rampage. I understand that the tunnel business is supposed to recall Rambo's Vietnam past, but that, too, hardly matters except to help make the hero believably unhinged (which, it must be said, mission accomplished). The zoom focus shots and montages are prosaic, as well, but refined filmmaking would've been lost on this Rambo burger. What ""Last Blood"" does well badly it does excessively, but also within a thankfully-brisk runtime. On its own terms, the picture is a success.",5.0,11 January 2020

Leftovers,"This movie is sloppy. You can really tell that the editing has been done by several different people. It just lacks co-coherency. There is something wrong with the pacing towards the end, and also the whole subplot about the reporter makes no impact. It's like they had a more fleshed out part for her, but it ended up on the cutting floor. There are several scenes that could have been removed without interfering with the plot whatsoever, and at the same time it feels like there are several scenes missing that ARE crucial to the plot.

Also. This movie doesn't feel like a Rambo movie, because it doesn't sound like a Rambo movie. The themes that Goldsmith wrote for the original movies are not only iconic, they are amazingly good. I dare you not to get goosebumps when you hear those horns. Instead what we get here is a computer-made boring and generic TV-soundtrack and The Doors. I agree with the original author: that they could have named this movie 'John Smith' instead of 'John Rambo' and it would have made no difference.

Also. It's lacking the action. It's lacking he big guns, it lacking the explosions, it's lacking everything that we got in the early movies.

Also, also. It's just weird that all the suddenly he is hung up on the Vietnam war again. It's like this is suppose to be a sequel to the first movie where the second, third and fourth somehow didn't happen. Is this a sequel or a remake? It doesn't seem like the script writers really know either. And whats even worse, is that the don't seem to know what to do with the characters either. The bad guys are so 2 dimensional it's not even funny. BUT the worst, THE worst thing: Is that Stallone's character is 2-dimensional as well. He was so fleshed out and so believable in Rambo 2008. You could really feel how cynical and tired he was. Stallone did an amazing job acting in that movie and it's one of my favorites movies from the last 20 years. But this is just bad. And it makes me angry not only that this movie isn't that good, but it makes me angry because it could have been so much better. Brian Tyler can make a good soundtrack, Stallone can write a good script, Stallone can act, the entire team involved in this movie have the potential to make such a great movie and THIS is what they released?

Rambo the rancher should've stayed retired,"To put it plainly, there's no reason for Rambo: Last Blood to exist.

Adding nothing to the cannon of the story of war veteran turned one man army John Rambo, Last Blood is the type of heartless and pointless exercise that only the most die-hard and desperate franchise fans will enjoy, as the rest of us witness the now 73 year old Sylvester Stallone disappointingly rehash one of his most beloved creations for a story that barely passes the muster as an excuse for a ranch-owning Rambo to spill some more claret.

It's not like Stallone hasn't had success with bringing back past glories, Creed of course is one of his crowning achievements but Last Blood feels like a step too far as Stallone and director for hire Adrian Grunberg take us on a nasty, grim and charisma free affair that see's 60 - 70 minutes of screen time wasted on a Taken-lite Mexico adventure that very quickly turns into a gore-porn of epic proportions as Rambo takes it to a bunch of paper thin cartel bosses to enact revenge on them for crimes against his acquaintances.

The worst thing about Last Blood is somewhere in this concept is a potentially strong story about PTSD, family and finding one's place in the world, nothing original but certainly something more meaningful but with its sledgehammer approach to butchering any nuances or finer details of its narrative drive, Last Blood is like a bad 80's direct to video like action thriller that fails to justify any reason to have been made.

One thing Last Blood does do is remind us just how strong Rambo started out his life in First Blood in 1982.

A film that stands the test of time thanks to it actually creating a worthy story, a likable lead and some memorable set-ups, First Blood was a strong adaptation of David Morrell's character and the perfect fit for Stallone's particular style of acting but as was the case with the increasingly dwindling returns of later installments, Last Blood loses sight of what made its central character so appealing in the first place, to become nothing more than a mindless exercise in over the top set-pieces that mean very little once the credits begin to roll and you move quickly onto the next thing available to your viewing needs.

Despite hearts being ripped out of chests, shotgun bullets being turned into flammable cartridges and Stallone mumbling his way around some deep musings on growing old and past trauma's, Last Blood gives us nothing to remember other than an end credits montage that reminds us all of how far down the drain John Rambo has sunken in the past 30 plus years.

Final Say -

Slowly moving forward towards its insanely violent crescendo that offers zero surprises or benefits, Rambo: Last Blood is not the fitting farewell to a beloved cinematic creation that we would've liked, rather a desperately out of place offering that should never have been given the green-light in the first place.

As someone that openly wept at Balboa finally emptying the basement trying up Rocky this was anythimg but. The last Rambo as the boatman in Burma left this character closed out correctly, what I saw I waited patiently to see Stallone to head bad guy ""Sue me for what?"" after playfully extracting the mans heart which does nothing for the film as he is already dead.

The first time I looked at my watch I discovered six minutes left. This was not a good ""wow it is so full of action time flew"" it was ""six minutes left and this? When when will we see Rambo""

Epic horrific failure",3.0,19 September 2019

I'll keep this short, Rambo (much like Rocky) is one of my favourites of Sylvester Stallone and if you're a fan, then just go and watch it.

Fails to recapture the first film in the franchise.....,"There's a certain sense of irony, when a Rambo franchise film that calls itself Last Blood tries so very very hard, to recapture the First Blood film.

In my opinion the first film and only the first film, was, in fact, quite good. Driven, as it was, as much by a compelling human interest drama mixed with an action film.

Last Blood tries and fails, to achieve the same ends. Why? To my mind its because the first film had a story that had a certain plausibility about it. You could understand why and how the main character Rambo was led down a path by events not, in a sense, of his choosing.

By contrast, the latest film feels forced. It tries awkwardly to engineer a similar premise but its full of badly contrived plot elements. So much so,that it fails to gel into the overstated but nonetheless, believable, story found in the first film.

Worse still, the violence is of the brutal, sensationalist variety. Its ugly stuff dragging this sorry film even further away from the original story where Rambo used violence with a certain savage restraint.

Suffice to say, I hope this is the last film in this franchise. They are not improving with age. 4/10 from me.",4.0,7 October 2019

Give Up Sly .... Age has caught up with you,"Just about watchable but, rather like Clint Eastwood in The Mule, Sly just demonstrates that his acting days are at an end....... well OK, some might argue that they never really started, but this really does show that he should stick to directing or producing. The plot is extremely narrow, and predictable, and Sly's angry scowl seems permanently embossed on his face as if done with Botox. Right at the start we are shown his ranch, and using the very tenuous script we are shown exactly how and where this story will end. The movie also takes an extremely stereotyped and prejudiced position on Mexicans, which actually is quite nauseating ..... but clearly good for the inevitable death and destruction later. I would say if you enjoy wanton violence without having to stretch the brain cells, this one is for you ........ but not for me I'm afraid",3.0,25 September 2019

Should have stopped at the first one.,"I watched this movie with the sole purpose of experiencing some satisfying violence, and I didn't get that.

Everything else in the movie was boring and stupid. And it didn't help that Rambo acted completely out of character for a lot of the movie.

""First Blood"" was awesome. It was simple, contained, exciting, very well-acted, featured memorable characters, and it subverted expectations. Who was expecting the movie to end the way that it did? It's not flawless, but for an action movie it's pretty solid. And it makes for a good character study.

A revolution in action cinematography,"I've loved every Rambo movie and this is no exception. I now why some critics rate it low cause this movie is shockingly brutal. Stallone made this movie to showcase the brutality of violence and war and he basicly set a new standard with this movie.

Its not John Wick over the top action, but you get to see every bullet hit, every punch land and what it does to a body. When Rambo got angry i was genuinly afraid for the villains in this. It felt very much real and Stallone played Rambo perfectly here. Its not a clever story, you could say its just a simple revenge movie but this is the first time ive seen action this real. Stallone deserves praises for this movie and its sad to see critics rate it low because of the simple story when the movie sets a new standard for action movies to follow.

Last Blood Ruined The Last Entry,"Rambo: Last Blood opens with a thrilling sequence featuring an emotionally drained Sylvester Stallone. What starts off as a treat and worthy continuation to a beloved franchise, slowly turns into the one of the most disappointing films of the decade. The fifth installment features an unbalanced and poorly written script that abandons the messages, themes and entertainment values of the series. I'm fine with franchises taking a new direction, especially when it's five entiries in but you shouldn't have to sacrifice the character and story to do so. Overall Rambo: Last Blood does not respect what has come before nor does it offer a satisfying conclusion and that's why I will give this train wreck an extremely generous 3/10. If you are a fan of the John Rambo character and wish to see how his arc concludes, then please do yourself a favour and rewatch the fourth installment.",3.0,24 September 2019

An unprepared Rambo ends up killing the bad guys,"In the fourth installment of the series, Rambo lives on a farm and tries to be a good father figure to his teenage niece. When his niece locates her father in Mexico through a friend, she decides to pay him a visit and ask why he left her. Rambo asks her reconsider while her mother strictly forbids her from going ahead with those plans. In the end, the niece ends up in Mexico being kidnapped by human traffickers (√° la Taken-franchise).

It's funny to see Stallone using fragments from his Rocky character in order to portray Rambo giving good fatherly advice, as if Rambo hasn't really developed that part in himself.

So Rambo goes to Mexico armed with a knife and a gun and, as the trailer shows, eventually walks right into a large group of armed men responsible for taking his niece. He demands they let her go and, unsurprisingly, they refuse. The bad guys take great offence of Rambo demanding they release his niece and decide to make an example of both of them, perhaps as to discourage similar acts from others. Indeed, they're not impressed by Rambo's forwardness or his courage to stand up to them, and they really have no reason to. Rambo barges in unprepared, without a Plan B, or having a bargaining chip. And his enemy doesn't stop to ask if Rambo has a sidekick, or what the heck his deal is. A couple of lines of dialogue is enough for everyone to know where they stand.

And in the end, neither Rambo nor the bad guys seem to know what they're doing. There's no thinking involved, no strategy, just a bunch of guys being annoyed with each other, unable to predict each other's move.

Some would say that Rambo doesn't need a solid story and rich characters to be good (and they would be wrong); and besides, the first Rambo movie managed to offer those things--but even if we are to focus on the action scenes alone, these fall short. A few gunshots and stabs here and there are wrapped up with Rambo's trademark of setting up traps, but his opponents are so uninspired that such complexity is not really needed.

Rambo's enemy is too easy to kill, but, supposedly, Rambo prolongs their suffering to make a point. This takes away from Rambo's efficiency and adds adds nothing to the story.",3.0,24 September 2019

Then the film turns into Taken 4.....only John Rambo has none of the intelligence and skills required to hunt down his daughters kidnappers. So he proceeds to get his ass handed to him but then is inexplicably set free?????

Starts off promising, thought it would be some kidnap rescue in the woods, but no, it becomes some random revenge thing based in mexico & arizona.

The plot was weak, to the point of pathetic. I don't mean to suggest Rambo films ever have a strong plot, but at least they have believable acting mixed with some type of rationale. This movie had none of it.

I give it a 5 star because the film has Rambo in the name; I guess that's why it has Rambo in the name.

I sincerely hope Mr Stallone doesn't end the Rambo films, they were (still are) so much fun, but maybe at 73 he's lost the ability to spot the trash.

...and the trench, the huge trench network (you'll see early in the film, so no spoiler), he's been working on the farm 10 years, assuming he did work, he managed to build a massive network, in his spare time... only Rambo would be capable of such a thing (and chuck norris, who wasn't in the film by the way, but could have easily replaced Rambo)",5.0,29 November 2019

Just Like Shakespeare's Richard III!,"Rambo literally has no purpose anymore, because America is not at war anywhere. Fortunately, his reckless, impulsive, childlike teenage step daughter suddenly develops a craving to see Mexico . . . and her long lost father. Because everyone in Mexico is evil, she is immediately kidnapped and forced to become a sex slave, along with dozens of other zombie like females.

Rambo is at his best in the melancholy first act, where he keeps mumbling mush-mouthed sentences about how life has become purposeless. ""Now are our bruised arms hung up for monuments,"" he mumbles at one point, indicating a huge knife displayed on the wall of his man cave. ""Now are our stern alarums turned to merry meetings,"" he adds, when his daughter throws a party. The echoes of Shakespeare are obvious, and Stallone's distinctive diction renders each phrase more memorable than ever before. ""Grim visaged war, has, uh, smoothed his wrinkled front. And now, uh! Instead of mounting barbed steeds, to uh, uh, uh, fright the souls of fearful adversaries, he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber, to the lascivious pleasing of a lute."" I just wanted to see Rambo capering nimbly in the Mexican lady's chamber, to the lascivious pleasing of a lute!

Now I won't give away the plot, but why couldn't Rambo's step daughter have been a long lost Aztec princess? And why couldn't the men chasing her have been part of an ancient warrior cult hoping to revive the Aztec empire? That would have made the whole story more believable and dramatic.",2.0,4 September 2020

The movie begins with Rambo on a rescue mission of sorts. He's still suffering from past experiences, but manages a calm life on his ranch. Well, short story shorter (I would've liked the movie longer), his sort of adopted ""daughter"" goes missing, sending Rambo on a rampage, bringing the final fight to his ranch. Yes, Rambo doesnt really want to fight, he has always been drawn into it, in the previous movies. But he also always do the right thing, in his mind. So yeah the violence is bloody and gory like the one before. But war, violence IS bloody and gory... I'd rather see blood than nothing at all, like a PG13 rating. And I get the violence.

Some dialogues are cheesy, for one specific scene I'd add a lot more acting/emotion and some cuts were poorly executed; that's all anyone can complain about the movie. It is a Rambo movie, I paid my ticket to watch him ripping hearts off with bare hands, not to read a bible verse to the villains, hug and forgive them, and I got all I wanted to get. The action scenes are cool and they play in a way where he is Rambo, he's in charge. The story line is so simple that a friend who doesn't speak any English watched it with me and was able to understand what was going on, and that's a bonus, the story covers an universal feeling, love.

I have never seen this type of choreographed violence ever before captured on film. It goes by fast, is shocking, entertaining, and extremely satisfying if you are a Rambo/Stallone fan. In my opinion, it is a better movie than Rambo 3 and 4. The acting was improved from the last one (2008). If I had to be critical about anything it would be that some dialogue was cut out to keep the movie moving at a fast pace, and not have the first half of the movie run too slow. However, I really feel that this is an epic movie, perhaps the best revenge film ever made.",10.0,21 September 2019
Doesn't feel like a Rambo movie,"I have enjoyed all the previous Rambo movies, yes even Rambo 3, however this movie just didn't feel like a Rambo movie to me, it could have just been a Liam Neeson Taken movie with Sly Stallone in the lead role.

The movie felt rushed and I'm wondering if that was down to bad editing rather than the director. The plot has been done before hence my Taken reference and it offered nothing to the Rambo franchise, clearly this movie was made just to cash in on the name.

There is plenty of action and blood and guts as you would expect but overall I was left disappointed with the movie as a whole. There is a journalist character who briefly helps Rambo, however there was actually no point in having the character in the movie and the character could easily have been omitted without making any difference to the movie whatsoever.

Some things are best left alone and this movie fits into that category.",5.0,24 November 2019
Worse than you can imagine,"After reading the tagline and watching first fifteen minutes I thought this is going to be like Taken 4, with 70 year old Rambo. Is it cliche? Yeah! But who cares? I didn't expect anything but fun from this flick. After all you cannot expect a sensible story from an action movie. Accordingly you can live with certain plot holes.

But this one crossed the line. So many irrational decisions, terrible pace and dissatisfying revenge story in every level. Even if you're an action movie fan, I'd say stay away at all cost. It doesn't even deserve to be watched on dvd / streaming.",5.0,6 December 2019

POOR TASTE,"I think Sly has overstepped the mark with this one. Well made production but simply the wrong choice in vehicles to promote his long running character Rambo. The reality of the 'industry' may be accurately portrayed, I don't know, essentially the movie is about Rambo and his self styled form of vengeance. To use the horror of this 'business' to justify Rambo's brutality is plain wrong. In my view.",3.0,6 February 2021
Outstanding,"Apparently Rambo is too violent. He's a soldier who applies his training, what are the so called critics expecting?? Simply superb good old fashioned r rated action. Boy do I miss the eighties. Ps can't wait for the next installment. Psps the critics can stick to watching transformers and leave the grown up movies for real men.",10.0,23 September 2019
They did this film without Liam Neeson,"For a while, Rambo (2008) was intended to be the final Rambo film as it did come full circle. But you know how the movie industry is like. So in 2019, the released what is supposed to be the final Rambo film titled Rambo: Last Blood. The film was directed by Adrian Grunberg who does not have many directing credits to his name (as of the time of this review, he has three main directing credits). Sylvester Stallone once again wrote the screenplay for this film and once again stars in this film as John Rambo. Upon release, the film did rather well at the box office but this film manages to be the lowest grossing film in the franchise. Reception from critics were mixed with a lot of fans not being real pleased and even the author of First Blood hating this film. The film even won two Razzies. I remember the first time I saw the trailer for this film (and at this time I only had seen the first Rambo film) and I do remember being excited for the fact that it is a new Rambo film. But the excitement did not last long as I lost interest in wanting to see this film. It was only recently that I picked this film up on DVD at my local electronics store for about $3.

John Rambo lives on a horse ranch in Arizona. He has like a family with this women and her granddaughter. This granddaughter is Gabrielle. She is a typical teenager who lost her mom years ago and her dad left her. She really wants to go out and find her father but Rambo believes she should not. She goes to Mexico without Rambo knowing and ends up getting captured by the cartel who use her in sex trafficking. It is up to Rambo to go and save her.

Rambo: Last Blood is probably the worst of the Rambo films and for various reasons. For one, most of the film (about 80 percent or so) is most definitely not a Rambo film. As my headline for this review indicates, they did this film without Liam Neeson. Why did I say that? Because the plot is extremely close to the Taken films which star Liam Neeson. With that being said, I am not entertained by a large chunk of this film. Now, the last 20 minutes are amazing despite being the same old stuff but it is more entertaining than whatever came before it. The reason why this film disappointed fans was because of the first 80 or so percent of this film. Yes, the acting is fine for the most part. Yes, Sylvester Stallone literally could have played the same character with a different name and nothing about this film would have changed. Yes, the characters are not great. There is a character named Carmen who is entirely pointless in this film. Nothing new is done with the character of Rambo besides giving him a haircut and making him older. I do believe that at times that film tries to go back to it's origins in terms of Rambo's character but it does not go into full effect. The violence does appear early on but most of it is all in the last act. The violence in here is most definitely not on the same level as Rambo (2008), but I will say that this film is a close second. The last act is the best part of the film and was lots of fun to watch. I would even go on to argue that it was better than the last act of the previous film. Everything that should be in a Rambo movie for the most part is in this last act and this is where I finally see Rambo in this film actually be Rambo. With this being called Rambo: Last Blood, surely this film wraps up this series? To me, no it does not. Rambo (2008) seemed to do that fine. This film just ends and I don't feel any sort of satisfaction either. Again, I felt satisfaction in Rambo (2008). What a shame...

Rambo: Last Blood is a disappointment for me. Most of the film is slow and does not have what a Rambo film should have. That is until the last act which is really what saves this film from getting a lower rating.",4.0,13 January 2021
Rambo: The Slasher,,4.0,14 July 2022
A Movie for the Fans,"After going to see Last Blood with my Dad, and really enjoying it, I was curious what other people thought and went to look up reviews. I was happy to see that other fans really liked the movie, and not surprised to see that critics were ripping on it. One critic called it ""xenophobic"" Why? Because it portrays evil people who happen to be Mexican as evil? Or because it shows dangrous cities in Mexico as having a problem with sex trafficing and drugs? One review even said that it didn't show the beautiful scenery that Mexico has to offer; as if every movie involving white criminals makes an effort to show a charming corner shop in the crime ridden neighborhood or the beautiful local parks. Basically the movie isn't politically correct so the critics hate it. Last Blood, like every other Rambo movie, is dark and gritty and the landscape and aesthetic mirror that grittiness. Last Blood isn't trying to make a statement about politics. The Mexican cartel is simply notoriously violent and ruthless which makes them a perfect foe for Rambo. Don't let the critics keep you from going to see the movie.

Last Blood is definitely a movie for the fans, as it should be. I think I was one of the only fans in the theater who was under 40 and probably the only female. The main fanbase is men who have been fans since First Blood came out nearly 40 years ago. Those loyal fans deserve an epic, bloody, true to form Rambo film and that's what last Blood is. It changes up the formula a little, being a revenge flick rather than the previous movies about him running from the authorities or rescuing villagers, but it's a formula that suits Rambo well. The movie also does a good job of addressing Rabmo's old age while still having him kick ass. His home alone style horse ranch of horrors is not only reminiscent of First Blood but allows him to hold his own against the entire cartel. But don't worry there is still plenty of up close action where we get to see Rambo go toe to toe with his foes. All in all, it is simply a fun, fan pleasing, action packed revenge thriller, that doesn't try to be something that it isn't. I highly reccomend to any Rambo fan or anyonw looking for just a fun action movie!",10.0,21 September 2019
Once upon a time there was a rambo!,"A watchable film, action with admixtures of drama, a very rounded and clear plot that takes place quite quickly, which is not very good when it comes to this type of film. This Rambo isn't ""that"" Rambo we used to watch no matter how hard they tried to portray it, it is obvious that this is no longer what it once was. The first obvious thing is the age of the main actor and his mobility, the scenes he is faced with he obviously unable follow taht ritm physicaly. John Rambo from 2008 was a bit close to those first parts, but even then it was obvious that it was actually out of the originality and away from previous more successful films, especially now. All in all the film is watchable but there are a lot of scenes that spoil the experience. This is one below average action movie with a touch of drama, nothing special!",5.0,27 January 2021
It's a Rambo flick not a romantic comedy,O sincerely don't understand all the fuss. The room was packed and everyone seemed to have enjoyed the movie.

A treat for the fans.,"Just finished Rambo last blood and have to say it was everything I had hoped for. I grew up watching these movies so its important to get everything right, and I have to say they did. The story isn't at all complicated but doesn't need to be and basically serves as a launching pad for possibly the most psychotic version of Rambo we've ever seen. By that I mean that we get to see a version of Rambo that has finally found some small amount of happiness, (although he's struggling to keep a lid on the rage inside) so when this is taken away you know whats coming, and I can assure you its brutal. The bad guy's in this movie are pure evil and deserve whats coming to them, and I can honestly say that true vengeance is delivered and is 100% satisfying. The acting is spot on by all, especially Stallone, who gives us his most animalistic, slightly psycho Rambo yet, and you're rooting for him the entire time. Its a good finale for a beloved character and a real treat for fans of the franchise. 10/10",10.0,23 September 2019

"Save the best to last, heartbreaking and brutal","To survive a war, you gotta become war, what you call hell he calls home. Welcome to the last Rambo film review where Rambo is forced to take on the cartel in the most brutal chapter that almost rivals Rambo 4 brutality.

After Rambo four John we see john finally come home to his family ranch, where he spends the rest of his life in peace raise his Niece Gabrielle played by Yvette Monreal, with her mum, While most review will tell you that this doesn't feel like Rambo because he hasn't moved on from the past, the film clearly shows that John is suffering from PTSD and he trying to let go of the past but it difficult for him.

Even though Rambo might look old now he still shows that he, not a man to messed with, boy does this film get Brutal especial toward the middle of the 2nd act and the 3rd act holy hell. While you might think that the set just comes out of nowhere it has no real direction, the motive is there and its come with a heartbreaking moment, here where we see john just snap into the Rambo we all know and love.

It every word he says you know death is about to be busy because the body count is about to rise. One thing this film shows is just how incredible of an act Stallone is which you only have to look all his film in his career since the 80s, show what a great director he is as well.

Action scene and Chorography of the final battle on the Ranch was just incredible to watch, but if you hate the sight of blood, you're gonna hate the third act, as it gets seriously brutal. Got say for the last Rambo film that I grow up watching for the 80s, this was a fitting ending to the series of films that give a great ending and a send-off to the iconic character John Rambo.

While ive seen most reviews using the political that it's is culturally insensitive to portray Mexico with drugs and cartel, yes im looking at you IGN, clearly you have no understanding that Mexico is basically run by the Cartel because they fear them, so it's not culturally insensitive to portray reality.



Dislikes: The only thing I found was a little pointless was Paz Vega character Carmen Delgado, it's a character that doesn't really go anywhere other than to push the story forward in key places, I think her character should have been writen better to have more involvement with Johnin some way.

Just felt like a throw-away character.",9.0,19 September 2019
Could have been amazing 10 years ago,"The only saving grace here is the hard R-rating and a few cool scenes.

Solid bloody action,"The fifth part of the series about the legendary John Rambo, at first glance seems a little too much, especially after so many years that have passed since previous films. Unfortunately, this is the first one that was not good for me. I often had deja vu while watching a movie. At first I thought I was watching a cheap copy of the movie Taken, and later I was watching a bloody copy of Home Alone. I better say Home Stallone, hahaha sorry. I see the problem in the script because we don't have a good story or quality characters, they only appear briefly, do their duty and that's it. It takes too long for the film to actually start being Rambo. The real bloody action actually happens in the last 15 minutes or so. It wasn't as catastrophic for me as it was for some critics, but it didn't delight me, a slight disappointment.",5.0,16 June 2022
The Last Two Rambo Films Were My Favorites,"Maybe I was too young to really enjoy 'First Blood' the way other people have. It's good, but the Rambo character is just a mess. Years later, in 'Rambo' (2008), he is fully developed, intelligent, and even profound at times. The effects were better, the pacing was better - as the years passed, Stallone learned how to make better movies with better characters.

'Rambo: Last Blood' (2019) feels more like a follow-up to 'Rambo' (2008) than the 5th movie in a franchise. I enjoyed the modernized plot and the 'old man Rambo' feel. He gets his *ss kicked early to add some realism to an overall unrealistic and over-the-top film. Despite the ridiculous final 20 minutes, I enjoyed it. This movie has everything you watch a Rambo movie to see. Solid effort.

The very core of John Rambo is missing.

What to expect in a Rambo movie other than violence?,"If you grew up watching Rambo movies, this one is a blast! Don't give a crap about critics. All I have to say to the critics is why the hell do you concern about political views and too much violence? Why can't you just enjoy the action and the legendary character and walk away? If you can't handle violence, watch a Disney movie and write a review on that. This is Rambo. Not some drama movie. Even though the plot is thin, the action is a little bit over the top this time when compared with Rambo (2008).

I have been waiting for a sequel since 2008 and I have to say this was so damn brutal and satisfying because Rambo is a one man killing machine and that's what he does best. No regrets. Hats off to Sly.",10.0,20 September 2019

"Excuses, excuses...","So while watching this film, I couldn't help but get the feeling Sly and his team just wanted to make a slasher flick using the Rambo character. The story is basically Taken, with a little less nuance and a ton more blood (this is actually a good thing!). The first half drags as the film really wants us to care about the characters in John Rambo's quiet life. This was actually done quite effectively and Yvette Monreal does a great job with her character. Our antagonists are totally generic and probably too much time was spent with them for no reason. The inclusion of the journalist remains a mystery along with the Don as they add minimally to the story. The last half of the film is basically Home Alone meets Jigsaw. They setup some traps, and show them going off. It's simple but effective. When our ""hero"" does come face-to-face with the villain though, some comedic stuff happens that I couldn't help but laugh out loud at for a good 3 minutes. It's almost worth sitting through the entire film just for that. It's bloody, it's gory, it has a little heart and one thing is still certain at the end...John Rambo is still the man! The tonal shift can be jarring if you're not a fan of blood (although, then why are you watching Rambo) and the first half can be quite a slog if you're looking for action.",5.0,9 December 2019
too many people are PC today,"What it boils down to is that the movie is too offensive for today's current political climate and as always it's a small minority of people who are massively offended making all the noise when I guarantee that 90% of the population really don't care. To me, it's ridiculous that people are crying out about the violence in the film when it's always been a part of the franchise. The problem is that people are putting their own political beliefs onto the movie.

Who goes to a Rambo movie, Expects a Rambo movie, they get a Rambo movie and then are annoyed that its a Rambo movie?

LAST BLOOD...Until he gets a blood transfusion and comes back in another 11 years...,"OK so this movie it TAKEN. like literally. Its TAKEN set on the border. Maybe with a dash of HOME ALONE or the third act of SKYFALL. Either way this is Rambo: Last Blood. Stallone is back as Himself...or Rocky..... or John Rambo. It doesn't really matter anymore, they all seem like the same person at this point. This one feels the least like a Rambo movie, in that it doesn't take place in the heart of a war, or somewhere overseas. Even the first was like a mini war out in boonies of Washington. The conflict in this one is more close to home, more personal. In Last Blood, we find Johnny leading a life of peace in Arizona. But he is soon lured back into action when a girl close to him is kidnapped by the Cartel. Rambo goes commando to go and get her back. Then he kicks ass and blows up...Its A solid enough movie. I didn't find that it quite reached the levels of wonderful over-the-top brutality of the last one, which was all I was hoping for in this movie. But the action is still pretty good. I think the overall film holds up a little better than the last one , the narrative, the filmmaking. I don't know. There really hasn't been a good Rambo movie since 3 in my opinion.

While I won't claim that any of the Rambo movies have great or lasting cinematic merit, I will say they are fun, and, to some extent, I suppose you could say I'm a fan of the series. The first entry, ""First Blood"", is far more dramatic than one might expect, but it's actually a decent movie. ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" is where the series finds its legs and starts to stand as the hardcore action series it's known as today; that entry actually has some decent action and it's kind of a perfect time capsule of 80s action. ""Rambo III"" is just ridiculous; it's where the series starts to loose its focus, but I's also really dumb fun. The fourth entry, titled only ""Rambo"" is alright; it's essentially just a remake of ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"", except it's set thirty years later and is infinitely more violent and gorier than the other earlier entries in the series. It had been ten years since the last Rambo, and I was interested to see what Stallone could bring to the table for this 'final' entry (if there's still money coming in, they'll make more). I wasn't expecting much, but this was worse than I expected. Even if you've already seen all the other Rambo movies, you don't need to see this one. It comes off as incredibly schmaltzy, almost to the point where it felt like a parody of the rest of the series.",3.0,6 December 2019

What a gory mess,"It's too bad they decided to revive the series with this horrible flick. It's gruesome murder porn. I can usually find entertainment from movies like this, accepting the nonsensical plot, but this was just too much. I cringed the first death or two in the ending showdown but by the end, I was just rolling my eyes as they tried to repeatedly one-up themselves with each new face deforming, body exploding murder. The first Rambo movie I would have zero interest in ever watching again.",1.0,12 July 2022

Don't Bother Watching This Unless You Speak Spanish.,Film starts well with the usual Rambo superhero action sequences designed to show the audience exactly what a hero he is. Unfortunately once he has had his credentials established a great deal of the dialogue is spoken in Spanish with no subtitle translation. As I don't speak Spanish I was at a loss for what if anything may have been said that was significant. The action does tend to speak for itself in this type of film but the lack of a decent dialogue takes so much from it that it ruined the experience.,5.0,17 December 2019
Which franchise did we just pay respects to?,"I stand tall when saying that ""First Blood"" is a legendary creation and the fourth installment is the bloodiest but still incredibly Ramboish, to be honest I was incredibly interested in what will happen after the ending of the last movie. With all that past behind John's shoulders the ride into the sunset cannot possibly be bland, right? Right?

The character of Rambo has been forged in fire and blood. This makes retirement pretty rough as, especially in his case, it is not the first try to escape the horrors of war. I can only imagine what ghosts haunt this ultimate killing machine but even this cannot give a solid explanation on what he has created on his ranch.

Anyway we can see that there was an attempt to humanize John Rambo and give him a reason to live peacefully, but then every reason became too rough and exaggerated. I still remember graphic flashes from the fourth movie, but flying limbs and explosions everywhere were part of the show and were kind of justified. Here the dark tones of cruel reality disgust and depress you, the more the better. As the bigger evil John faces the more we will praise his victory.

I will not stop on the acting as it has stopped probably 10 percent into the scene. Let's go to the juiciest part, I mean it - juiciest as at some point directors of slasher movies started crying somewhere in the corner. Not once we heard that the dark twisted soul of John Rambo is not out yet only because he does his best to keep a lid on it. But the outcome is worse than I expected. Instead of giving a tribute to one of the manliest and bravest action heroes of all time we wander into a fusion of John Kramer and Kevin Maccalister.

I appreciate the desire to give us the last glance at the legend, but after all if I knew that it would be like this I would have taken a mysterious future of John Rambo that my mind have started paining after seeing him walking towards the ranch.",3.0,21 February 2020

Taken from Liam,"Trust me, John; if he calls you, don't take his call. See, he's got a very particular set of skills...

Not sure the beef with this movie. It was 100% what I expected from beginning to end. Well, aside from one surprise mid-way and how much of a rip-off this is of Taken, I was satisfied because I expected no more, no less.

Synopsis: Taken, South of the Border. More specifically, Vet John Rambo watches over his maid and maid's daughter as if she was his own. When she rebels against her guardian's wishes not to seek out her real father in Mexico, she gets kidnapped and placed in the call girl trafficking school. If you ever heard of John Rambo, you know he's not gonna stand for that!

Did this feel like the last Rambo saga? Sure. Was it Sly's Rocky Balboa? Oh, hell no. It wasn't even as good as 2008's Rambo and that was just serviceable at best. But, because it was everything you know you'll see, it's worth a viewing on Prime.

But, not for kiddies. This outdid several Saw movies on the gore and excessive death scenes. Shocked this wasn't NC-17. If that is still a thing.

"Tired, predictable and boring","This was supposed to be the great ending of the Rambo franschise, but sadly it did not go out with a bang but a sad belly dive into the nothingness.

The idea of the movie is just as non imaginative as any other low budget action movie with the exact same theme: Avenge the bad druglords that killed daughter/relative. The only exception is that this was done with much bigger budget ... but still did not manage to deliver any kind of credibility. Maybe some people will like this movie, but in my opinion .. it should have ended with the fourth movie. It was much more thought through and in the fictive world of John Rambo, a much likely ending.

I would strongly suggest that you do not watch this movie .. just as you should not watch past half of the Rocky 4 movie - that is halfway through the fight with Dolph and Sly being truthfully outboxed.

Just an aging soldier,"RAMBO: LAST BLOOD RATING: 2.9/5

You'll be glad to know that there's no sign of Rambo chanting, ""Build that wall"" in this movie. LOL This is definitely not a pro MAGA movie the way some critics would have you believe. People seem to forget that Rambo has killed people all around the world. He's an equal opportunity killer. There's nothing racist about taking out a bunch of Mexicans that deal in human trafficking and prostitution. I mean, the cartel have been generic bad guys in film for decades. People acting all shocked and offended almost speaks to their ignorance of bad guys in film and Rambo movies in general. I don't know what else to tell you. At most, i guess you could get offended that some of the people in Mexico dress like those HOMIES toys they used to sell in the 90s. ü§£

Anyways, storywise, this isn't the best Rambo movie. After the last film, he's pretty much settled down on a farm, living with a Mexican niece and her Gramma. Things are pretty slow until the niece decides to go see her absentee father across the border before she finally takes off for college. Rambo and the gramma warn her against it but she goes anyways and winds up getting kidnapped. Once Rambo gets the call that she's been kidnapped, it's time to jump into action and save her.

Once in Mexico, it's all pretty generic and by the numbers. There's some story elements that are introduced, like a Mexican journalist, that never really goes anywhere. She only serves to keep the story moving forward and doesn't have any kind of real story arc. I thought she was wasted. You see the police that seem to just stand by and let the bad guys do what they want, implying that they're on the take, but it's never explored. It's weird how many elements don't get fleshed out considering how much exposition the movie feeds you gearing up for the big action sequence in the last 20 minutes of the film. It literally turns into the movie HOME ALONE but with Rambo, and it gets pretty gruesome.

Rambo: Last Blood is really just for diehard fans of the character. They know what they're there to see and so does Stallone... kinda. Weird thing is, with a few tweaks to the script here and there, they could have had something with a little more meaning. As is, it's fine. Average at best and that's mainly because the final action sequence drags it into average territory, but i have a feeling that's all some fans need. If they do make a sequel, hopefully they'll put some real thought into it and give Rambo a more proper sendoff.",5.0,25 September 2019

"Gritty, Brutal, and an old school action film that delivers.","Rambo: Last Blood (4 out of 5 stars).

Rambo: Last Blood is a gritty, bloody, and another revenge predictable story which has John Rambo facing against bad guys who are sex trafficking in Mexico. Being the fifth Rambo film in the series, you can not expect anything more but a simple thin plot that just gives Sylvester Stallone to come up with creative traps and gritty ways to kill the bad guys. Which is just what you can expect in this fifth film. Simple and predictable story. But the action sequences are great, gritty, and exciting.

The plot follows Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) living the quiet life in a ranch. He lives next to his niece and his old friend Maria. When his niece Gabrielle wants to go to Mexico to find her dead beat father that walked out of her and her mother's life. She gets kidnapped and sex trafficked by a group of bad guys. Rambo heads down there to rescue her which gets the attention of the bad guys to come back to his home. Which he has set a trap for them.

The plot is thin and predictable. Rambo lectures Gabrielle about the dangers of the real world that she has yet to experience. Fresh out of high school. Her ignorance has her leaving the ranch anyways to see her father. She makes the stupid decision to see her shady friend in Mexico. After being upset about seeing her father. Her friend convinces her to go to a club. Which you can tell what is about to happen next.

If you could put aside the weak story. The revenge concept builds the suspense and thrills seeing Rambo going in a territory were he is alone and defenseless when he is surrounded by a gang of guys. The film works great with its brutal fight scenes and action. Which is definitely what you can expect in a Rambo film. Rambo using nearly every weapon from hammers, knifes, arrows, and guns. There are some cringing moments when he digs his finger inside a guys knife wound to pull a bone out. It is what you can expect. A mindless brutal action flick which does its purpose to entertain.

Sylvester Stallone does great playing the veteran soldier of Rambo. Even though, the story has been weak in those films. The action is always worth the price of admission. I will love to see another sixth film with Stallone playing the character. The villain is underdeveloped in the film but just like every bad guy in every movie. You don't really need to know anything more besides they will face against Rambo's wrath.

Overall, Rambo: Last Blood is a good action thriller. The plot is predictable and weak just like another revenge thriller type. Sylvester Stallone does great at what he does. The action sequences are brutal, gritty, and intense. The showdown at his ranch is very exciting to see him take down a gang of bad guys.",8.0,20 September 2019

Not the legacy that Rambo should have left behind! [+34%],"Rambo: Last Blood, unfortunately, doesn't hold a candle to the rest of the films in the franchise. It plays out like a generic action film that goes 'guns, weapons, and gore'-blazin' in its finale. While it did give hints of Rambo's persistent inner turmoil, Last Blood is not the gory legacy that Rambo would have wanted to leave, in my eyes. It's the Max Payne 3 of the Rambo series - there's practically no real purpose for its existence, yet the only reason it does is to give its titular character a proper goodbye. I'm sure Last Blood fails to hold up that end of the bargain either. It simply feels like the end of another chapter in John's life.

The storyline isn't one we'd want to watch a character like Rambo in. There are scenes that justify its R-rating and gorehounds should be reasonably pleased with the final 20-minute action set-piece, even if it all barely registers. Stallone's performance isn't one to be blamed here; every character other than his felt stock and underwritten. The antagonists are the worst: they're so tiringly one-note than even the laziest action screenplay writer can do a lot better. Some might contend that the climactic R-rated Home Alone-esque showdown is probably what this franchise needed more of, but even then, the set-piece doesn't feel utterly fresh and innovative.

You can replace John Rambo with any of Liam Neeson's action-movie characters from the last decade and the film wouldn't play out any differently. That's how plain the writing here is. If 'brutal violence for the sake of brutal violence' in cinema is your cup of tea, then there's a faint chance that you may find Last Blood a wee bit entertaining. For everybody else, I doubt it! I love the John Rambo character and I remember cheering the hell out for his Burmese outing. But Last Blood just doesn't comprise the expected jolts that (the supposed final entry of the) franchise badly needed.",3.0,2 December 2019

Over the years watching his character grow and develop, you learn to truly understand the impact of War and the effect is has on one individual.",10.0,1 October 2019
The critics are wrong...,...if you're a Rambo fan. This is the closest of the films to First Blood and takes the forest scene of First Blood to another level. Rambo is monosyllabic- that is who he is - but that doesn't make him stupid or heartless or immoral. I have no idea what sort of film Stallone would have had to have made here for the critics to like it... whatever... ignore those idiots and revel in a last stand for Rambo.,10.0,25 July 2020
One of the finest final battles in a revenge movie I have ever seen,"Low expectations can hugely increase the enjoyment of some movies it seems and ""Rambo: Last Blood"" is probably one of the most striking examples of that. I already knew going in, that fans were disappointed by the movie. I already knew, that Sly himself had apologized to the fans for letting them down and dropping the ball on it Not to mention what all the critics thought. So I figured, what the heck, let's see how bad it is then.

Admittedly based on the initial 2/3 of the movie, I was ready to give the movie 5 stars out of 10 at best and often wondered, why is this even a ""Rambo"" movie, as things were progressing painfully slowly, not much was going on for large parts of it and the few action scenes were mostly just the odd regular beating up in a dark alley which could have come from any movie. Mostly it seemed to be a sort of ""Taken"" movie with Sly standing in for Liam Neeson and lumbering around in some Mexican shanty-town.

Well, little did I know, that all of this was just a buildup to make the audience really, I mean REALLY start to hate the despicable baddies of the cartel, so that when they make the mistake of going after Rambo and meet their inevitable, gloriously varied and satisfyingly gory demise (I assume it is not a spoiler to say that baddies die in a ""Rambo"" movie), it turns into one of the most satisfying final acts I have ever seen. Having been at best lukewarm throughout most of the movie and found some if it even questionable, I even surprised myself to be hollering and cheering for Rambo and fistpumping with a ""hell yeah!"" each time another cartel thug was impaled, dismembered or blown up into a red mist of showering intestines in what was probably one of the most climatic ""one man vs an army of bad guys"" final battles in a revenge movie.

With most of the movie being 5/10 but the final battle being 10/10, I give the movie an overall score of 8/10.",8.0,9 May 2023

Old School Action,"I won't lie to you, soon as I read plot story for a new Rambo film, and after RLB received negative reviews from so called professional critics, in my mind immediately appeared thought why is like that. I knew right away, this movie is going to be awesome. You may ask yourself why, and I'll let you know. This film deals, in large part, about human trafficking from Mexico. So basically you can get the idea why new Rambo got such a harsh reviews. In these times, you are not supposed think the way you want, but rather what media serves you. Once you go against their narrative, you are labeled with a lot of titles and you stick out as a sore thumb. I didn't mean to politicize film review, but they left me no option. Now as for the quality of the film, I can tell you that you don't have to expect Matrix style plot. If you go to see a Rambo movie with expectations of a plot from Quentin Tarantino flick, and you get disappointed, then excuse me, but you are dumb. This is old school action movie and it is made as such. Stallone is simply brilliant as one of the most iconic action characters ever put on big screen. We who grew up in the age of action films of the past decades will know. It's our legacy. Rambo Last Blood is a film about revenge. It is also a middle finger to the PC culture we're living in. It's about justice and doing what is right. It's simply beautiful. Legendary score, brutal action and specially ending credits will give you tears in the end! I know this is supposed to be truly last one in the series, but I wholeheartedly hope to see one more! Rock on Sly! 10/10.

They Drew First Blood,"The fifth installment of the John Rambo saga, with brutal violence and an angry Rambo who spares no one.

The film is really brutal, the violence is extreme and graphic, but it's Rambo, that's to be expected.

Sylvester Stallone embodied Rambo excellently, and managed to bring the rage to the big screen. I watched both versions of the film, I think there are only two, and I prefer the longer version.

There is more story and more dialogue and the film is more complete. In addition, in the longer version we can understand Rambo much better and find out some more things about him, which makes the film more interesting.

I honestly didn't like the ending, but overall, the movie is not bad. It's worth watching Rambo in a brutal campaign where he once again shows how dangerous he can be.

This is probably the last chapter in the story of this iconic character. Brutal violence, chaos, revenge and bloodshed, these are the best words to describe this film.

Definitely a movie worth watching.",8.0,14 December 2022
Home alone with Ole' Stallone,"Going back to his roots of warfare in Vietnam Rambo uses booby-traps to take out the Cartel and for this it works. Rambo is t a young soldier, he is an older man but with age comes wisdom. He can't be running around against young fighters, he need to be stealthy. Loved the niece I feel like she played the part well. The plot was week but out of a Rambo film it works.

If TAKEN or JOHN WICK are your kinda movies then LAST BLOOD will be a treat for you!,"Finally another TAKEN type revenge movie of quality.

You will leave utterly satisfied and with that overwhelming sense at the end that justice was served like with TAKEN. The reason being, is because these 2 films in particular really set up their movies with a concise and meaningful and heartfelt introduction to the characters involved, which includes our John Rambo.

The movies pace is very well timed, just like the 2008 Rambo movie, it builds swiftly and dangerously with story and action right up to the big finale, which was the best desert to a very well made and tasty meal!

I would wholly recommend this movie to fans of the Rambo franchise, the Taken franchise and the John Wick Franchise, as this is on their levels of revenge movie, Rambo style brutal! When Rambo swings at a bad guy you feel his vengeance deep in your soul when he connects!

Yes, he looks a bit jaded, and he decidedly doesn't take his shirt off to ripple those oiled muscles, as they would most probably wobble feebly, not ripple. But when he unleashes his ""inner darkness"", he makes up for muscle tone with blood and guts. Even my son, desensitized as his generation is, found some of the scenes over-the-top. Wrath has no limits in this geriatric revenge spree. The recipe of Clint Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"" and Liam Neeson's ""Taken"" franchise works well. Stallone actually acts better than I anticipated in this movie. Never too late to learn, I guess. I loved the scenes in the end credits, celebrating the other Rambo movies.",8.0,12 December 2019

A solid Rambo entry but not much of a finale,"So most of the critics are dogpiling on this one, no surprise there considering every Rambo after the original got bad reviews too. The plot here is the one that Stallone considered for the fourth one in 2008, before deciding to do the Burma story instead. As a result it feels like another self-contained Rambo adventure, nothing wrong with that but considering they called it Last Blood it doesn't feel like you're watching the grand sendoff of an iconic character (compared to Rocky Balboa, for example). I also think Rambo's best when he's in the jungle or woods, but that's just me.

Drawing Lots Of Blood,"He's the man with a mug and muscles. A legendary collection of characters whose stories continue to hold their place in history and face the test of time. Surprisingly, he manages to continue putting those stars of decades past into the modern times so that they can continue to rake in the attention, fame, and potentially tell a story doing it. I'm talking about Sylvester Stallone, the one-man action star who despite the passing years still does what he can to bring the boom. Tonight's feature is an unretired action legend that decades ago sunk his knife into our hearts, and now years later, he's trying to do it again with modern tools. What is in store? Well that's where I come in to give some insight as Robbie K is back with another look at:



LIKES:

Stallone's character still adapting Great use of cinematography to get the feeling Touching Side of Rambo The Rambo Action Package At The End Montage

DISLIKES:

Predictable Lacking Depth Wasted Characters Lame Villains First hour is clich√©, simplistic build up A Little Too Much Focus Of Blood Inconsistencies in this film's logic

The VERDICT

Overall, Rambo: Last Blood has the same simplistic approach the rest of the movies have done, but they did not quite execute as well for me. The story elements were sacrificed for superficial components, and the definition of action packed is a little different from my worldview. Sure, it's all about building up a justified tale of vengeance, and it does open up the side of Rambo that is outside the rugged stoicism that he loves. Yet, the modern take of extreme, weak villains, underutilized characters, and focus on the blood took away from the balance the first film did so well. Still, I'll agree with my fellow reviewers that if you are a die-hard fan and want the modern technology to blend with it, this fil is for you. All others, I would hold out for, and for everyone please don't take those that are too young to this blood fest.

My scores are:

Action/Adventure/Thriller: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",8.0,21 September 2019
Excellent and brutal,"Stallone looks every bit as fearsome as he always was as John Rambo; he's 73, but remains well-muscled and he throws that muscle around in believable ways. Cartels are widely despised, evil organizations, so it's great cathartic fun watching Rambo dispatch them with brutal precision and intensity. The last scene is an obvious reference to Aztec culture, the Mexica, from which the cartels are derived, taking their ritual barbarisms to new heights the last several years in modern Mexico.

The acting is serviceable and the cartel leadership is ably vile and sleazy. They get all they deserve and then some. If you like Rambo movies, you'll LOVE this one. 9/10",9.0,2 November 2019

Messy,"Everyone who sees a Rambo movie should know what they're getting themselves into. It's going to be a messy, messy trip with blood 'n guts everywhere. And this film doesn't provide that on a discount. You want to watch bad guys die in the most gruesome, messed up ways possible? Here ya go.

John Rambo has been living with an adoptive family for 10 years, and spends his time trying to keep his demons from his past at bay. One day, his adoptive daughter decides to go look for her father in Mexico and doesn't return, leading Rambo to go find the only family he's got left, and to bring out the killing machine that lives within him.

The initial reviews of this film are more ridiculous than a runway outfit. They say this film promotes a republican's agenda of border security. Well I'm gonna say it out loud, libs - The cartel and a lot of Mexican gangs are exactly as they are portrayed in the films. They have done worse things than what Rambo does to them in the films, because Rambo is about killing his enemies quickly, whereas the cartel wants their victims to suffer and they want to scare anyone from stopping them.

This movie isn't meant to push a political agenda. it's meant to send our favorite mentally unstable Vietnam veteran on his way. Sly rocks the role even as an old man and i'm glad he's doing so.

Amazing Film,"I was really unsure if this movie would carry on well from the previous Rambos with there been such a gap between this and the last.

However how surprised was I. This is such an amazing film, can't wait until the new Rocky film comes out, Stallone is one of the actors I remember really well from my childhood.

"Rambo's back, and he's grumpier than a constipated porcupine","So, Rambo's back, and he's grumpier than a constipated porcupine. He's living on a ranch in Arizona, probably raising cacti and practicing his knife-throwing skills on tumbleweeds. But wait, there's a twist! Rambo's got a niece named Gabrielle, and she's off to college. Yeah, college-the place where dreams go to die and student loans multiply like horny rabbits. Rambo's all like, ""Here's a letter-opener, kid. It's also a knife. Don't get kidnapped.""

Now, Gabrielle, bless her heart, decides to cross the border into Mexico. Rambo tries to warn her that it's the ""most horrible cesspool on Earth,"" but she's like, ""Nah, I've got this."" Nine minutes later, she's kidnapped by a sex-trafficking ring. Yep, that's faster than a cheetah on Red Bull. And guess who's behind it? The fearsome Martinez brothers-Victor and Oscar. These dudes make Hannibal Lecter look like a vegan chef.

Rambo's rage-o-meter hits the roof. He's like, ""I've had it up to here with these Martinez clowns!"" So, he grabs his trusty knife (the one he made for Gabrielle, remember?) and heads south. It's like a twisted episode of ""Dora the Explorer"": ""Can you find the cartel hideout? Say '¬°V√°monos!'""

Now, let's talk action. Rambo's fighting skills are sharper than a pineapple haircut. He takes on the entire cartel with the finesse of a drunken walrus doing ballet. There's blood splattering everywhere-like a Jackson Pollock painting, but with more guts. And the bad guys? They drop like flies. Seriously, Rambo's knife is like Amazon Prime: one-day delivery,

Without giving too much away, let's just say Rambo goes full berserker mode. It's like a pi√±ata party, but instead of candy, he's raining vengeance down on the cartel. And the final showdown? Picture this: Rambo, covered in blood, standing atop a mountain of bad guys, waving a banana like Excalibur. ""This is for Gabrielle!"" he bellows. The Martinez brothers tremble. The audience gasps. And somewhere, a confused chihuahua barks.

""Rambo: Last Blood"" is a rollercoaster ride through a raving chimpanzee's brain. It's bananas, it's bonkers, and it's borderline brilliant. So grab your popcorn, your letter-opener (just in case), and prepare for the most epic showdown since Rocky fought a side of beef. Rambo, you magnificent lunatic, keep slicing and dicing.

Sly doesn't dissapoint. He dispatches bad guys with everything but the kitchen sink. There are some really gruesome bad-guy deaths. Its almost a slasher film in that respect. People get impaled, decapitated, burned and exploded. Good times.

Love love love!!!!!!!,"Grew up as a huge Rambo fan as I love the mind over matter mentality and how he somehow balances PTSD through extreme traumatic experiences and still manages to be a good hearted moral human being. Unbelievably amazing this character of Rambo is that Stallone brought to life with the picture perfect representation of a strong willed soldier- both physically and mentally. The more I think about this movie, the more I adore it because he shows us what many parents- or loving guardians- are capable of if you hurt the babies in the family, no matter how old they are. Love for a child is forever and once again Stallone, Rambo, proves this in his own special mesmerizing way.",10.0,7 November 2019
"A Relentlessly Dark, Tragic Sequel With A Couple Fumbles Here & There","Not a masterpiece, but a surprisingly worthy sequel and one of the year's more underrated films. Extremely dark.

Even more depressing and bleak than the last sequel which is saying a lot since the last one had the bad guys gunning down unarmed children.

Stallone's performance is one of my favorites of the year and the actress playing Gabrielle does a surprisingly heartfelt and emotional job. I felt an almost protective instinct whenever she showed up on screen and you can easily see why Rambo would lose his mind trying to protect her.

Visual direction is pretty solid too. Rambo's world feels grimy but enormous, like he's a perpetual wanderer with no place in the world.

A lot of reviews have compared the violence to a grotesque slasher movie and they'd be right, but it honestly fits this film. It's not like the other sequels where Rambo is on a heroic quest to liberate the oppressed and brig justice; it's a tragedy of a destroyer past his prime lashing out in horrifying vengeance when his world comes crashing down.

The ending feels a bit forced and the film does get overly expository a lot in the first act (and a fair amount of the characters are definitely offensive stereotypes), but it's nowhere near the MAGA nightmare critics made it out to be. If anything, it seems pretty critical and damning of the jingoistic idea that a beefed up American dude with guns can go to another country and fix its corruption. Nobody is saved here by Rambo's actions, (in fact, several innocent people who he was trying to help suffer for them) nobody is redeemed, it's a crushingly hopeless film that's rarely fun but often gripping.",8.0,23 September 2019
"Makes ""Taken"" look like Bambi.",Just a brilliant thoroughly enjoyable good old fashioned popcorn action thriller revenge flick with a heart that is every bit as good as 1 and 4 which are my personal favourites.

"It's Rambo, what did you expect?","I've never left a review on here before but after reading 'First Blood' author David Morrell's criticism, I felt a need to speak up. No spoilers here, FYI.

For those not wanting to read many words: If you like the Rambo films, you'll love this. If you liked Rambo (4, 2008) you'll really love this one. It's a continuation of the story as laid out in its predecessor and does a decent enough job wrapping up the character. Exactly what I expected and did not leave me feeling disappointed.

Could the plot/story have been better? Of course. This is a Rambo movie. You don't watch films like Rambo or Terminator or the such expecting Oscar-winning storytelling. This isn't a Tarantino film. It had enough that made logical sense and was believable and explained why we should care for Rambo.

Violence: in 2008's Rambo, the violence was made a bit more realistic. I'm especially fond of when he jumps into the back of the Jeep and turns the mounted fifty cal down, disintegrating the driver. This movie turns the violence up a bit more, but for the most part it avoids the gore of torture porn films like Saw. The violence wasn't gratuitous-again, you're seeing a Rambo flick so you know there will be ample enough action-and it was only used where it was needed. They didn't just toss extra in ""just because,"" if that makes sense. At times, especially in the third act, it wa so sudden and, well, so violent that it had the audience chuckling. More of a ""holy crap, wow"" chuckle than laughter.

For those who feel there are stereotypes in this film, I feel a need to remind them that this is a Rambo film. Yes, some in the cartel have gold-planted AK47s. Yes, tunnels underground were used at the border. Yes, these are stereotypes of cartels-reinforced by celebrated shows such as Narcos, I might add-but, again, this is a Rambo movie. The bad guys have always been stereotypes throughout the series. Everything from the redneck cops in 'First Blood,' actually. Even the Mujahideen, the brave warriors of Osama Bin Laden who aided Rambo in the third one, were stereotypes. That film's dedication at the end didn't age well, by the way.

Look, if you are easily triggered by light use of stereotypes and violence, don't see this movie. But then you probably shouldn't have seen any and you should avoid films like the Fast and Furious franchise, which is absolutely overflowing with tropes, stereotypes and action.

I loved this film but I know who/what Rambo films are and went into this aware of what to expect.

A great entry into the series and, to be frank, probably the best way to wrap up the franchise without going completely illogical and unrealistic.",8.0,23 September 2019

A different feel to the movie unlike the other movies but just as much gore, action and a lot more booby traps!

A classic revenge plot, Stallone still living up to his iconic role as John Rambo still dealing with his past in a whole new era, and dealing with new social issues.

Movie packs a punch, a homage to the 1980s of Sylvester, but that's what people love.. I liked his subdued approach, age has caught up with the character but just as much bite!

REVENGE AS A VIRTUE,"Obviously this last installment of Rambo is a love letter to all the fans of the previous movies. You got to think about it not like another separete Rambo movie. Think of it like it's the final denaument of a very long movie... the epilogie of a lifetime story of Rambo of Stallone as an action icon. As i can see the ""critics"" are not capable to understand this. So just ignore them.

Full respect for Sylvester Stallone, for his indipendence that he never tended to be someone else, someone that he isn't. Not coloring his hair. Not covering age wrinkles. Always trying to teach us a simple lesson in the movies he scripted. In most of them the lesson is that you've got to fight for the things you want and love, also never give up and always stand up on your feet no matter how hard for you it will be. And damn he looks great and always with incomparable presence. Everytime i see him i got that safety~cosy feeling of comming home for christmas or when put your warm sweather on a very cold day. He's aging the best way a real man should. Looking rough and tough. Got that Cliff where the waves are crashing everlasting look.

In LAST BLOOD we understand that Rambo is not a hero, not an ordinary guy living a sheltered life, but a victim of his own lonelyness, nightmares and oppressed rage. And the only thing that holds this painfull emotinal dam not to crumble is his niece which is almost like daughter to him because he don't have a family. She is now the only chance Rambo can bequeath any moral values or life lessons to somebody. And when the things go wrong we witness what happens when the pain inside is the strongest and most successfull motivator that can unleashes the HELL (in the full meaning of the word) upon the one who attempt to get in his way.

The atmosphere of the movie is like slowly sharpening a knife and cut yourself several times but continue to sharpening it. Sharpening, and sharpening until you begin to want to kill something ...something alive, something with blood and heartbeat... and then suddenly to stab it, stab it, stab STAB, STAB no matter you know that the thing is already dead. And after all this you feel no releif or satisfaction just complete emptiness.

If i got to rank RAMBO: LAST BLOOD like a separete movie i probably give it a 7 out of 10. But it's not just a movie it's a lifetime achievemnet, it is a result to almost 40 + years of hard work and dedication so EXCUSE me so called critics but it's the easiest and best desereved 10 stars i've ever given.",10.0,23 September 2019

The character, Rambo has more dialogue which makes him a more believable in his motives for fighting. The acting by Sly's and his co-stars is superb and bumped-up several notches! Make no mistake about it, this isn't just a carbon-copy of previous Rambo films....it's got HEART!! Pay no attention to critics who were expecting PG-13 violence in a movie about a WAR HERO in the year 2019!!

The film is brutal though. From the violence to the story., it does not shy away from anything and is about as far from feel good as you can imagine.

On the violence front, this film is as stark as I have seen in a long time. A lot of the scenes are stomach turning and reminded me of 70s video nasties at times.

Gory and just how we like Rambo,"Rambo is living a tranquil life on his ranch in Arizona, training horses, doting on his adopted family, Maria (Adriana Barraza) and Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal). He is taking pills to combat PTSD, has an elaborate underground tunnel system, and confesses to Gabrielle that he is trying to keep his inner rage under control. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is living on an Arizona farmstead in retirement, breeding horses and maintaining an underground network of survivalist tunnels. He is close to his Mexican housekeeper Maria (Adriana Barraza) and his orphaned niece Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal). When Gabrielle gets word that her no-account dad is still alive and living in Mexico, she impulsively heads south to find him and winds up being kidnapped as a sex slave by a Mexican cartel. Rambo tools up and saddles up to get her back. Adrian Gr√ºnberg's Rambo: Last Blood brings the series full circle by showing John Rambo (Stallone) living on a ranch, riding horses, and having familial relationships with his niece (Yvette Monreal) and would-be love interest (Adriana Barraza). He seems to have found inner peace at last. Last Blood is a gore-filled slasher movie that follows Rambo's battlefield antics. By the climax, the filmmakers can feel their relief in being able to depict decapitations, severed feet, exploding heads, and at least one makeshift vivisection. The violence in Last Blood is over-the-top and feels like the work of a disaffected adolescent pulling the wings off of flies, making it difficult to laugh. Rambo: Last Blood is a film with extreme violence, shallow characterization, and irresponsible politics. It plays like the dark fantasies of an angry teen. Stallone gives a soulful performance as Rambo, showing a distant glimmer of humanity beneath the combat trauma. He is also menacing, even in his 70s, and I was convinced he could reach into my neck and remove my collarbone. The plot of Rambo is similar to Taken in its setup, its older dad action fantasy, and its cultural insensitivity. When the protagonist goes to Mexico to find her estranged father, she is kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery by two cartoonishly evil Mexican crime lords. It is up to Rambo to rescue her, but he runs afoul of them and begins a rivalry. Paz Vega has a small role as a deliverer of exposition. The filmmakers have made Mexico seem like an endless wasteland of crime and death, with Latinx characters portrayed as criminals or stereotypes. This is offensive and dated, and irresponsible in 2019.",10.0,20 April 2023

Must Watch : Last chance to see the iconic Rambo on film,"Review RamBo Last Blood

This is the 5th arc of Rambo francised movies and it's 11 years since Rambo4 on the theatre. The movie has 1h30Mins lenght which was taken the first 1 hour to drama. I think it makes sense becoz we dont know how Rambo live during 11 years. Rambo still haunted from Vietnam war . There are few characters on Rambo Last blood. Rambo wants to live in peace at his old age. Sly still did awesome to story with logic. I think it makes sense why Rambo has to be killer machine again. In the last 30 mins , we see killing as Rambo style. Most weapons made by Rambo himself. Extreme violence scenes , shot in the head, villain has his leg cut off, Sly got knife wounds on his face. Sly takes villain's heart out of his body whole he lives.

Drama scene , Sly did great. I almost cried when his niece died and Sly presented his feeling of losting. He cannot save anyone. Every people that he love already gone.

It may be the last but it's got that RAMBO guts we all know and love.,"Terrific conclusion to the Rambo movie saga.

We all know the book is completely different to the Sylvestor filmed version but that's because Sylvestor was trying to highlight the wrong that was done to the soldiers who were in pointless wars like Vietnam.

Simply a person who wants to fit in with socitety but is such an amazing soldier, they no longer know how.

This final chapter in the beloved Rambo saga is simply stunning. Rambo is now an old man, but that doesn't mean he's forgotten all the training the years have put him through.

It's both tragic and poetic. Terrific story telling in a way only Sylvestor seems capable of conveying and sincerely he does incredible justice to our much loved tortured character.

No matter which version you prefer, Book or movie, Rambo is without doubt a tortured character. So this seriously sad and tragic ending is worthy of being owned by a superb character like the Rambo Sylvestor shows us with the high impact movies.

All the movies showed were how an ex Vietnam vet simply wanted to gel back into society, but sadly society has failed him WAY to many levels and this tragic but ever so worthy conclusion highlights yet another issue with our very sad societal system.

So many thanks to Slyvestor for this amazing movie. As a fan I loved it. Found it worthy of the Rambo legacy and a fitting conclusion. I guess with Rambo there could be no happy ending but in a way he ends the legacy in a way that fans will both cheer and cry for the loss of our great hero who will never be forgotten.

Director Adrian Grunberg is clearly stepping into the limelight following this film!,"You've got to give it to Adrian Grunberg. After clearly being given a half assed script, terrible dialogue, and a touch of the Prima Donna that is Stallone; he's still managed to thread it all together into an absolutely cracking film. To listen to the audience, cringing, wooping, laughing, covering their eyes as bones are cracked, through to being overcome by uncontrollable action movie nostalgia is something I've not been a witness to in a movie theater for a long long time! I think it really helped that expectations were low from the audience at the outset to the film. I mean that really is the way to get at an an audience, take them unawares, play with their emotions and methodically mould those emotional highs and lows into a cinematic journey. It is a skill and Adrian's clearly mastered it. It was truly effortless cinematography from start to an incredible finish.

I can't wait for Adrian's next film... maybe he should hold off hitting up Arnold just quite yet... He could instead get on with stepping up to actually taking full control directing an episode in the next Narcos Mexico series??? He would smash it! Well done Adrian!",9.0,18 October 2019

The war ain't over till Rambo says it's over.,"I really liked the last Rambo film which came in 2008 and really felt it was the end of an era, but Sylvester Stallone felt there was one more story to tell.



I rather not go to deep in the story, because I don't feel like giving away any spoilers. All just say it's everything you would expect in a Rambo movie. Stallone does gives more to the character Rambo this time, his performance is enjoyable to watch. And the bad guys here are about what to expect, to the point you'll be waiting when Rambo is gonna go at it with them. Is it has good as Rambo(2008), no. But still entertaining nothing more.

Ignore the Critics,"Critics view point is some what askew from what the rest of us watch and as such can miss lead. Rambo first blood was an excellent book by David Morrel followed by an equally great movie. Last Blood represents the real final chapter and it delivers massivly.

The storyline is straight forward but Stallone dons his Rambo persona like an old Lion looking for his last kill. This action revenge thriller gives a satifying end to a saga that started 40 years ago.

Plot is very predictable and thin. But a nice film.,"After watching this film I watch the earlier Rambo movies and I'd say that the plot is very predictable and short. It's even shorter than all the other kidnapping, slave trading films. We all know how Rambo films are. First encounter, get captured. Then revenge. That's all but shorter in this film. In the earlier Rambo films, the revenge and the success of the mission had some suspense. But the audience can see the ending of the film buy the first 20 or 30 mins in to the film.

But overall I enjoyed the film and gave me an insight to the character , Rambo which inspired me to watch the rest of the films. I'd say the first film so far is the best",8.0,12 December 2019

Hail Stallone!,"The last movie of the iconic series portrays the retirement days of Rambo. He lives a quiet life in Arizona with his niece Gabriela and her grandmother. In this movie, the character development of Rambo is the best among all five movies. He is slightly more talkative, trying to take pleasure from the rest of his life. He tries to forget his previous life in which he did horrible things but those memories keep haunting him from time to time. His emotional attachment to Gabriela is very nicely depicted. She becomes the only reason for Rambo to live. Hence the plot is compelling.

One day, Gabriela goes to Mexico to visit her father who abandoned her years ago. Then, she finds herself abducted by a local cartel. Rambo sets off for Mexico to find her. Here, the movie contains traces of Unforgiven (1992) which I like a lot. Rambo takes a hell of a revenge. The ending is spectacular.",8.0,11 January 2022

Angry Stallone remains a joy to watch,"John Rambo has been to hell and back many times. There's nothing he hasn't seen, and nothing he can unsee. He's haunted by the past, by the torture, by the bloodshed. Now, 10 years on from his last battle, he is settled down in a quiet location with people he's come to care for, or, as Rambo puts it: a family he didn't think he'd ever have. Things change when his old friend's granddaughter wants to find her father down in Mexico; a search that has dreadful consequences, pushing John Rambo once again into a world of hurt.

The story is serviceable - giving Rambo more words than usual - and Stallone capably handles the material. Predictably, he is also the only character really worth rooting for; none of the characters are necessarily bad, but the film's lean runtime doesn't really flesh supporting characters out as much as it could. But that's fine. Because fans want to see Stallone in revenge mode, and it isn't long before his weapons come out to play and the blood is spilled.

Witnessing an angry Sylvester Stallone remains a joy to watch, and the resulting rampage is brutally satisfying as per series standards. Just like the title character, its easy to take sadistic pleasure in watching many horrible people meet a grim demise, and violence is never less than graphic. But bloodshed is what Rambo: Last Blood is all about, and as the central character is taken back to his inventive trap-killing roots, its hard to keep a smile off your face seeing Stallone create carnage one last time.

"Great, Stallone still doing action and doing it well","In comparison with the last movie Rambo(the 4th film in the series), I thought that was hard to beat. Even so, Last Blood may not be as great as the last movie, it still is very good and I enjoyed it a lot. Taking the original plot from what was going to be the last Rambo film, where John is living back at home trying to live a peaceful life, but family matters bring him back to his violent nature. This time however, it is personal and Stallone goes Bronson style in taking down human traffickers in this grim tale of revenge. Before he turns back into the killing machine we all know and love, this shows a more human side to the man until darkness descends and he comfortably goes back to the violent world he knows best. This has the most in common with 70's and early 80's post Deathwish movies, but in a modern time and a bigger budget. I am reminded a lot of Rolling Thunder, which is still quite different than this and actually predates the original First Blood movie by several years. Rambo takes out these scumbags in a variety of different ways and is quite savage. In the brutal finale he uses his military training and experiences in Vietnam to dispatch his foes with what looks like relative ease. As a fan of the series Sly did not let me down and he is in better shape as senior citizen then lots of people(athletes even) that are half his age.",9.0,28 December 2019

"I expected a cheap sequel, but I got a blistering, bleak, true to life ripping action drama. One of Stallone's best acting performances. NOT suited though for old Rambo fans.","I never expected such a serious, bleak, hard hitting action DRAMA. I would not recommend it though to the older Rambo fans, because 75% of the movie is serious DRAMA about human trafficking of girls in Mexico. Not action, but serious DRAMA is what the start of this movie is about. I guess lots of (Rambo) action fans wont like that. I did like it though, because the drama was seriously real and touching.

The story: Rambo's niece gets kidnapped in Mexico and is forced into prostitution. Rambo is gonna save her. Will he succeed? May sound like a cheap B-movie story, but hold your horses, the execution of this story is TRUE TO LIFE (up to a point..., because there is still enough blistering straight over the top violence)

The good: serious acting performances by all actors involved. This is (fortunately) NOT SOLELY a dumb witted action movie, but it has a true to life dramatic story at it's heart AS WELL. Impressive. Stallone CAN act! I knew that already, but this movie shows it AGAIN.

The bad: it's a bit low in suspense at the beginning. Minor complaint though, because there is more HIDEOUS violence, compared to former Rambo editions. The violence is really gruesome at moments. Not sure if I liked that, but it was impressive nonetheless, sort of...

Sylvester Stallone is still the man! He looked tough, but he simultaneously succeeded in making a great (last) true to life, ORIGINAL and DRAMATIC sequel!

You can feel the rage the man suffers and would like to join him if You could at any second.

I have nothing against Mexico but it has anarchy in most of the country, especially places close to the border. Smugglers and dealers can only be answered forcibly because there is no negotiation, the innocent are mostly harmed, and young people in Mexico have very limited options. In Mexico and the USA, much more violent things happen on the street than what was seen in the movie. It's a part of everyday life that some critics and directors don't seem to understand or see. I tell them to take a walk through Mexico and some more dangerous neighborhoods and experience something with their eyes. a fantastic movie depicting cruel reality.",10.0,15 February 2020

Vengeance of Rambo,"To be honest I thought this film was going to be a disappointment, but actually I enjoyed it. There was too much gore for my liking.

Unlike his other films this story had purpose and it was serious. A man taken over the edge, unlike the first film where he never killed anyone. In this one it's totally opposite.

Get Rambo, John Wick and Riley North in a room together they could be a impossible force. They are all very tactical in their methods.

So for Last Blood, this could be his last? Never say never. Mmm didn't Riley North take on a whole cartel as well?",9.0,15 January 2020
"What a disgrace for the final film of the franchise. I expected so, so, much more.","This movie had so many flaws and had totally re-arranged the whole story of John Rambo. Major plot holes all over that contradicts the whole Rambo Franchise. To me, I had to pretend that this film doesn't even exist because it totally defeats the whole premise of the Rambo films. Here are just a few major flaws that has no concept of the story of John Rambo: Rambo was a lone wolf, with no family, no friends, just a survivor of war, and knows no other way of life and is scarred mentally. So, they suddenly decide that he has family? Why change the whole plot when that's not even the story of Rambo? Ok, another major flaw is, Rambo would never set himself up to get killed and walk right into that confrontation where, in reality , he would of been killed just like that. Again, that's not Rambo. Rambo has a plan, that won't fail, and would never be foolish enough to just walk into a possible trap. They needed to eliminate the family that he never had, simply because he never had any family - that's Rambo. My writing for this film would involve Rambo hiding out off of the grid and hiding from enemies off war that were hunting him, and he ends up meeting up with a buddy from war whom he thought was dead after all of these years and they both team up for a one final battle of last blood for the finale of the franchise.

That's what I would of done. They ruined and disgraced the franchise with this false representation of Rambo.",8.0,18 April 2021
Excellent movie,"Not such a big fan of extreme bloody scenes.

Old school movies for hard tough men!",10.0,2 January 2020
One of the best action films of the decade and a fitting continuation of the Rambo series.,"The Rambo films are unique in that they exist on their own in the action genre. The character of Rambo develops with each movie and it is refreshingly free of any traces of postmodern glibness or self-consciousness.

The latest film takes the idea of Rambo as a moral avenger and defender of women and runs hard with it. The acting is superb throughout. Stallone keeps getting better in films and his ability to hold the screen even while he isn't saying anything is used well here.

The direction is tense, muscular and doesn't succumb to modern cinema's problem of overediting action scenes. The cinematography is the best of the whole series and they should keep the same cinematographer if they do another one.

The one problem with the film is the over the top finale. Rambo has essentially been a mythical figure since the second film and he is much better when shown pulling off feats of endurance, strength and survival than emulating Jason Voorhees from Friday The 13th. The graphic nature of the finale is the film's only major misstep. Next time give him a villian or villains who are clearly superior to him and it's only through his resolve and willpower that he wins.

I'm looking forward to another one as soon as possible.",8.0,2 October 2019

It would be awesome to have a hero come along to say enough of this!. So my emotions really got envolved with this latest telling of Rambo. I cried in the middle and I felt Stallone's performance was Oscar level. My dad's a Vietnam vet and I seen this performance as true as it can be.

A magnificent last Rambo,"Rambo: Last Blood - directed by ""Adrian Gr√ºnberg"" will certainly be the last part of this wonderful saga ""RAMBO"" started in 1982 hey yes, time passes but our hero Sylvestre Stallone was great in this new opus. Being an unconditional fan of Sly for a long time, I still appreciated to see him perform this marvelous role that sticks to his skin so well because this monster cinema always incredible physics despite passing years, it fills with emotion every character that he embodies, and here he still brings his unique touch that impregnated his unique character, if there had been no Stallone, there would never have been a real Rambo, a incredible charisma and a unique physical presence, which made this man a true hero of the seventh art.",10.0,7 December 2019
Great Movie,"I love movies with realistic violence. Script, Actor/Actress and Graphics all put together a movie (and many other things). There are some outstanding movies out now that don't spend the money to make a gun blast to the gut or a heavy landing punch to the face realistic. Those movies suck and I likely will only watch them once.

The fighting, shooting, and blasts were incredibly realistic in this movie. I'd watch this repeatedly. Great storyline, powerful character arcs, strong plot, emotional twists, and many other things. This is definitely in my favorite's list.",10.0,2 May 2020

Is the movie good ?

Have you watched the stream of illegals entering in broad daylight since our current illegitimate president took office? No? Well, maybe you should try and accept reality. The border is far more porous than the film suggests. Never the less, the film is brilliant. I just love it when a movie star decides to buck Hollyweirds elite and provoke those of you on the left who seem only capable of hating your own nation. Watch it, accept the reality of the despotic nation south of our border, truly a nation of crime ruled by drug cartels and well, cowards if we're to accept the facts. I'd give it 15 stars if I could.

Brilliant. IMDb needs to eradicate the quac,"It's a great film. So don't think you need to ask a quack. But for some reason, this film only says 6+. Now I know the last 50 reviews say 10 or 8, so why such a low score. 2 things. The 1st are quacks, who have absolutely no connection with reality, who give it 1 or 2. Most if not all of these quacks are people with an agenda that's has nothing to do with the quality of a film. They just like to be different. They are usually people who like to be noticed, they want people to see them. Well, ok, now we have done with this, what about the 2nd reason. Well, con Tarley, or contrary, to popular belief, many commentators state that there is a conspiracy, involving voting. I don't believe this, it's not true...I believe it has more to do with the algorithm, and it's method. If they take the mean average, then all it takes is a quack, to completely undo, the honest vote of 10 people. If they use the median, then, it can be worse. So the answer to this chaotic mathematical rule is simple. It's broken. We allow some mind befuddled idiot, who has a secret personal agenda, to falsely rate a film, giving adverse advice, against 10 others, and they are allowed to get away with it. So what do we do.. you can't fix a broken system, until the administrators change the algorithm. In the mean time, or median time, just accept that 10% of voters are quacks. Exactly the same way that the legal system with a jury, needs to take this into account. That's why a hung jury requires 2 out of the 10. The 1 is acceptable for a conviction or an acquittal.

Yes the Mexicans in the movie are devilish, to some, such cruelty shown in the movie does not really exist, so showing it is racism against Mexicans in general, but sadly such cruelty does exist, and is even worst, in Mexico and other places around the world where crime prospers. So maybe its too explicit, but it's based on reality, for some critics this reality is maybe too much to accept. There is no racism in the movie, just very bad criminals who are doing horrible things to innocent people, and there is Rambo. Anyways, great performance of Stallone, who gives all he has, some parts in the movie were unexpected at least for me, and hard to watch, so beware this is not the typical action movie although the plot is simple, and you know how it will end more or less. The violence and tension is built slowly but in a growing scale until the climax, you will get stuck to chair the entire movie I promise. Sadly, they don't make such movies anymore, today most action movies try to bring something new, add plot twists, and entertain, Rambo does not entertain, he bring strict pure primal violence, without excuses, second thoughts, or regrets. There is good and there is evil, and they will clash, and Rambo will to his best to make thing right the only way he knows, the only way he does best, as you may already imagine. Must watch!",10.0,26 November 2019

But no matter what he has been through, he just stands there and tells you that life is worthy of respect and man's dignity is priceless.

Stallone made a lot of films, in recent years to shoot the kamikaze is also very wonderful, but the favorite, is always the first drop of blood series, because rocky diaosi counterattack, special police judge high, only rambo, not victory and defeat, some is only pain, the pain of the country, but also the enemy. Rambo skill, killing, but no one more than he hated the war. In the first one, watching him cry and saying to the colonel, ""I saw my comrades blown to pieces,"" he said, ""John, take me home. I said yes, but where's your leg?"" Rambo is pain in my heart, also is calm, he saw the world of cruel, passed to see all the evil, but is such a man, a real man, with his own body tells us, no matter what experience, he is he, rambo is rambo, do not speak truth, also won't go to emotional, never be overwhelmed by evil, also is not afraid of suffering of life, for him, seriously alive, ratio what all important.

Like a very adult version of 'Home Alone',"I was a little bit worried about 'Rambo: Last Blood' at the start. The opening scene was very uninspiring (and felt extremely tacked on to the rest of the film) and then 'Rambo' without long hair really threw me. It just didn't feel like 'Rambo'. The film then patiently set up its story and introduced us to some new characters. And then the film just exploded and became everything I wanted and more.

The levels of violence in this movie are insane. Like even 2019 insane. I loved it. That's what I want to see from a 'Rambo' movie, is absolutely nothing held back. I don't know what the body count for this movie was but it must be incredibly high. Also all the villains are set up really well. We are made to truly hate them, which makes it so much better when 'Rambo' starts doing his thing. The final 20 minutes or so of this movie are incredible. It's a quite amazing action sequence that has to be seen to be believed.

The amount of people sent to kill one man is kind of ridiculous. Like imagine if they just got there and instantly shot him on his porch. About 150 people would be kind of annoyed they made the trip. Also (and this is nothing new but it is still a problem) you almost need subtitles for 'Rambo' in some scenes. It can be pretty hard to pick up exactly what he's saying. Otherwise though I had a great time with 'Rambo: Last Blood'. It may not be for the faint-hearted, but if some violence doesn't bother you then you're in for a treat.",8.0,2 December 2019

Sylvester Stallone gives a powerful and nuanced performance as the aging warrior who must face his past and unleash his fury one last time. The film is a thrilling and emotional ride that pays homage to the classic Rambo films while also exploring new themes of family, redemption and justice. The action scenes are spectacular and brutal, showcasing Rambo's skills and ingenuity in the face of overwhelming odds. The film also features a strong supporting cast, including Paz Vega as a journalist who helps Rambo, Sergio Peris-Mencheta as the ruthless cartel leader, and Yvette Monreal as Rambo's niece who is kidnapped by the villains.

Critics Are Not Worth Listening To On This One,"The review I read beforehand attempted to intimate that this was a MAGA film, and because the villains are Mexican.

The movie that came to mind while watching this was ""Commando"": a man seeks revenge on the criminals who have messed with him and kidnapped his little girl. The outline is similar and the action over the top and the villains are cartoons.

It's not deep, it's fun. Anyone who loves action movies of the 1980s ilk will realize this film is as much a paean to those movies as it is the final Rambo.

The only negative is the digital effects sometimes looked rushed and cheap, but overall there's buckets of gorey action and a fitting conclusion to a simple story.

Revenge Gets Better!,"Rambo: Last Blood is a bloody and gore revenge movie with a great action pack scenes.

The story is all about the teenage girl named ""Gabriela"" who got killed and abuse by the martinez brothers along with their henchmen. Rambo on the other hand, does not let her go, finds her until rambo encounters the martinez brothers and he got surrounded by a dozen henchmen.

Rambo got beaten and when be recovers back, he got a hammer and smash those bad guys out there until she finds Gabriela. Rambo saves her and while the two on the road, Gabriela passed away.

Rambo takes revenge by making his dangerous traps that would kill the enemies. He finds victor martinez the brother of hugo, killed him in a way of beheading.

The final scene of the movie is really my favorite scene, it was action pack and full of bloody killing scenes. The traps were awesome and every henchmen steps forward it captures them and got killed.

Rambo killed hugo by bow shoot attack and ripping his heart with his knife.

Not surprisingly, this doesn't go very well, and Rambo must once again return to his former self.

Time to retire,,,3 February 2024
where's Rambo?,"Rambo is a franchise I wrote off a long time ago. Thinking that it was a ridiculous action franchise that held nothing for me. I recently checked out First Blood, the first in the franchise, in preparation for this film and certainly enjoyed the movie. I went and saw this ""finale"" with my father, as the first time I saw the movies was with him. I enjoy Stallone as an actor and action hero and looked forward to this instalment. So, let's see how it is... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- POSITIVES! Elements of Rambo, in his old age, are very interesting. His living environments, his prescribed medication, and his enduring trauma are all strong assets that could've been better displayed in this ""ending"". Stallone is an awesome actor in certain roles. Whilst this isn't the actors best outing as the character, his figure and imposing impression is extremely effective and terrifying. The depiction of the antagonists, although not the best villains ever, were showcased in a method that made them horrendous and formulating audiences to anticipate their demise. There is some awesomely executed action in the second and third acts. Incredibly gruesome and entertaining for those action movie fans. There is some great sound design in those sequences, along with some decent makeup demonstrated. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MIXED! Whilst the film has that enjoyable revenge-driven action movie plot, the shift in tone and story direction don't make this feel like a Rambo movie, certainly not a finale. There are elements of that character and franchise touched upon in this instalment, but it wasn't as strong as previously established. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NEGATIVES! This script is both rushed and dragged out. With weak dialogue and supporting characters. The film rushes through the opening act, but then takes it's time to get to the action in the following acts. There are some impressive practical effects here and there, but the CGI could be a bit jarring. And lastly, this may seem like a ridiculous negative, but the lack of the long hair and headband was hilariously disappointing. It also adds to that idea of not feeling like a Rambo movie. Another element that adds fuel to that fire is the change in location. When I, and hardcore Rambo fans, think of the character, we think of Rambo in a nature/forest environment. Whilst these locations are very well constructed, it doesn't feel like a Rambo setting. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In the end, Rambo: Last Blood wasn't a strong conclusion, if it was one. The script was hurried and didn't feel like a conclusion to the character in question and didn't feel like the character. It's a script that feels derivative from other action movies with the character of Rambo in the title. It has some impressively implemented action sequences with a lot of gruesome kills, if that's what you want. Although it had some Western traits, I would've preferred a movie along the lines of Unforgiven or Logan where it was more of a stronger character study with action components.",,25 September 2019
