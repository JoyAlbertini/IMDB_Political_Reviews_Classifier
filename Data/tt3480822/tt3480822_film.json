    "reviewBody": "Black Widow ( Scarlett Johansson) must deal with a villain from her past and her long-absent family.\n\nLOUD, confusing and far too long. It starts off OK but quickly falls apart and becomes confusing and convoluted. The film is also way too long--it doesn&apos;t need to run over 2 hours. There&apos;s also tons of CGI at the end--way too much. The acting is OK. In short a long forgettable MCU movie.",
