Horribly Misjudged,"Having always heard terrible things about it, I had avoided Hulk (2003) as I felt I had better things to watch. Upon viewing, in the current day of superhero films, I am surprised to say how much fun this was! The acting is a little cheesy, the dialogue is a bit hokey, and the effects look cartoonish at parts, but that all comes together to make you feel like you are watching a comic book brought to life. Going as far as making scene transitions mimic the pages of a comic, the uniqueness of this movie create quite an enjoyable viewing experience. I also feel that this did the best job of portraying the lonely monster side of Hulk, instead of theGod battling brute we normally see. Ang Lee's vision of the Green Goliath is a love letter to the medium that inspired the film.",7.0,11 October 2023
"Initially Dismissed Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" Deserves Another Appraisal","Smashing His Way into the First Wave of Marvel Movie Superheroes, (The Incredible) Hulk, an at First Failed Title that only went 6 Issues in the Early Sixties, did Recover and has had a Long and Intricate Career (Grey/Green). The 1970's TV Show with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno is Remembered Fondly.

Director Ang Lee Decided to give the Tragic and Unfortunate Scientist Bruce Banner and His Gamma Ray Created ""Monster"" a more than Serious, Psychological, Philosophical Bent that Audiences found Boring, Slow, and Pounded on this Film with some Brutal Bashing and the Sequel was Scrapped.

Critics, for the most part, Like the Movie Much More than Mainstream Viewers. They were Kind to the Depth of Characters and Rich Story. The Movie's Supreme and Interesting Template also got Noticed.

Back to the Haters. Folks Complained about the Length (2hr 20min), Nick Nolte's Bombastic, Shouting Performance, and Not Enough ""Hulk"". The Big Green Guy doesn't Show Up much in the First Hour.

Danny Elfman's Score is as Usual, Good but Derivative and Repetitive. The Characters like Betty (Jennifer Connelly), General Ross (Sam Elliott), and Talbot (Josh Lucas) are 100% Dead Serious and Chew the Melodramatics Ad Nauseum.

Overall, Director Ang Lee Accomplished His Vision, but in the Early Days of the Mega-Blockbuster Summer Superhero Movie, it wasn't Welcomed and was Dismissed as a Major Misfire. Viewed Today it Holds Up quite well and Deserves a ""New"" Look and Appraisal.",7.0,21 September 2017
Ahead of its time - Good back story,"If you saw this when it first came out, you would probably have hated the split screen cut away's etc The story seemed complicated at the time and it was the first re-enactment since the TV series so a lot of the audience had a sentimental attachment to Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno. I've watched this on TV over the years and for some reason I am strongly drawn to it. I just think its underrated. Watching it now 21st May 2016 I think it does fit in with the Marvel Universe and offers a good backstory especially of his love for Betty Ross. The affects are not totally bad as when you watch you become more enthralled with the story. I am still not a fan of the split screen/24 dual story imaging but otherwise I think it is an underrated film. I'm neither DC or Marvel i'm more the action hero and for me it was always Superman and Spiderman /Incredible Hulk as the also rans. Superman was just the hero. As a kid growing up nothing more i'd love to do sometimes would be wear a shirt id grown out of and try and do muscular stretches at 10 and burst that old school shirt. This film has grown on me now i'm 43 and while I did n't like it at the time its grown on me the more I've seen it over the years on TV. Superman Returns V Hulk then this wins as Superman Returns was such a missed opportunity. Casting is great Bana,Elliot,Connelly and even Nolte buying into comic book Folk Lore for the time. When I first watched Hulk id have given it a 5.5 i'd now have to say its worth a 7. The special effects are not bad still - ie they draw you in and you don';t question the rendering like some tech head. The story seems easier to understand and HULK as a character fits in with the current Avengers Marvel Universe. Overall it's a film thats aged well and should be up-rated rather than under rated.",7.0,21 May 2016
Interesting attempt,"Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a brilliant scientist working with his girlfriend Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) on nanomeds and gamma radiation to cure physical ailments. A lab accident causes high exposure of gamma radiation and releases the hulk within him. His father David (Nick Nolte) had experimented on himself and transferred some changes within Bruce. When Bruce was 4, an incident which he can't remember caused Betty's father Gen Ross (Sam Elliott) to lock up David Banner. Now David is back just in time to see the change in Bruce release by the gamma radiation.

Director Ang Lee definitely put his own mark on this comic book movie. It's probably not what the fans or Marvel was looking for. This is a much more a Greek tragedy than a popcorn summer action flick. While it's the not the best choice, it does make it an uniquely interesting comic book movie.

The acting from Eric Bana is a little too bland. He's not really a favorite of mine. On the other hand, Jennifer Connelly is superb. She is the heart and soul of this movie. Nick Nolte shows that he can play crazy well. He definitely goes overboard but I sorta like it. Sam Elliott tries a little too hard. He should be able to play this part without trying. He doesn't need to yell and scream.

Then there is all the split screen and other visual tricks. Ang Lee is pulling inspiration from the comic books. However he may be too literal and more importantly overused this style. Luckily, it does make it more visually interesting when the story moves at a slower pace. There is something outside the normal comic book movie going on here. It is fascinating. It doesn't work that well. But it's good enough for me to recommend. It's worthwhile to check out at least once.",6.0,26 April 2014
A Dark Human Drama Masquerading as a Comic Book Film,"Ang Lee's 'Hulk' has always received a bad reputation and twelve years on, its critical reception is not likely to change. Despite being superior to the 2008 reboot, it has not been given the recognition that it deserves.

Bruce Banner works as a scientist with his ex-girlfriend. They are trying to achieve cell repair in animals, but to no avail. One day, Bruce is exposed to gamma radiation when a machine malfunctions; mysteriously he survives the incident. Only to discover that he changes into a ranging green monster, whenever he experiences high levels of stress.

Eric Bana as Bruce Banner does a serviceable job, you buy into his character, but Bana lacks the required enthusiasm on screen. He appears as a blank slate and you just wish that he would provide more emotion when it really matters. The tormented character is the driving force in the film and sadly Bana offers little extra. Jennifer Connelly as ex-girlfriend Betty Ross is more commendable, bringing tenderness to the role and thereby selling her affection for Banner in the process. Nick Nolte as Bruce's estranged father is a scientist gone mad from his past failures. You never can tell what he is capable of doing on-screen. The times we do spend with Nolte are indeed the most compelling segments of the film.

'Hulk' is still sure to split the opinions of audiences in half. What some may consider being an interesting take on the tragic hero, full of emotion and character depth, others will be overwhelmed by its admittedly self-indulgent length (at 138 minutes) and disappointed with a lack of scenes that consist of Hulk smashing up anything that he comes into contact with. Unfortunately, the CGI can create a jarring experience, from the effects looking solid to poorly animated.

'Hulk' does indeed benefit though, with a smartly written screenplay by James Schamus. This is a more thoughtful and nuanced approach to a hero that many will not be expecting. It is concerned with the psychological aspects of Bruce Banner and how his relationships with his father and his ex-girlfriend shape him. If you are comfortable with the story taking its time to set up characters and plot points, darker than your average super hero flick, then you are bound to enjoy watching 'Hulk'. If not, then I would re consider whether watching this film is worth your time.

'Hulk' is certainly better than its reputation would suggest. Ang Lee finds a way to make us care about a character that is essentially a giant green monster filled with rage. A sharp script helps to engage the audience, even if the running time is patience testing at best. For those that can appreciate what 'Hulk' does eloquently with its ambitious story and artistic sensibilities then they are sure to have a rewarding and satisfying experience that is among the best that Marvel has to offer in the early 2000s.",7.0,27 September 2015
Very impressive!,"I finally caught up with the film on DVD, after missing its cinema release and just not having the urge to see it until now. It has had some rather bad press, so I wasn't actually expecting very much.

One of the reasons I have waited so long was to let my son, (who is now eight) grow up a bit before seeing it. He was interested in the tie-in products filling the shelves in all the stores on release. A blanket-marketing ploy that is becoming more and more hysterical, I fear.

Another was that I was wary of renting it as the Hulk character has been rather mal-treated in live-action form.

Until Ang Lee's film.

Firstly, this isn't by any stretch of the imagination, a kids' film. Though my younger children watched it, it gave them serious food for thought about what scientists do to animals and people in the name of science. My oldest was enthralled. She appreciated Lee's magnificent use of the film medium.

This is a very dark movie. The origin-story has been manipulated and updated linking the two lead characters (Bana and Connelly) in a sorrowful, fearful event that happened to them both in their childhood. Nice touch.

""Banner's"" (Eric Bana's) father (played by Nick Nolte) shuffles back into his life after 30 years incarceration for causing the events that had traumatized the young Banner. Banner later finds that his father had ""experimented"" on him when they were still a whole family. This creepy device effectively modernizes the story and it's ultimate revelation is a clever way of releasing the pent-up rage that Banner jr has locked within his mind. This rage feeds the Hulk. Banner finally becomes the Hulk after some incredible bravery in the lab.

The film's effects are superb. I am a very happy viewer. This is great cinema. A wonderful adaptation of a tortured, misunderstood human being.

Highly recommended, by me, for true Hulk fans.",,22 November 2004
Absolutely Boring,,1.0,5 September 2005
Interesting and different superhero adaptation,"Hulk is an excellent action/drama and science-fiction film based on the classic superhero (or antihero) The Incredible Hulk. Following the trend on the last years about recycling comic superheroes, Hulk's turn became a very interesting alternative to other formulas used in several of these adaptations.

Knowing that many people consider this movie as dull and boring, please let me state that it's far from being dull. After the critics towards Spiderman just scratching the surface of character development, and where other movies simply failed miserably (e.g. Daredevil), we should be grateful that we can finally see some depth in the main character as we're used in the good comics.

Ang Lee's direction shows his usual way of telling stories, in a sensitive and personal way. Instead of letting the movie drown in its limitless action possibilities, he conducted the story through a sensible path. The editing work, which remarkably resembles comic frames in many scenes, and contains some awesome transitions, is simply wonderful.

And all this not forgetting Hulk's main point: a green, angry mass of power and destruction. The movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen lately, which makes me wonder what is expecting some people who blame this movie for its lack of massive fights against entire armies. My opinion is that the action scenes of Hulk are perfectly balanced; more than showing Hulk's sheer strength but never going completely overboard. And also showing some of Hulk's main weaknesses, keeping the character real and not entering the area of fantasy.

One side of this movie that people also seems to throw tantrums about, is the refurbishing of Hulk's origins. The story of Bruce Banner's transformation has been updated with including today's technology, and making it in my humble opinion much more interesting and 'believable' than the original. Not being a huge fan of Hulk's comics, I didn't feel personally attached to the original story, so I actually liked it more. But I can understand that the purists or the die-hard fans will be disappointed by these changes.

Along with Hulk's origins, the plot includes good science-fiction elements. Don't misunderstand me; the stuff is in general barely believable. A scientist conducting advanced genetic experiments in 1965 (all by himself!) is not a good start... But in the end, it doesn't matter. This superhero adaptation is as good science-fiction as other excellent adaptations like X-Men (including its sequel X2), where others will just remain as good or bad action films with just some sci-fi scattered around. Where others lost their opportunity, Hulk didn't.

What other things are good in this movie? Well, the main actors all do a good work, specially Jennifer Conelly and Nick Nolte. The special effects are great, and while there are entire scenes made just of CGI, they're still not the strong point of the movie. The plot and dialogues aren't just bridges between computer generated action scenes, which I'm thankful for. Furthermore, the plot is also rich in references to the comic, Hulk's enemies and other subtle things. The movie is full of small details (has anyone noticed the frog over the hat in the final scene?) which reward you when watching it a second or third time.

The main down of the movie might be that followers aren't used to see Hulk in this way, a deep and sensitive character, and probably expected more action and enemy-smashing and less deep dialogues running after child traumas... Which could explain its relatively low rating and some bad critics. Maybe I just connected very well with this movie and that's why I put it so well, but I can also see that the elements of this film, taken independently, also have their merits and all together form a solid production. In my opinion, of all the comic superhero adaptations, Hulk is the most interesting and best quality one which I've watched to date. I just wish people would concentrate more on enjoying this different view of a superhero's life. But oh well, each one has different tastes.

And one final note. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful!",7.0,25 June 2005
Call it Angry Shrek...,,2.0,8 July 2003
The best modern Hulk movie,"Ang Lee is a great director. And great directors make great movies. In this case we have an extraordinary film that develops characters, adds intensity to the plot, explains everything we see in a satisfactory way, has great actors and dares to use the aesthetics of the comic to make us enjoy the experience. Maybe the villain could have been better but in a sense it is more of an inner journey of the protagonist (he has problems with his father, problems with his girlfriend, problems with a potential father-in-law, problems with a sentimental competitor) but in any case he does not stop have courage. It is a good movie and unfortunately Marvel has not dared to make good cinema with its characters by inviting renowned directors. It is a pity.",7.0,22 October 2021
Skip It!,,1.0,16 June 2003
"Way, way better than the 2008 reboot","The direction is so good, the acting is best quality, the story is well told. It's a terrific blend of action movie and comic book story. It's full of heart, and depth. The Hulk's story is a good one. It deserves as reverent a telling as, for example, the Batman story, and it gets it here. I really enjoy the old-timey feeling - it's told in contemporary times, but with a retro, 1950s nuclear-age feel. Nick Nolte is wonderful, as always. It might not have been a boon to Eric Bana, because the movie didn't do so well, but he was really quite good in the role. Everybody played it straight, no arch acting, which is due to the Ang Lee's direction. Think about it, the actors in the various key roles have played these roles before (and since), but in this movie, there's no hammy acting - these associations are there, but, as I said, played straight. It's fascinating and wonderful to see. Sam Elliot is the gruff military guy, but is human. Nick Nolte is the loony, but human. Eric Bana is full of quiet strength as Bruce Banner, and wild strength (and freedom) as Hulk but *human*. It's not a formula action hero/superhuman movie at all, it's art. Underrated art.",9.0,3 September 2020
I enjoyed it,"Although I do agree that some of the CGI was bad. I watched the making of the Hulk on the Sci-fi channel last night after seeing the movie and I understand why. Ang Lee acted out the moments in a suit that captured his moves and later had them enhanced with computer graphics. He moved too fast almost like a karate movie. I felt that the Hulk sometimes moved to fast and it probably came from Ang's movements. The CGI animators really only put on the screen what Lee gave them. But that being said the movie still worked and some of the special effects were amazing. I was able to look past it.

Now some are complaining about the setup and the amount of time it takes before you actually see the Hulk (45 minutes). Did you people see Superman? Spiderman? Batman? There was less setup time in this movie then most super hero movies. The setup time here was definitely needed. I watched the tv series but did I know how Banner became the Hulk? I didn't. So that part of this movie was very entertaining to me.

One guy says that he didn't see Hulk save anyone? What were you watching? He saved Jennifer Connolly in the movie. Did you go get popcorn during that part? Worst movie ever made? Come one guy. You don't get out much do you?

The story for this movie was really good. The movie was 2 hour and 15 minutes and it was a fast 2 hour and 15 minutes. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a super hero movie. Kinda reminded me of King Kong. Another one - how long did it take before King Kong appeared???? There is more to the story then a big green guy going around destroying things. 7 out of 10.",7.0,23 June 2003
Flawlessly Awful,"If there was ever a wrong director for a movie, this is it. He takes this entire movie way too seriously. At least with Spiderman and X-Men the directors knew that when translating an unrealistic comic book to a movie with actual actors you must have some sense of humor (and they did it well). The actors in this movie are forced to deliver their lines with such seriousness in tone and expression that this in itself is almost humorous. This movie badly needs to lighten up.

Right from the start we are thrust full speed into a very slow paced movie. It takes around 45 minutes of tedious, unnecessary dialogs before we even get the change to glimpse the Hulk himself. And it seems that even the scenes with the Hulk are void of any true action. I did not mind the CGI, it's more of the character that bothered me. He is by no means raging, but rather seems quite passionate in many scenes. And the action sequences are merely a repetition of a massive amounts of Army machinery hopelessly shooting everything possible at a running green Gumby.

Jennifer Connelly's motive is never really explained or clear. She loves him, yet she seems to always be the reason he gets captured. The movie's dialog is made up entirely of characters either screaming or whispering, no one seems to understand the beauty of a normally spoken conversation.

The special effects are completely overdone. With the exception of maybe a few frames of this movie, which they probably forgot to cut, every camera shot of people speaking is zoomed into a head shot so close that the actors might as well be sitting in a room talking into a microphone with no scenery around them. Almost every time the scene changes it fades into the next scene using a fade effect you might find built into a consumer camcorder (yes, this is utterly overdone). The few scene changes that lack this effect are graced with flashy, completely pointless computer graphics rapidly flying through the screen.

The limited minutes in this movie that are not occupied by people talking through pages of pointless, dragged-out script are riddled with moving and multiplying camera angles. It usually shows the same picture at 3-5 different camera angles at once, and at some points ventures into displaying multiple scenes on the screen simultaneously. Is this an attempt to make the movie appear more comicbookish? They certainly fail to accomplish that goal. It does, however, become quite irritating and very dizzying to attempt to follow. It reminded me of those annoying pop-up windows you get on some Internet websites, only these windows kept moving.

With so much talking and dialog you would think a movie over two hours in length would include some character development. On the contrary, throughout the entire movie there is not a single character that you will care about. The plot is confusing, overdone and overly complex in many respects, and much longer than it had to be (and should have been).

If you have not seen this movie yet and still feel a need to put in the time, effort and money it requires, wait until it comes out on DVD. This way you could skip to the only two action sequences watch-worthy - the tanks in the dessert and the mutated dogs. To see this movie in a theater you will have to endure many slow, long, un-fulfilling dialogs that will test your ability to stay awake.",1.0,30 June 2003
Surprisingly good,"I had rather low expectations before seeing Hulk, since the early criticism was pretty harsh and basically the whole mojo around this movie didn't sound very good. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. As many previous reviewers pointed out, Ang Lee has created a marvelous movie/comic book amalgam, which may be too cerebral to most of the viewers, but Hulk has always been pretty complicated character anyway. If the movie had been made as a ""Hulk Smash!"" bruhaha it would most certainly...well, suck! This way we got excellent Sam Elliot and Jennifer Connely, and very good Nick Nolte and Eric Bana, all capped with absolutely brilliant directing by Ang Lee. If only all the other comic book movies were directed in this way...",,2 November 2003
The first superhero movie that had some inner meaning,"Ang Lee uses the metaphor of the Hulk to tell the story of a person dealing with anger. For me this was a first. Although, maybe all cinema is a metaphor for inner reality.",7.0,20 August 2020
Better than I thought.,"Based on many reviews, I was not expecting to like this. It honestly worked out in the end. It's got some issues here and there, but it all together it was pretty entertaining. They go the settle route and add drama/scientific talking scenes instead of full blown action scenes all around, it really works out. I mean the action scenes they gave us were pretty enjoyable.

It does well with giving us the back story of Bruce Banner, leading up to his gamma ray exposure, introducing his ex girlfriend, his job, etc. The infamous General jackass, who refuses to listen to reason, is played well by Sam Elliot. His conversations with his daughter are handled pretty well, with his over protection and her dedication to helping Bruce hit each other hard. The scenes with Hulk, (about 3 or 4 extended scenes) are really entertaining. The visuals on him aren't the best, but it's not too noticeable. The editing is very strange, it works with several boxes of views like straight out of a Tarantino film. I don't know if that was trying to signify it as a comic book film or what, but it was kind of goofy.

I didn't care too much for Nick Nolte's role in the film. The father of Bruce who returns after 30 years to see Bruce after his gamma ray exposure, trying to unleash the Hulk in him to take revenge on the military that ruined his research years ago. What I like about Hulk is the idea that only Bruce knows his powers and how to control them. Then it gives us this thing that his father knew all along and tried to control it for him, and he is the one the controls Bruce to use his powers of anger. That was a little weird in my opinion. Nick Nolte plays him okay, but his role is just kind of stupid. In the end, I don't see why this isn't that appreciated. Nothing about it is great, but nothing is really that bad either. It has solid action and solid dialogue in it, some goofy stuff also, but what comic book film doesn't? I think it does its job fine, and in the end it's worth checking out.",7.0,8 May 2014

Easily the worst movie I have ever seen.,"The first time I tried to watch it, I had to turn it off. It was that bad. Let me explain this to you; I don't EVER turn off movies or leave

before they are over. My motto is ""Every movie has at least 1 thing about it that is good"". I have gone to the local video store and rented everything in the old

release section, starting with the 'A's and making my way

alphabetically. And I never turned anything off before. Never. I have sat through crappy horror movies, boring dramas,

braindead action movies, sappy romances, and unfunny comedies. I have sat through bad porn. I have sat through bad gay porn, and I'm NOT GAY!! I have sat through the Star Wars Holiday Special. This is what it means when I say that the film was so bad that I

had to turn it off.

I gave it a second try, and managed to force my way through until

the end. The movie sucks. I was expecting a bad, cheesy action movie with mediocre special

effects. I was right, but it was also an incredibly long, drawn out,

slow paced, nonsensical piece of utter garbage. The dialogue not only is extremely poorly written, but the

characters talk at length about nothing. There's this one scene in the movie where Betty Ross goes to talk

to David Banner, presumably for a specific reason, and the scene

goes like this: She walks in and introduces herself. He rants, raves, and drools for something like 10 minutes. She walks back out again. What the HECK was the point of that!?

The casting was bad, the acting was good only in the sense that

they did what the director wanted. The CGI Hulk effects were

cartoonish and he looks somehow a bit Chinese.

The movie is bad. Not ""so bad it's funny"", not ""purposefully bad to

make a point"", not ""low-budget bad"", just BAD in the strictest

sense meaning evil, painful, and malevolent. I tried to make fun of

it as I watched it, as that is one way to get entertainment out of a

bad movie, but it was just too bad. My normally quick wit was

paralyzed by the sheer awfulness of this film.

I tried watching it again one time, just to see if it was as bad as i

remembered, but my eyeballs took such offense to the notion that I

might once again subject them to the pure and utter hell that is this

movie, that they popped out of my eye-sockets and tried to roll out

the front door. I crawled along the floor, bleeding out of my empty eye-sockets

and listening for their squishy rolling sounds. Eventually I caught

them, washed the dust and cat-hair off of them, and put them back

in. It took me several hours to do this, and I somehow got one of

them in backwards. But, all in all, it was far more enjoyable than sitting through this

pitiful excuse for a film a second time.",1.0,28 September 2004
"despite poorly aged CGI this is the most ""real"" Hulk there is","When i first saw this in the theater (back in 2003) - it wasn't what I wanted it to be. The story seemed slow-ish, Ang Lee's direction was too different/too flashy and I didn't love Eric Bana as Bruce Banner. I've grown to really appreciate Eric Bana's quiet rage. I've always felt - when there's an intelligent character - the less science dialogue, the better. By comparison, the current Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is loud, friendly, and outgoing but is totally unbelievable as a, ""genius"" and isn't what Bruce Banner was written to be (quiet, shy, awkward, etc.). Banner was never meant to the the loud-genius that Tony Stark is. All these years later, I find that Eric Bana's Bruce Banner is more true to the written character of Bruce Banner. ...and so is Sam Elliot's General Ross. ...and while I liked William Hurt as Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross in the newer Marvel movies - Sam Elliot looks, sounds and acts exactly as Ross should. His rage almost matches Bruce Banner's! The story of this 2003 is Hulk is both strong and weak at the same time. EXCELLENT repressed rage back story but weak present day story and, ""villain"" match-up. Jennifer Connelly is quite good as Betty Ross and while I didn't love his featured villain story arc - Nick Nolte gave an excellent performance.

What hurts this movie (when viewing it in the present day) is the CGI. The color green they used for the Hulk was far too bright! Ironically, that's a detail that's true to the comic book - but does not look great on film. That's exactly what they were going for when paired with Ang Lee's comic-book style direction choice - but it doesn't look great when compared the recent muted, ""realistic"" adaptations of these characters.

This movie would have been better if some (not all) of the plot was re-written and the CGI was better. I DO think Ang Lee's direction has aged well. It's still, ""different"" - but i've grown to appreciate it more. ...and given time to compare these actors to the more recent portrayals of Bruce Banner (Edward Norton and Mark Ruffalo) - I feel that Bana gave the most accurate, strong performance. It's on the dull side but remember, Bruce Banner isn't Tony Stark.

It's a fun watch - and a better movie than I remembered it. I just can't help feeling that it could have been MUCH better. Again, the color choice and CGI of the Hulk really affect the viewing... as does a weak-ish plot.",7.0,2 July 2022

Wonderful Piece of art - incredibly underrated,"In a time where superhero movies seem to come from the assembly line and standards are (sadly) set already it is hard to find gems that really transcend these paradigms.

Ang Lee made a different approach to the superhero genre - and the people didn't like it! Why? After Daredevil, Blade, Elektra, Aeon Flux, League of extraordinary gentlemen, Spiderman (yes, i mean it), Spawn, etc etc there are many parallels you can draw between superhero films. And Hulk is the only thing that the others aren't: un-American! In a very rare exception we have a film here that doesn't have the arrogance and straight-forward story that we seem to have gotten used to too easily.

Spiderman (in particular) follows the EXACT steps you can read in a tutorial for film making - that may be neat to watch but leaves no space for surprises or artistic inputs. Ang Lee seems to have taken especially this thought very seriously and created a piece of art that the average pop-corn-formula-film-liking movie-goer may find hard to digest. No doubt, this movie is not made for assembly-line-film-lovers - it is constructed very thoughtfully and goes beyond the interpretation of a superhero. It plays with the chaos that erupts out of the events rather than glorifying another world saviour.

There is no real good and evil, there only is an overcharge from both sides that don't know how to master the situation. The American movie-goer averagely wants black and white sides, a proud US-flag waving and a hero that saves the day (+nation and eventually the world, maybe even the universe). Nope, not in this one. While most of the other films establish superheroes as something that fits perfectly into our society, Hulk plays with the idea of what would happen if unknown uncontrolled untameable power surfaces - and that both sides act incredibly humane. At this point 80% of movie-consumers are out and 90% of movie-lovers come in (that number is small as we know).

I appreciated the rather unconventional storytelling, I admire the cast, I treasure the artistic hybrid of comic and reality and I enjoyed the portrayal of energy. Now, anyone who has seen Asian action films will find many parallels - the question is, are YOU ready to adapt to some of those standards when they are being poured over a western story? I was... And I was overwhelmed!

Anyone calling this movie the worst film they've ever seen (and there are quite few stating this) should stay with Spiderman, Transformers and Blade and get the same product over and over again (because they keep buying it). For my part I was grateful to see that there are people out there who get the chance to put a very distinctive stamp on their work making it unique and deep.

Five years later the audience won and an assembly line version was released, not as bad as some others but definitely not as creative and visionary as this one. Great job Ang!!!!!",8.0,23 February 2011

1. Hulk as CGI - works most of the time, some of the time it doesn't. Nobody can argue with that. But, like Gollum, the expressions of the face and the fantastic body language made you WANT to believe. Unlike Gollum, some of the shots just don't work at all. The big CG breakthrough for this movie - the manipulation of real settings was just SPECTACULAR. I fully belived that San Fran was getting torn apart.

2. Too long. Cut a half hour.

3. The comic book style - hit and miss.

4. Most of my friends hated the movie, yet.....

5. ..... I found many of the scenes to be incredibly moving, which took me by surprise. Though I secretly hoped that the Hulk would just be ICE Storm with Hulk in the Joan Allen role, I have to admit that Lee pulled off one helluva feat. I sympathized more for the hulk than the entire MATRIX cast (of both movies) combined. And I'll take a faulted movie with emotion over almost any big budget vehicle any day.

The L Man",,22 June 2003
What went wrong?,"Ang Lee attempted a different approach in his direction in Hulk. The recipe for superhero comic book movie was not followed and for that, it failed in entertaining the mainstream audience. It is more off-beat, more difficult. The music score by Danny Elfman is much heavier than on the average Spider-Man film. The character is not a hero--nor is he a villain. It is a dark story of a pretty dark character. I believe that this is its essentially biggest problem: it is humourless to the core and when featuring a dark character like the Hulk, you need some serious light-hearted comic relief to counter it.

I barely even recalled the plot after having watched Hulk, but I remember that it was paper-thin. It's mostly Eric Bana as Bruce Banner coming to terms with his new green identity and the conflicts that this curse this brings. While Bana acts with more conviction and skill than any of the superhero actors (Tobey Maguire, Brandon Routh, even Christian Bale), he is only ever used for acting that varies between the extremes sad or confused in the film. It is not fair that this fantastically talented man is overshadowed by the alter ego of his character.

The action scenes are also sub-par and rare. When they are attempted, Lee makes them too overblown to emphasize the sheer strength of the Hulk--and we have a green CGI monster in purple pants spiraling up in the sky--a Shrek on steroids. This may sound like the comic relief that was needed, but it isn't funny -- it's mostly bizarre. Some well-placed and traditional action scenes could and should have been included, in my opinion. It's not ""selling out"" so much as it's balancing the dark Hulk with light entertainment. If you make everything dark, then the character is not going to look dark or stand out.

Still, I prefer Hulk to either of the Spider-Man films any day, probably because it has an interesting approach to it. Just..sometimes a little too difficult. 6/10",6.0,16 July 2006
not nearly as bad as is rumoured,"Gets an A for effort.

The filmmakers tried hard to make an intelligent movie that emulates the style of a comic book. They succeed on both counts - the characters and relationships have depth, and the visuals are dynamic and fun.

But the realistic characters are actually a bit of a problem, perhaps because that's not what comic books are about. The way straightforward drama clashes with extraordinary events will at times make what's happening on screen seem quite silly. Also, plot-wise, exactly what happens at the climax is unclear.

As for the Hulk himself, the special effects, though not amazing, are fine.",7.0,22 April 2005
"Hulk excells in Effects, but sadly, story is slow...","As the title suggests, The Hulk motion picture turned out to be loaded with plenty of excellent special effects, but the story needed a huge pick up. Sure Eric Bana, Jennifer Connley(sorry if I misspelled her last name.), and Nick Nolte make a great on-screen trio, but not even their excellent acting could make up for the slow paced story. Sadly, I don't think that a sequel will be possible, unless this movie really racks up good bucks. But all that aside, the fully digital Hulk really stuck out as the best part of the movie. The way he smashed up everything and anything, including the ""Mutant French Poodle"", was enough to keep me hooked. See the movie, but don't expect much.",1.0,23 June 2003
Delves deep into characters and story. Although the effects are dated.,"One of my favourite Marvel films, I do like the casting of the characters, especially of Nick Nolte as David Banner. I love the storyline, I love the more than black/white character development in many of the characters, again, with David Banner. The effects for the Hulk seem to have dated quite a bit, although much of the rest of the effects seem to hold well. I do feel there was a little too much talking in some places, but I thoroughly enjoyed the story over the action, and if comparing this one with the 2008 version, I'd probably choose this one, due to better acting and story. XD Overall, very good film, with it just being a little too much like a drama rather than a superhero film.",7.0,30 April 2016

surprising art film,"Hulk is a very surprising film. When I first saw it when I was like nine or ten I was confused, shocked and somewhat disappointed. My expectations at the time had not been met. What I had been expecting and hoping was just endless scenes of the hulk smashing sh#t up. What I got was an art film. At the time I didn't understand or care about any of the split screens, dream sequences, etc, I was just waiting for the hulk to show up and destroy stuff.(The hulk dosen't show up till about 40 minutes into the movie, by the way.) I eventually began to get restless because it is a very slow movie and when it was over I felt very disappointed.

A few years later I bought the DVD to give it another try, and I was very surprised with how good it actually was, now that I had gotten older and could appreciate the style, acting and pretty much everything else. The acting is quite good in the film, especially Nick Nolte, who almost steals the show as Bruce Banner's father, David Banner. Eric Bana is decent as the hulk, but I prefer Mark Ruffalo as the hulk in the avengers. Unlike other movies based on comic books, Hulk actually looks like a comic book, due to the split screens. This works most of the time,as it gives the film a unique look thats different from other comic book movies.

Now to the much criticised CGI, which for me is a mixed bag. The close ups of the hulk work, because his facial expressions are well done and you can actually feel sympathy for him. However the long shots of him, especially in the desert scenes, look a bit cheesy but definitely not as bad as some critics have been saying. Apart from that the visual effects are top notch.

Overall, Hulk is a refreshing change from standard and bland superhero movies. It takes its time setting up the plot and characters, which works because you have almost fully fleshed out characters and not cardboard cut outs. The repressed memories and psychology of the hulk is much more interesting than the standard heroics of superman or captain America. So to sum it up, I wouldn't recommend this movie to young kids because there are a number of intense scenes and it is a fairly long and slow movie, so those with short attention spans won't be well rewarded. But for those who are prepared to accept that it is more an art film than an action film then you will be well rewarded.

The film isn't perfect, but every time I watch it on DVD it grows on me and I find myself wishing sometimes that more action blockbusters were like this, but then if they were I doubt they would be blockbusters.",8.0,23 July 2012
"The Story Could Be Shorter and With More Action Scenes, But Entertains","Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a geneticist working with her colleague and former lover Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) in a laboratory in a military base. One day, he is exposed to gamma rays when protecting a colleague from an accidental operation of Betty. This exposure releases Hulk, a green monster. Bruce becomes aware that he is the fruit of a genetic experience of his crazy father, David Banner (Nick Nolte).

The approach of Ang Lee to the story of Hulk is not bad. However, the screenplay could be shorter and less dramatic, since fans of Hulk certainly like action movies. I myself do not like the technique of using of split screen, maybe with the intention to be similar to a cartoon. In my opinion, the graphics of Hulk make him look like Shrek. Maybe, the use of a very strong actor would be better than the virtual character. But anyway, it entertains, and it is very above the average of similar movies. However, Daredevil, Spiderman and X-Men are better and better. My vote is six.

Know that it is long; understand that it is great.,"The best thing that happened before I saw Ang Lee's Hulk, was being warned how long it was. I was prepared for a film that would run slowly in parts, but took its time exploring its characters. As such, this film was one of the best of the year.

Lee created a very moving and emotional telling of the seminal comic book hero, and does so with a wonderfully innovative use of split-screen technology, which is normally a turn-off. It reminded me of what Dennis Hopper was trying to do with his flashing segeways in Easy Rider. But where Hopper failed, Lee perfects. It is not recommended that anyone try split-screen, ever. But if someone does try, they must use this film as a reference.

The cinematography and performances are stellar, especially Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, and Nick Nolte. The film is far from perfect, however. The dependable Sam Shepard is an annoying ham here, and the script does sometimes push our suspension of disbelief too far. Such is the consequense of filming the story of a monster, who only manifests when some convenient character can make him mad.

Anyone who judges this film badly because the computer generated Hulk looks synthetic, ought to stay away from this genre of films altogether.",7.0,19 July 2003
Beautiful movie,"Now I know which director I like best: it's Ang Lee, rather than John Woo. In this movie of ""Hulk"", look at the shots linked so smoothly and tactfully. Remember his movie of ""Sense and Sensibilities""? The same beautiful! John Woo is no doubt making thrillers and cool movies, the plot is always cliff-hanging and you just can't help gasping. But to the beauty of the movie, he's not better than Ang Lee. And this is maybe the reason Ang's winning Oscar and John's winning box-office.",7.0,8 September 2003

anything in the world and he doesn't even need to lift weights or do

steroids. My friend told me that at the end of this movie the Hulk

wakes up and it was all a dream but that's not true, it was different.

But hey, it would be kind of cool if Hulk woke up and he actually

lived on a Hulk planet where it was totally normal to be a hulk and

he had a family and had to mow the lawn and stuff. He could work

for a big company and wear a suit and then when they were having

a meeting in the board room hulk could get mad and smash the

table and say ""Hulk want boost profits!"" or ""Inefficiency not

tolerated by Hulk!"" My friend told me the Hulk is gay but he's not.

There's a she hulk and they love each other. My friend just said

that cause he likes the Hulk and wants to go steady but the hulk

doesn't want to. Imagine if the Hulk was doing sex to someone?

They'd probably get killed or maybe he'd be really good cause he'd

have a big one. If the Hulk did it when he was the hulk would the

baby be a hulk too? They never addressed these kind of things in

"Finally a movie came along to replace ""Disorderlies"" as the WORST movie I EVER saw!","I don't even know what to say about this movie. Since I was a kid I LOVED the Incredible Hulk. It seemed that, after the Batman fiascoes that Warner Brothers put out, the movies were getting it right with superhero films such as ""Spider-Man"" and ""X Men"". So, when I found out they were making ""The Hulk"", I was REALLY excited. The teaser looked good: Basically the side of Banner's house exploding outward as a result of him turning into the Hulk.

Then I saw the REAL trailer.

Sweet Jesus, who made this movie? Who wrote the script? Who gave the damn thing the green light and, for the love of God, why did ANY of the actor's think it was a good idea? The beginning was nothing short of excruciating - The film CRAWLS!!! I mean, I know that building the background story and the suspense to see the Hulk is important, but this just seemed tangential. Who cares?

What makes things worse is that there is no pay-off for the viewer's patience. It is unbelievable and unforgivable that in 2003 a movie could come out with CGI so SHOCKINGLY bad. It is IMPOSSIBLE to take this movie seriously. You CANNOT suspend disbelief. Maybe I am being too harsh. Nick Nolte as a mug shot come to life is mildly amusing and I guess I am glad that Sam Elliot was finally able to make a movie that makes him proud of his work in ""Roadhouse"".

Ang Lee - Go See A Shrink,"The Hulk is the story of Bruce Banner, a scientist who takes a blast of gamma radiation when saving a punk kid (Rick) who strays into a military testing area it is NOT a story about an abuse father. Ang Lee uses this movie as a vehicle to explore his fascination with father-son relationships. This is an appalling movie and whoever gave Lee licence to re-invent such a legendary comic book character should be given a lethal dose of gamma radiation, along with Ang Lee himself.

Wait for the DVD/Video release and skip to the scenes with The Hulk.

Sleeper gem that never deserved the hate.,"If you're looking for mindless action, complete with an explosion every 5 minutes like in a Michael Bay movie, this is not for you. The humor is sparse and dry, it's not for comic relief to make you feel better. This is his origin story. It's slower paced so you can understand where he comes from and what drives him.

This Bruce is emotionally-psychologically complex and introspective. This Hulk is the personification of his subconscious; of all his repressed trauma. It's catharsis and acting agent for all of Bruce's pain, anguish, isolation, his hatred in being dominated by Talbot and Ross, and his frustration over a wasted (then thwarted) relationship with Betty. And his agitation over an estranged, obsessive Father, and repeat unwelcome attempts to kindle a Father-Son relationship. His Mother is the ghost of his subconscious mind, and he's haunted by her loss. This loss defines him. He's a dark character, and is given an appropriately dark tone, with a slower pace to match. In the few quiet moments he has to himself, you're given his humanity. He'll try to calm himself down, if he's allowed to. There's glimpses of heroism in him, as when he saves Betty (and a nondescript pilot), but he's no hero. People are only afraid of him here. He's vulnerable and tentative with the one person he cares about, which is rather wholesome lol.

Cinematography wise, it's gorgeous and original. 10/10. Haven't seen anything like it before or since. Many people think the way it's shot is jarring and obnoxious; it flows like a comic book. The CGI was before it's time, it looks better than Mark Ruffalo's. He's a vivid shade of green that will play with some people's depth perception. Some complain this Hulk is ""baby faced""...as it's personification of Bruce's 4-year old traumatized mind (and is 15ft tall with more intense sound production than any Hulk after), I don't see that as a con. The dialogue can be quite profound, which some will think cringeworthy for a 'Superhero' (he's not here) movie, but that's your prerogative.

Don't bother,"So many places to start, but nothing good to say about The NOT Incredible Hulk. Boring, Boring, Boring. Any more Boring and I would have thought that this was a DC movie and not a Marvel one. Tragically awful comes to mind. I haven't seen something this bad since that Anita Bryant concert. I'm not joking. This movie S U C K S. The only saving grace is when the dialogue stops and the RAMPAGE begins!

The plot is incoherent. The original concept featured a scientist bathed in gamma rays while saving a teenager from certain death, who then turns into a muscle monster! The ""movie"" takes more than the concept of liberty with the original plotline and produces precisely what you would expect of a bad Hulk comic book. I should say MORE than bad Hulk comic book to emphasise the frequency of bad Hulk stories. This rates as top worst all time. A pre-school attempt at a serious subject.

I think that to do this movie justice I would have to rate it as below both the Captain America and the Punisher movies of the late 80's early 90's. That's bad for those of you scoring at home.

I have better things to say about Daredevil and I really didn't like that movie.

The Hulk should have been a better movie. It should have been entertaining. There is more than enough story there to accomplish this. Instead a really awful and poorly executed family trauma story between a father and a son is substituted. There is also a recurring green mushroom cloud that indicates a nuclear explosion and yet is never explained into the story.

This movie should be a ""how to screw up a good comic book idea when making a movie"" course for any potential moviemaker.

See this movie before I get angry!,"If you're expecting this film to be a movie version of the live-action TV series of the late '70s-early '80s, then you may be expecting too much. This film is in the vain of the comic book series. Still, it's an awesome flick. One might complain that the CGI-produced Hulk character looks phony. Well, he does to some extent, but the mixture of drama and action scenes make up for that.

Ang Lee, who did a great job directing the film, was wise to choose a newcomer to play Bruce Banner. I think it would have been a mistake to have gone with someone who is too well-known, because it would have been too distracting. Eric Bana was a great choice for the role of Bruce Banner. He looks very Banner-ish, and is a wonderful actor.

I also liked Sam Elliott in the role of General Ross. He fits the role very well, and I am hopeful that he will play the character again, now that Eric Bana is contracted to do at least two Hulk sequels.

Loved the design of the film,"Loved the whole design of the film being looked at as a comic film. Ang Lee's filmed version of The Hulk, unfortunately, won't appeal to all those within the mainstream spectrum of movie-goers. I can guess (hearing from a few of my friends who are true-blue comic book addicts)fans of the comic will be pleased, however those who may not be fans or admirers and are simply looking for the kind of non-stop action and campy, tongue-in-cheek humor of Spiderman may be disappointed. Ang Lee has taken Stan Lee's vision of the ultimate perturbed anti-hero and created a work that can appeal to viewers with an darker art-house sensibility as well as viewers with a thirst for action-adventure blockbusters.

In a sense this is similar to the approach Tim Burton used for Batman fourteen years ago, though his was given a shot of adrenaline and hilarity from Jack Nicholson as The Joker. The Hulk doesn't really have any overtly flamboyant characters like that to chew on the scenes they steal, so rather Lee looks at its core as a story of parents (notably fathers) and their children. Children who are tainted from missing and shattered childhoods from their before they can completely remember. Sam Elliot's Solider and Nick Nolte's Cast- out Father, perhaps, are the most important characters of the film after the protagonist Bruce Banner, as that they set the Jekyll and Hyde-esquire story in motion and carry/deliver much of the emotional weight that follows.

Eric Bana is scientist Bruce Banner, UN-wittingly following in his father's combustible career, who wants to use gamma-radiation to help out frogs in studies, and unfortunately gets caught in an accident of catastrophic proportions. There is, he finds out, something inside of him, ever since he was a child, that gets released into the open by the radiation, and the monster within becomes an unstoppable freak of nature. The gorgeous Jennifer Connelly plays his once love interest and only true friend, Betty Ross, who gets caught in a crossroads after her father, a military man who put away Banner's father away thirty years earlier, gets involved in the pursuit.",7.0,5 May 2016

Those who appreciate the comic book will appreciate the movie,"I'm surprised to see as many bad reviews here as I have. But then I realized that if Hulk has one problem, it's that it doesn't fall squarely into most of the predefined categories. While this is not a weakness in the film's quality in itself, it does result in people coming in with certain expectations, based on genre, that may not always be met. It's not purely an ""action"" film. It's also not a ""light-hearted"" adaptation, which is what many people think comic books are supposed to be. What I have to say to such people is that they need to have read past issues of Hulk comic books.

The movie Hulk reflects much of the feel and substance of the comic book. The Hulk comics are not frivolous; they are dark. They are not brain-dead action. They are full of character development and often psychological. This movie draws from the best elements of the comic book and reflects those main elements well. If some people are disappointed, it's from their own expectations of what a movie about a large, green, visceral creature with immense power would be all about.

Now on to my impressions of the merits of the movie itself:

The story itself may not have been a home run but at least it was a base hit. As I mentioned, the elements of the psychological drama of the Hulk were there. If anything, I found myself wanting to see MORE into the characters; but there's only so much time in a feature film. Which raises the question: Was Lee attempting too much depth of character for the time he had?

Given that the overall ""feel"" and main elements of the comic were maintained, I was surprised to see some of the particulars of the story as changed as they were. Especially the origin of the Hulk (the accident itself), Bruce's father being alive (as opposed to a ghost from his past), Talbot and especially the concept that the Hulk continues to grow ever larger. None of these changes seemed like IMPROVEMENTS from the comic; rather they were changes made either simply to differentiate the movie from the comic or as visual devices to make a live-action Hulk look better on the big screen. At least the Hulk wasn't mistreated in any significant way.

The casting was good. Nolte was surprisingly effective as a burned-out has-been scientist with a crazy streak (maybe recent developments in his personal life have helped with this portrayal?). Jennifer Connelly's natural beauty shone in this film and was enhanced by not being overly dolled up. She once again shows her capability as an actress; it would just be nice to see her play a leading roll instead of supporting and healing tortured but brilliant scientists.

The CGI was decent but not the best I've seen. The face was probably the biggest weakness. Still, though, anyone who has done any work with CGI must appreciate the difficulty in bringing something like the Hulk to life.

Overall, I was not disappointed with the Hulk movie. Maybe not everything was outstanding but the basic elements were there. Which says a lot coming from a long-time fan of the comic books. And, you have to face it; it was a smashing great time seeing a full-powered Hulk in a live action movie!",7.0,24 June 2003
Migraine inducing movie!,"This movie is horrendous and painfully boring to watch, it gives me a migraine to see it all the way through. The annoying comic book like split screen, especially will gives you a splitting headache. I can't believe it's rated on average any higher than 3 stars. The acting, directing, and script are a joke, such a shame that a great character like the hulk got the worst cinematic treatment of a comic book movie ever. Ang Lee's art house style of directing was probably fine for Crouching tiger, hidden dragon but in Hulk it really feels out of place.

Eric Bana is a fine actor in the other movies I've seen him in Troy and Chopper, but in this film whenever he was supposed to be enraged to the point of turning into the hulk, he seemed like a 3 year old play acting. Actually it's totally hilarious to see him gasping, groaning and struggling for breath, even the film itself makes a joke of it, when Nick Nolte mockingly imitates his childish whining and screaming towards the end.",1.0,5 November 2005

Another blockbuster disappoints,"A year on from the awful mess that was Spiderman, a new 'superhero' is transformed onto our screens with a big budget, CGI and a quality director. Everyones been talking about it and I was ready to see a decent film with some wicked computer effects. As the films not out in the UK till next friday (I saw an advance screening), I was looking forward to one of the biggest summer blockbusters of the year, and all I got in return was a numb bum. 2 hours and 15 minutes later, I walked out of the cinema without any good things to say about the film. The effects are dodgy to say the least, the Hulk's only in the film for about 15 minutes. The action sequences are dark, dis-jointed, poorly edited and as for the finale, well only Ang Lee knows what is going on!! Bana does a good job in a difficult role, Nick Nolte looks like he enjoyed himself but the other members of the cast are stale. The comic book style editing is a gimmic and it often leaves you wondering what Ang Lee is trying to tell us. Ok, the Hulk is massive and can probably kick some ass but he's never really given a chance. There's no 'baddy' as such so the story seems one sided and the running time is criminal. This film should of been a 100 minute, adrenalin rush instead I needed to be kicked every now and again so that I stayed awake! The story is dragged out and the first 45 minutes are empty. Although, the credit sequence at the start of the film is inventive, it doesnt give enough detail about the genetic engineering that provides the underlying core of the film. So, another year, another 'superhero' and another major dissapointment for the blockbuster hungry crowd. You can normally tell if a films any good by the reaction at the end of the film, everyone walked out in silence and went home! Nothing to say about a nothing film.",1.0,12 July 2003
Comic-Book Panels,"This is far better than the subsequent and trepid MCU entry, ""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008), and much other superhero fare, simply for some originality and thought being put into the visuals. Such was quite rare for the emerging genre at the turn of the century. Sure, the CGI is dated now, but it's superior to much of the cartoony leaping of figures in ""Daredevil"" (2003), ""Catwoman"" (2004) and even ""Spider-Man"" (2002). I rather like the brightness of the green here, too, which is such a relief from a lot of the needlessly dark--except to cover up CGI cheats and otherwise lack of interest--texture of many of these movies. More importantly, the camera bounds along with the Hulk. Compare that to the static views of characters supposedly gliding and web-slinging in ""Spider-Man."" Most impressive, methinks, though, are the transitions between scenes. ""Hulk"" remains unique to this day in this regard, as director Ang Lee and company experimented by making sequences appear the cinematic equivalent of comic-book panels.

It's also interesting that the story is relatively skeptical of American military might so soon for a blockbuster post 9/11 and that there's relatively less smashing than in some other supes burgers (and this despite the Hulk being larger than some other depictions, more like King Kong), but this one does follow the same plot of science-gone-wrong, simplified Jekyll/Hyde anger issues, listless love interest with Betsy, failed military containment by her father, and final confrontation with another monster that comprises ""The Incredible Hulk"" and, to a large extent, many other such movies, so that's not what's important. Perhaps, a bit more psychologizing, with repressed memories, daddy issues and dreams is here, but that's about it. The main distinction is stylistic--the recognition that cinema is a unique visual art form that requires visual adaptation, and that's what ""Hulk"" achieved.

The zooming montages through different scenes, the split-screen separation of others, different views of the same characters simultaneously--it's the best attempt I've seen at creating a cinematic comic book. The camera is quite free, too. Shots appear from various angles, often at the same time and of slightly different times. It's as though the spectator, through the camera's eye, were flipping through a comic book where motion pictures replaced the static drawings. Not only a feat of cinematography and editing, either, this, I'm also impressed with the sound design--and even the score--with accompanying such complicated layering of images.",8.0,13 July 2020
"Some of it worked, some of it didn't.","Definitely the comic book adaptation you don't want to take your little ones to. Both because it's on the boring side and because it's really dark. Ang Lee, the director of such great films like `The Ice Storm' and `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', has done something that no comic book film (or any film) has done in a while: take its time by developing the characters and actually making us care for them. I'm not saying it was the greatest move, but I was glad Ang did it.

`Hulk' is just the latest comic book to be made into a movie, following in the tracks of `X-Men', `Spider-Man', `Daredevil', and the upcoming `League of Extraordinary Gentleman'. It's not my favorite of the comic book film, nor is it my least favorite. Some of it worked, some of it didn't.

The film focuses on a scientist named Bruce Banner. Before he was born, his father (Nick Nolte), who was also a scientist, tested on himself and passed his mutated genes onto Bruce. Now, Bruce, thirty-five, and his research partner Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) are performing experiments on animals with something called 'gamma rays'. The gamma rays are supposed to help heal wounds and other injuries. But it doesn't work. Once exposed to the gamma, the animals explode. Well, one day, Bruce is accidentally exposed to a dose of gamma rays. He should be dead, but he's just fine. Pretty soon he figures out that he can turn into a muscular 10-foot-tall monster. Kind of like me when I see Jennifer Connelly.

Not my favorite comic-to-film movie. That award belongs to 1989's `Batman'. But it did remind me of `Batman' and `Superman'. Not since those films have I seen such a character-driven comic book adaptation. But it doesn't pull it off magnificently. Within the first 45 minutes, I was about to fall asleep. Well, not exactly fall asleep, but it wasn't turning out how I wanted it to. But once he (finally) turns into the Hulk, I was wide awake! Especially during that scene where he beat the living hell out of those Hulk Dogs that were exactly the same size as him. Good Stuff! I also personally enjoyed the scene where Hulk holds on to a jet as it tries to lose him by gliding up right into space. I don't mean to sound weird, but as the sound grew more quite and the further up they went into space, I found myself losing my breath. A film's never done that to me before!

But between these uber action scenes, there lies the long boring patches of talking. Not that I don't like long conversations, but I found it unnecessary to have so many of them in an action movie. I was so disappointed as the film started to get really good, but started another long boring patch. What I also didn't like was how the Hulk looked. There were a couple parts in the film where it looked so fake.....I laughed.

The acting in the film is strong. Eric Bana does pretty good as the mad, but charming scientist. And Jennifer Connelly does very well as the hard-to-get friend. Man, she is beautiful! I thought Josh Lucas did an awesome job as the enemy. With his smoldering good looks, smart ass voice, and con artist moves, he pulled it off magnificently. But I think the stand-out performance is Nick Nolte. People have been crapping all over this character, calling it an unnecessary subplot. But I uberly disagree! I enjoyed it as he used his rough voice, scary eyes, and his mug shot-looking haircut to the fullest!

I appreciate what Ang did with the film. I think he just to comic book films to the next level. But, hey, buddy, you really could have laid off all the drama. You could have cut the film down from its 2 hour and 20 minute running time to a cool 1 hour and 50 minutes. I don't think we would have missed anything.

An over `okay' comic book picture. Although it doesn't match up against this year's earlier comic book films, it still deserves a look.

Anyone who says this movie was good is a poseur,"People will use the ""soccer defense"" for this movie. That is, they will say it only seems so unbelievably dull because we average rational human beings are not sophisticated enough to understand/appreciate the high culture involved. Baloney. Ang Lee did nothing but take a movie about a giant green monster and make it boring. An impressive feat, mind you, but not one anyone should pay money to go see. Don't give me any nonsense about how he wanted to make it more than just a typical smash em up movie. First of all, a movie about the Hulk SHOULD be a smash em up movie. Secondly, for the 70 insufferable minutes of backstory and character development we get before we even see a HINT of green, the characters wind up being paper thin! I mean, what do we really know about Bruce other than that he was adopted at a young age and he's a big moralist. Zippo. And I HATE when Directors try to be arty in something that is just NOT an art film, to show how avant garde they are. He used the ""24"" esque split-screen technique to give this movie a ""comic book feel?"" Hey, I've got an idea Ang. Why not use your DIRECTION to give it a comic book feel instead of playing camera games? And 2 hours and 18 minutes for a movie about the Hulk? Hey, Ang, get over yourself and learn to edit. Finally, what was all that business about his father? The way I remember it, Bruce Banner became the Hulk when he got caught in the blast rescuing Rick Jones from the Gamma Bomb he helped to create. Is this tedious new story all Ang's creation? If so, WHY?? Ick. Don't waste your time with this literal monstrosity. 0/10",1.0,29 June 2003
Painfully terrible,,,30 May 2007
Good if you are a Hulk fan,"The hulk is a contrasting superhero He is big and strong and indestructible but yet the person behind him is solitary, lonely and emotionally sensitive. In a way he is a modernized version of Frankenstein meets Jekel and Hyde.

This movie did a good job on starting out the dramatic side of the hulk but spent too much time on the setup before he was created. Eric Bana is a great actor who did a great job on this movie, and Jennifer Connelly was beautiful and lovable. Even the bad guys were well acted Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot were convincing bad-guys.

Even though this sounds cheesy (real Hulk fans will know this) The movie would have benefited if there was a narration going on giving you some intraspective of what Bruce was thinking. I also think it would have benefited more the movie showed a little of the loner deeds of the Hulk.",7.0,17 January 2009
Misunderstood and very enjoyable,"The general consensus seems to be 'it's too dull, nothing happens'. And this is exactly what's wrong with movie audiences today. They don't haven't the patience. Because here Ang Lee has done something amazing with a comic book - he's made a piece of art on film.

Granted, he takes things too seriously at times, and Banner never smiles, but for the most part the movie works. For all the Hulk smash-smashy stuff to work you need to get to know the characters first and you'd be forgiven for thinking you were watching another character drama instead of a huge Hollywood comic book adaptation. The studio wrongly sold the film as an all-out action fest, when really it has very little to do with FX and spectacle, although these are heavily present towards the end.

So I suppose your enjoyment of Hulk depends on whether you want to see a movie with an open mind or you want to pick it apart for what it 'should have been' (fanboys I'm looking at you). Oh and the editing is just amazing.",7.0,28 July 2003
Cannot believe the positive reviews...,"Given my summary, no doubt anyone reading further has a pretty good idea of what I'm about to say. The Hulk sucked. Bad. I mean, Toxic Avenger held my interest far longer than The Hulk ever did. And that's just downright sad.

Now, to be fair, the acting was well done and I have no real issues in that department. Eric Bana played a believable enough Bruce Banner. Nick Nolte is as good as he ever is and is incredibly creepy in his role as Bruce's father. Now, let's get to the storyline. Ok, I have to admit I was disappointed to see some changes, but they weren't anything I couldn't deal with; nor was it enough to truly detract from the movie. In and of itself, the storyline was, well, ok. Not fantastic, not great, not awesome, but ok. I can live with that.

So, if not the acting or storyline, what was so bad about the Hulk? The unbelievably ridiculous excuse for CG, that's what. Toy Story looked more ""real"" than any moment of CG in The Hulk. It was absolutely pathetic. Basically, the CG reduced The Hulk to nothing but a cartoon on steroids. Based on the trailers, I had a pretty good idea that was going to happen, but I held out hope. Unfortunately, that hope was short-lived as the movie turned out to be exactly what I feared it would. The fight scenes were reminiscent of King Kong being attacked by the airplanes or the end battle in Mortal Kombat 2. Horrible and most of all, super cheesy.

Please, don't waste 8 bucks on this one. At the very least, wait until it hits the dollar theatre and use the other seven for popcorn and soda...it'll be far more worth it. I'm not even giving this one stars.",3.0,3 July 2003
This movie was uneven but has some elements that make it worth a watch,"Hulk (2003) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows a scientist with a traumatic childhood that he barely remembers but has nightmares about. When a series of tests go wrong and blow up in his face he is turned into a mean, green fighting machine. It could be those responsible for the experiment going wrong will try to capture and harness him. Meanwhile his past is bound to resurface.

This movie is directed by legend Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and stars Eric Bana (Troy), Jennifer Connelly (Requiem for a Dream), Sam Elliott (Roadhouse), Josh Lucas (Ford vs Ferrari) and Nick Nolte (48 hrs).

This cast is absolutely awesome and with a better written film could have been a masterpiece. Elliott was a tremendous Ross. Unfortunately, the father son storyline didn't work for me and their face off towards the end to deal with their problems was the worst part of the movie. However, the CGI did work for me and I liked the look of The Hulk. His action scenes were good, especially the fight versus the dogs and Hulk's escape from the base. The ending was just okay and could have been better and relied too much on CGI.

Overall this movie was uneven but has some elements that make it worth a watch. I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",7.0,27 July 2022
The Incredible Nothing,"With the one-two punch of the entertaining Bryan Singer-helmed X-Men films and Sam Raimi's brilliant Spider-Man take, it seemed like comic films had finally found their way. It really WAS possible to tell the deep, moving plot line that has entranced comic readers for decades while including the requisite explosions that have also entranced comic readers for decades. Naturally, when I saw the trailer for the Hulk, I was expecting Bruce Banner to get an equally good treatment. I mean, they brought in Ang Lee, meaning they wanted a more serious exploration into the Hulk's multiple personas, right? And the man knows his wire-fu, so the action sequences would be good too, right?

Wrong. The Hulk was one of the most painful theatrical experiences of my lifetime. It even managed to top Wild Wild West and The League of Extraordinary Gentleman for cinematic torture. Of course, that two hour run time of badness can do anyone in. At least those films were short enough to escape from. The Hulk is not only bad, it's long too. The more recent Batman Begins clocked in ten minutes longer than this and and it just zooms by while achieving everything the Hulk fails at. And that had the Memento guy helming it for crying out loud!

Let's get something straight - many in the media and the internet are under the impression that The Hulk is some grand artistic opus overlooked by dumb theater goers due to lack of explosions. They laud it's artistic vision, it's brilliant insight into Banner's head, and a bunch of other artsy crap. These elements ARE NOT IN THIS FILM. The movie I saw was so caught up in convincing the audience it was smart that I was just waiting for the ""Oscar Moment"" subtitles to pop up. Sadly, it's hoodwinked quite a few people into its vision. People who should know better. Hence why this review exists.

No, this film is a cinematic Seinfeld. This film is about nothing. On top of the title character not even appearing for the first third of the film - we learn absolutely nothing about Bruce Banner to make us care about him. He is a total blank slate. Eric Bana is a fine actor, but his Bruce is someone I never cared about. And there's plenty of angles they could have used to make Bruce intriguing, all of which Marvel Comics has gone in depth over(Grey Hulk anyone?). There's a lot to the Hulk character but Ang Lee never got it - he just liked making pretty pictures and vague plot points that amounted to nothing.

Then there's the conflict with his father. Namely - his creepy dad is trying to do...something. The film doesn't really tell you what. It does use that clever smokescreen of being vague so you supposedly need to analyze to find the plot, but no, deep analysis reveals dad is nothing but a creepy old guy with mutant poodles. At the end of the film, his showdown with Bruce is nothing but a giant metaphor for...nothing.

We get a lot of flashbacks, supposedly to establish conflict. They add nothing to the film except that Bruce's dad is Not A Good Person. We get shots into Bruce's head that are supposed to show an identity crisis. But since we never get anything resembling an identity from Bruce, there's no involvement in his crisis. And naturally, these scenes are way too long and go nowhere. That's not artistic vision - that's someone stumbling around trying to find something more to do with the concept than ""Hulk smash!"" There's nothing for the Hulk to define himself against - we are given a few vague sources of antagonism. The military sort of plays a role - nothing like a good cliché in our monster movie. But for a film that's supposed to be innovative in its presentation, how come the best they can up with for the military are nothing but tired clichés? It's as though they exist solely so someone can throw tanks at the Hulk.

Oh, sure, there's action sequences, but those are boring too. The only thing the film gets right is that helicopters are not giant tanks of nitroglycerin waiting to go off at the slightest touch. But we do get a thirty minute or so chase sequence through the desert where Hulk jumps...and jumps...and jumps...and winds up in San Francisco so he can...wind up right back where he started! Oh sure, he overturns some tanks and helicopters on the way, but we just had a thirty minute chase sequence go absolutely nowhere but boy did it buffer that artistic runtime.

Folks - do not be fooled. This film is not an unsung classic. It is undeserved of that praise. Bruce Banner's consciousness has been explored in depth in his comics since the 70's, and Ang Lee couldn't even get close to it in three hours. Even the TV series had a better shot at the character and he wasn't even named Bruce in that one. There are plenty of better three hour films out there, and plenty of better comic films out there.",1.0,26 January 2006
"Hulk Smash (well, not exactly)","Much more effective rendition of big green than 'The Hulk', the first act ably captures the feeling of perpetual roaming that is such an important element of the character, emphasising Bruce Banner's humanity through his human contacts. Meaning no disrespect to Eric Bana, but Edward Norton is more believable as the cerebral Banner, and Liv Tyler with her glasses on is sufficiently bookish for Betty Ross. A great cameo by Tim Blake Nelson (with a hint of Simpsons' nutty professor) is just manic enough without being overly comedic. Unfortunately for a Marvel flick I feel that it was let down by the action sequences, but I suppose it could have been worse, I could have been viewing in 3D, good enough in the end, but roll on The Avengers.",7.0,27 September 2013
Worst SuperHero Movie Ever - Bar None!!,"This movie sucked like a Hoover and that is an insult to the Hoover corporation.

I try to take at least one positive thing from every movie I see but ""The Hulk"" really had me challenged. The plot was boring, the acting was poor, the CGI was dreadful and the direction was non-existent. In short this movie lacked in areas I had never believed existed.

I realise that taste is an individual thing but I am at a loss as to how anyone could like this pile of rubbish. I saw this movie once only (on DVD, thank God I did not waste the money at the box office), and have been traumatised ever since.

""The Hulk"" should be standard viewing for anyone looking to get into the movie making business as how NOT to go about making a movie.

The most underrated film of all time,,10.0,17 May 2019
Enjoyed the movie very much,,7.0,1 March 2015
Crap-tacular!,"Why did I hate this movie so much? Is it because I grew up surrounded by comic book geeks and have therefore absorbed comic knowledge through osmosis? Is it because I'm a military brat so I typically get a touch defensive when the military is portrayed as rabidly evil? Is it because I've worked in labs so I'm too familiar with science to enjoy the Hollywoodization of biology? -Ex. David Banner is shown running a PCR analysis in 1965, too bad Cary Mullis, who won the Nobel Prize for the technology, was not only a child, but was about thirty years away from publishing his finding!? Is it because I typically like Ang Lee movies so I had high expectations? Is it because I suffered through this mess because I kept thinking ""This movie stinks, but Eric Bana's hot."" I guess that's the punishment for being shallow.

The bottom line is the motivations of the characters are preposterous or unclear, the supposed troubled love affair between Betty and Bruce is never fully explored and there are huge plot holes. There's no real pay-off in the end, and you basically are left thinking ""what the hell just happened?"" I don't blame the actors-I typically enjoy Bana, Connelly and Elliot, they were stuck with stilted dialogue and erratic direction. I blame the producers for giving the job to Lee whose talents lie in smaller, more intimate stories. Bottom line: stay away, far, far away.",1.0,20 June 2004
Somewhat Wasted Potential,"What could have gone wrong with 'Hulk'? It's based on a comic book series, is directed by an accomplished director, has some great actors...so what happened? Well, to start, there isn't enough action and Hulk is introduced almost after the first 45 minutes. While many have complained that the story was too intelligent which is why the film wasn't well accepted by the masses as they were expecting an action film...well, that doesn't bother me. In fact, I loved movies that tell a good story but it wouldn't have hurt to add some more action. The pacing is very slow. Even though it gradually picks up after hulk is introduced, it slows down again. I found the overuse splitscreen (to create a comic-book panel 'effect') irritating. If it wanted to give the feel of a comic book, why not go the 'Sin City' way?I have never thought of Ang Lee to be among the greatest director as I very much disliked 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' and here too he does not impress much. The CG effects are quite poor. It reminds one of the mid-90's films.

On the bright side, I liked how the characters of Bruce Banner/hulk and Betty Ross were written. They're not your typical comic book characters. 'Hulk' is blessed with some good performances. Eric Bana is very convincing in the main lead. The ravishing Jennifer Connelly is equally effective and she's a lot more than a clichéd love interest. Both actors share great chemistry. I thought Nick Nolte gave an imbalanced performance. At times he seems to be informed and at times he hams. Sam Elliot does well with what he's given. Cinematography's quite alright and some of the landscape locations are stunning. The psychedelic dream sequences are dazzling too.

While I appreciate that the makers tried to tell a good story, 'Hulk' fails to impress as a whole. Still, I'd say it's an okay movie. If the film was a success, a sequel could have been expected. Perhaps they could still do one by avoiding the flaws of this one.",,6 March 2008
"very disappointing, but it does have cool effects and good performances","Hulk is poorly directed. I know it. You know it. Ang Lee knows it. However, while the direction nearly destroys the film, the performances of Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, and Nick Nolte are the saviors of the film. Bana is great as the ferocious green brute, catching every emotion that is required playing the most complex character in the Marvel universe...well The Punisher's up there too, but whatever. Connelly as Betty Ross is a good move, and the Oscar winner does not mess up. She is extremely likable as the love interest of Bruce Banner, more likable then Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson, Katie Holmes' Rachel Dawes, or Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane. Nick Nolte as the father to Bruce (simply credited as the greatest credit ever: father) is bone chilling and creepy. He plays a wonderful David Banner in this film, and he becomes a classic villain in the film (no spoilers here). What really drags this film down is the cheesy music, crappy direction, and crappier writing. Be forewarned that the Hulk will not appear until about 45 minutes into the film, and before he appears, you'll feel extremely bored. In Spider-Man, you only had to wait about 7 minutes for Peter to get his powers, then about another 20 until he became Spider-Man. Daredevil is already born in the beginning of the film, and the Fantastic Four are created within minutes of the film's commencement. Hulk is a waste of time for the average moviegoer unless one is a comic lover or an action lover, because the action is pretty good. I liked the scenes where Hulk races away from the military, especially the ones in the desert. Bana and Connelly have great chemistry in the film, but sadly the terrible writing and direction, not to mention poor decision making overshadow this and a chilling performance from Nick Nolte.

"A total disappointment, but not unexpected.","The Hulk was a total disappointment. I thought a great director like Ang Lee could come up with a better script, especially after his last project (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon).

The Hulk never made me care about any of the characters. Not even when Hulk saved the Golden Gate bridge from disaster by jumping on the fighter plane. By that point I didn't care about him.

Jennifer Conley's talent was wasted on this role.

The special effects were just okay. A major disappointment in my opinion. With movies like The Matrix and Lord of the Rings turning out top notch special effects I would have expected a Hulk that looked better than a rubber doll.

The first forty minutes of the movie was some of the most boring footage I've ever sat through and had to endure. I nearly left before Bana turned into the Hulk. And I wish I did because the payoff wasn't worth it.

From the Beast within,"In the past few years, ""Comic Book"" movies have become the craze. People who are extremely into comics and ones, who are not, could all come together and enjoy these movies on different levels. In allot of ways, I think the ""X-men"" movies have done the best at this, only because there is more ""mutants"" to observe. Of course the classic was ""Spider man"" and then came rolling in like a runaway train, the ""Hulk"". I was a big Hulk fan growing up, from the comic books, cartoons, and the TV series with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno. I just loved the force and power that was the Hulk. I loved how this man (that was a threat to no one) could transform into this beast that could destroy all it encountered. It was great. So I was excited when I heard the Hulk was coming out. It didn't get the best reviews and allot of people couldn't get over the Hulk being computer generated. I have to admit, I wasn't crazy about it myself. All I heard was you couldn't capture all that is the Hulk, with a man playing him. Why not? Isn't that what SFX are for? Don't tell me it couldn't have been done with an actor and with camera angles and SFX. I just don't like how they dismissed an actor, but they did and I tried to get past that. I watched it with as open of a mind as I could and I enjoyed the movie. They did add history and Hulk facts in this version that were different from the comics, but they were well done and interesting. I liked the storyline. I liked the action and this movie did do a good job of making you're heartbeat with adrenaline in those intense scenes.

I would have to give Hulk a 7.5 out of 10. It was a good movie with allot of interesting stuff. I loved the comic book style display of scenes throughout the movie. That just gave it a great feel. The computer generated Hulk was cool, but I still believe a real person would have been better. I hope the movie did enough good, to allow a sequel. If you are a Hulk fan, then check this movie out.

I am not a true Hulk fan, so I hope that is a valid statement. I don't believe the trailer (ad) from SBSunday is the same in the film. I will leave that open for discussion.

Ang Lee raped my childhood,"I waited until this movie arrived on DVD to watch it. The trailers made me feel as though this was a well-acted movie with terrible CG at the centerpiece. Boy, was I wrong. Everything about this polished turd of a film was awful. Great actors deliver canned lines from a script that is the clear product of groupthink. This film has postitively none of the emotional resonance that it should have ... or so desperately tries to attain.

Ang Lee has proven that he is not blockbuster material. The beauty of his body of work is sold short by his overuse of split screen (the TV show ""24"" knows how to use this device correctly) and jerky editing. Nevermore has one pined for a Kubrick movie (even one as mediocre as ""Eyes Wide Shut"") just to have a long, slow pan across a scene to build tension.

The 70s/80s TV version of The Incredible Hulk, even though they changed the name of the titular character and had none of the supporting characters from the original comic, still is far more powerful. You gave a damn about David Banner and wanted to tune in the next week to see him find a cure, or at least inner peace. At the end of this film, you'll be wondering: ""What in Stan Lee's name were they all thinking?""",2.0,18 January 2004
"Terrible Marketing, Great Film","""Hulk"" is a film which is widely considered a failure, both financially and artistically. Yet in the latter category this movie has a lot on offer: masterful editing, good acting and the direction of a true master.

What Ang Lee has tried to achieve, namely merging the pulp-story of the Hulk with the scale and drama of a Greek tragedy has been well achieved. The scope of the story and its effects on the characters are only to be taken seriously on a truly grand scale, and by supplying the protagonists with interwoven back-stories Lee and his screenwriters are making it clear that this is not to be seen as a realistic story, but an epic metaphor.

Special kudos goes to Timothy Squyres, who does one marvelous job of creating an editing similar to a comic's design. This pays tribute to the source material's pulp origins as well making an impressive visual statement. ""Hulk"" looks and feels like no other film, which makes it one of the most interesting, if not one of the best comic- adaptations of all time.

The crux is that this movie does not know who it's aimed at. The intellectual Ang Lee- connoisseur picks his nose when it comes to the Hulk, simply due to its humble roots, while the average popcorn-cinema-goer is slightly irritated when confronted with the films ""odd"" approach to comic-movies. This means that only viewers which are a bit of both can truly appreciate this masterpiece.

All the other elements for a good piece of entertainment are there and present: Eric Bana is, as usual, fine as the tormented soul which manifests itself in green rage, Jennifer Connelly is as solid as ever and Nick Nolte steals the show with what is a truly weird turn as Bruce Banner's/the Hulk's dad. The visual effects are beautifully executed as well. There is not much left to be desired.

A convoluted drama and THE INCREDIBLE HULK,"Director Ang Lee's 2003 ""Hulk"" is a worthwhile rendition of Marvel's Hulk. Like the '08 version, it has its strengths and weaknesses. Let's look at what works and what doesn't work:

WHAT WORKS:

What I'm most impressed with is the serious, intelligent, respectable manner in which the story is presented. There are no goofy, campy elements to be found.


Most of the casting is good: Sam Elliott as General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross and Josh Lucas as Glen Talbot.








WHAT DOESN'T WORK:







CONCLUSION: The positive aspects noted above make ""Hulk"" at least a 3/5 Star film. What I like best is the highly mature tone (Roger Ebert called it ""a thinking man's superhero film"") and the enthralling 22-minute rampage, which is worth the price of admission. But the changes in the origin story slow the film down and are presented in a generally convoluted way that lacks drive. Yet, at the same time, I appreciate the yin/yang extremes of the plot; it makes for a unique viewing experience.

In any case, the 22-minute rampage that starts at the 92-minute mark is the Hulk to a 'T' and one of the most entertaining comic-action sequences in the history of film.

Despite being based on a comic book (and TV show), ""Hulk"" is not a fast-food comic flick like, say, the 90's Batman films. This is an intelligent, well-crafted piece of cinematic art that just so happens to involve a rampaging green behemoth. At 138 minutes the film's a bit overlong, but that's okay. Just put on a pot of coffee (you're gonna need it, lol), kick back and enjoy the movie magic. This is what I just did and the film gave me a great time.

I value the '03 and '08 versions equally, but I prefer the way the Hulk looks in this version; he's more realistic whereas the Hulk in the '08 version comes off overly cartooney, albeit grittier.

Incredible,"This is a great film. I understand that there are people who will be bored by this movie in the same way that they are bored by movies like Ordinary People, Life as a House and The Cider House Rules. The Hulk is not an action movie. If you want an action movie you will be disappointed. This is a finely crafted character study in the form of a sort of Zen fable. The movie is about, on its most profound level, the danger of repressing emotion (instead of accepting them) and the danger of what happens when those bottled up emotions come out. As an example I site the scene between Bruce and Betty after the dog fight sequence. When Banner tries to describe what happened unemotionally, there is a momentary lapse during which he grabs Betty's throat; I got chills.

Ang Lee gave this movie an almost Asian feel while still keeping it accessible to American audiences who know what they are getting. He deserves the Oscar for best direction. His subtle, minimalist use of music is striking, his use of several panels in depicting certain scenes adds a stylized touch that does not detract from the film like Spike Lee's machinations do. In my opinion, there has never been a better directed film. I am sure many will disagree with me, and I understand.

Many people have mentioned that Eric Bana seemed wooden. I submit that this is true, but that it was intentional. Criticizing Bana for being unemotional and stiff as Banner is like criticizing Russell Crowe for showing no range as Maximus in Gladiator. Crowe and Bana played their characters as they were written; in Bana's case that meant stiff, stodgy and wooden.

As far as the CGI is concerned, if the CGI in The Hulk was not good enough, the tool should be retired until it is improved. It may not be perfect, but it is the best we've seen.

The performances of the other actors in this film are also quite good. Jennifer Connelly is more than adequate for her role. Nick Nolte plays David Banner as a crazed, obsessed scientist who will stop at nothing to gain power, even at his son's expense. Sam Elliot was born to play roles like Thunderbolt Ross, although the trim job on his moustache was abysmal. Josh Lucas played a spectacular Talbot with a performance that blended seamlessly into the woodwork of the picture.

It will not happen as the filmmakers marketed this picture badly and it has polarized its audience, but I would like to see The Hulk garner some Oscar recognition. In my opinion, Spider-Man was more fun, but the Hulk is the best overall comic adaptation yet.",,24 June 2003
Best comic to movie adaptation so far.,"If you're going to let people like ""princessleia912"" influence your decision to watch this movie, then you're going to miss out on the best comic to movie adaptation thus far. The aforementioned reviewer made the uneducated comment about PCR not being around in 1965 when it's obvious the movie never took place during 1965. If it was supposed to be 1965, then Bruce Banner (in the movie) would be pushing 42 when he first becomes the Hulk. I don't think so. It's more believable that he was in his twenties - which is plausible because the PCR machine was invented by Mullis in 1985 (which is twenty years later, not thirty - obviously math was not a prerequisite at the lab Miss Leia worked at). After re-watching the film I found absolutely no time reference. Anyway - don't you think a top secret government lab would have access to advanced technology before the public does? Besides - it was a movie! If you're going to nitpick - then you should hate almost every Hollywood movie ever. If you're going to down a movie because of its lack of biological accuracy - then shouldn't you feel equally miffed about all the people who get blown many feet backward when shot by hand-held firearms? That's physically impossible. So are the laws of physics to be overlooked? I think ""princessleia912"" needs to take elementary general science again. I really wish people would think before they posted comments about movies here.

Anyhow, you're reading this because you want to learn about the Hulk movie aren't you? Not to read the idiotic ranting of someone who thinks they know something (princessleia912). So I'll give you my take on the movie now.

I really enjoyed it. Sure it seemed to drag for just a minute, but the movie more than made up for it with the ton of action it delivered at the end. Although there was 45 minutes of character development to contend with - the last hour or so is pure action-packed Hulk-smash goodness. ""Depicting the military as evil"" was pretty much the theme in the original Incredible Hulk TV series - so to bring up that point is just wrong. If you liked the original show, then this movie will blow you away. If you're a fan of the comic book, you'll love this adaptation. With so many crap translations such as Daredevil and Spiderman, this movie truly surprised me by being extremely faithful to the look and feel of the comic. The CG was awesome and as good or better than anything I've ever seen in a movie - and I'm extremely picky when it comes to CG use. If you're going to talk badly about the CG in this film - then you surely must hate the CG in films such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which in my opinion was not an ounce better than this film. ILM handled the eye-candy marvelously. To whoever said The Hulk didn't look like Eric Bana - what movie were you watching? You obviously downloaded the pre-production screener off the internet or something. They couldn't have made him look anymore like the actor who played Bruce Banner without pasting his face to the Hulk's body. This movie was expertly directed right down to the excellent transition effects that take place between nearly every major scene in the movie, giving the whole thing a very comic book feel - much more so than ANY movie ever made.

I don't want to spoil anything for you or set your expectations too high, as obviously some people are stricken with bandwagonosis. So I'm just going to let you decide - but do yourself a favor and don't let some of these movie thieves, nitpickers, Hulk-haters, and wannabe-scientists impair your judgment of this excellent film. I give this movie a 10/10 for eye candy, and an 8/10 overall.",7.0,4 February 2005
"Really good, if you're in it for the story and the characters...","I can see why this got a low rating and some highly critical reviews. When you think ""The Hulk"", you don't just expect action, you expectation A-C-T-I-O-N. The very essence of disappointment is failed expectation. And this movie was far from action-centered, although not lacking in the action when it sparked. Man, once Hulk got going, there was no stopping him. No. This was a story about a character, more a drama than anything else, set on the canvas of a sci-fi legend. Interestingly enough, the TV show, that aired for several seasons, wasn't an action-centered show either. But, these days that's all people seem to want, which is why the latest rendition of the film with Ed Norton and Liv Tyler was more warmly praised and appreciated - a movie that I also thought was smokin' hot awesome. But, the director of this movie is not American. He is going to approach every movie with a non-western/non-American perspective. he took the essence of the real story and brought out all of it's best elements, particularly expressed Eric Bana's portrayal of the emotionally tormented Bruce Banner. Like I titled this review, if you want a good story with action as a seasoning to the overall stew, you'll love this movie.",7.0,30 March 2012
The worst super-hero film of all time...,"Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a geneticist who accidentally exposes himself to gamma radiation and receives the curse of turning into the Hulk (A ferocious green giant) during emotional stress. Betty (Jennifer Connelly) is the only person who can stop his anger and must find a way to save Bruce's life as well as the well-being of others.

Let me just start off by saying that this movie was horrible. It didn't start off incredibly bad. It started off somewhat interesting actually. I walked in to the theater with high expectations, so naturally I tried to enjoy the film but it was just too hard. As soon as the huge mutated dogs started to attack Jennifer Connelly and The Hulk comes and saves her, I was amazed at how much Ang Lee screwed up the blockbuster film. This movie had so much potential and failed to do anything more than confuse the audience. The effects were cheesy, the plot was stupid, and the writing was horrible. Everything about the movie was just bad, except the editing. This movie had surprisingly great editing but the rest of the movie was just so bad that it made my want to cry. The Hulk made Daredevil look like an Oscar nominee. Overall, this movie was incoherent, dull, and the ending leaves you with ""What the hell just happened"" look on your face.

I do not recommend this movie for anyone.",1.0,16 November 2005

I saw Peter Jackson's attempt at making a horror movie in 'Bad Taste' when I was thirteen and I thought that was bad, Hulk now makes it seem worthy of an Oscar!

The most introspective of the Marvel superhero movies that have come out so far,"Of all the big name superheroes Marvel has to offer, HULK is one of the easiest to gravitate to. It's not hard to find what makes him appealing. Superficially, he is an unstoppable raging behemoth whose strength is rarely matched. This alone would be an obvious foundation for a film franchise. What is surprising (and ultimately refreshing) about this one is its willingness to explore the depth of the Hulk's dilemma. If the film's jade giant were absent from this movie, its story could still be the frame for another.

The movie starts with an army scientist named David Banner who performs genetic experiments for the government. He carries one out on himself before fathering his son Bruce. After a few years into Bruce's childhood, a tragic event occurs, which results in David's incarceration for 30 years and separation from his son.

Upon maturing, Bruce also becomes a scientist. Instead of his father's obsession with genetics, he develops a fascination for gamma rays and nano-med (almost subatomic medicinal) technology. He becomes victim of a lab accident that unleashes the Hulk; partly due to genetic mutation he inherited from his father, who just happens to work on the base as janitor, recently released from his sentence. To make things more interesting, Banner's co-scientist, Betty Ross is his former flame. And she just happens to be the daughter of General Ross, the man who jailed David Banner during his family's tragedy. It is this terrible event that holds the key to why Bruce transforms to his monstrous side, and to how their reunion will end.

The movie starts slow, with admirable character development. By the time the Hulk appears, everyone's motivations are known with each personality sharply distinguished. Ang Lee loves showing humanity and human frailty in his stories as he has done exceptionally in EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN, THE WEDDING BANQUET, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, and THE ICE STORM. We discover the hidden storylines, the human aspects that can be just as interesting as the action. We discover that Bruce and Betty have both had fathers that they could never count on (that's probably what brought them together). We see David Banner and General Ross not primarily as power hungry males, but as caring fathers as well. We experience Bruce Banner's awkwardness and inability to express himself adequately, which makes us understand all the more why he begins to `enjoy' transforming into his raging alter-id.

Though it's true that the Hulk doesn't appear until 45 minute into the movie, once he does, the action hardly stops. Sure there are scenes of destruction, but they are calculated, punctuating turning points in the movie, instead of bombarding the audience as mayhem in others. The backdrops upon which these action sequences are set upon are breathtaking. The battles rage from an underground base, to the vast majestic Monument Valley landscape, all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge and even to the very stratosphere. I can still vividly recall Images of the Hulk clashing with `hulk-dogs' in the California Redwood forests and him being chased by helicopter gunships in a concave rock formation in the Arizona desert.

People remember Ang Lee for CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, which many consider (present company included) to be the greatest martial arts picture ever made. It left such big shoes to fill, even for Lee (At one point TIME Magazine labeled him, `America's Best Director'). Those who recall CROUCHING TIGER remember its sublime images of combat, but what set it apart in its genre was its poetic character involvement. We cared deeply for Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien, for their values, and for their quest for the green destiny. Lee does the same for HULK. In exposing its characters to danger, he wishes to reveal the gravity of their situations. Hardly ever does anyone utter a mutter a snappy line, emote a mushy sentiment, or deliver a cliché expression.

Compare Bruce Banner's discovery of his newfound abilities with Peter Parker's (of SPIDER-MAN). He reacts with deep fear and confusion, whereas Parker reacts with excitement and exhilaration. The latter may be more amiable for audiences, but if I found out that I was growing microscopic claws on my fingertips and spewing webbing from my wrists, I'd be freaking out. Spider-Man has the comfort of shooting off a few quips along with his webs as he confronts his foes. Banner, along with other characters in HULK have no such luxury. The movie is not without joy though. It has several humorous moments, none of them in a light-hearted sense though.

It should be said that this picture was blessed with a great cast. Eric Bana (BLACK HAWK DOWN & CHOPPER), who has star written all over him, conveys inner turmoil-slash-solidity very effectively as Bruce Banner. The ever-beautiful Jennifer Connelly reprises her wife-of-a-brilliant-but-mentally-unstable-scientist role from A BEAUTIFUL MIND as Betty Ross. I thought her main purpose was to appear as a captivating yet unreachable beauty for both Banner and the Hulk, and she serves her role perfectly. Nick Nolte has to my mind never given a bad performance, and he appears valuably scruffy and deceivingly two-faced as David Banner (he could be confused for one of the hulk-dogs). But of all of the main players, Sam Elliot (THE CONTENDER, WE WERE SOLDIERS, & THE BIG LEBOWSKI) impressed me the most with his controlled and palpable intensity as General Ross. At one point, with his glistening complexion and bulging neck veins, he looked more intimidating than the Hulk.

The movie has a lot of other assets. It has a memorable score by Danny Elfman (who also did BATMAN and SPIDER-MAN). It has beautiful cinematography by Frederick Elmes (THE ICE STORM). It has wondrous visualization by using split-screens like window panes in comic books, such as several angles in one shot, or one window opening up into another (this is the most inventive use of the technique since Brian De Palma's FEMME FATALE). It also has buried moments of lyrical dueling between different characters. When Betty Ross says, `You weren't that hard to find.' and Banner retorts `Yes I was.' that instant carried a greater emotional weight. You'll understand it once you see it.

Fans of the Hulk (like me) will be familiar with the several storylines that have been amalgamated into the screenplay, one of them being David Banner, who is Bruce's character in THE INCREDIBLE HULK TV series (speaking of which, Lou Ferrigno, who portrayed the TV Hulk, appears in a cameo with Stan Lee). The rest I leave up to the `Hulksters'. But for all the pluses that HULK has, the ones that I will take home with me are its ideas. That the Hulk is not just rage, he is pure innocence. He only smashes when provoked. He is a near mindless brute, but when calm, he is a child. He smites tanks that fire at him as a toddler would kick a toy after tripping over it.

As a character, the Hulk is the ultimate childlike id, the source of all instinctual impulses and demands for immediate satisfaction of primitive needs. As a film, THE HULK is the most introspective of the Marvel superhero movies that have come out so far. The X-MEN films have had the disadvantage of having too many characters, resulting in too many protagonists to follow. SPIDER-MAN and the BLADE movies were all about entertainment. Many comic book films barely touch on their themes, but HULK actually wants to deal with the issues it raises. No wonder I gravitate to it.",8.0,24 June 2003
Hulk Smash!,"In talking about this the latest installment of the Hulk franchise several people will mention by comparison Ang Lee's Hulk movie like a dirty handkerchief thats fallen out of their back pocket, but personally I got a great deal of satisfaction from it; though not what I thought it was going to be the choice was to focus on human character, bonds of love, and a father son relationship I had until this point not been aware of. This Hulk film on the other hand is exactly what I expected and further more what I wanted; I wanted it to be what it is a hard hitting, guns (big forearms) blazing, popcorn flick for turning the brain switch to off and kick back. Take that stance and I think you'll all find something worth while here and a little more perhaps as well.",7.0,7 July 2008
What a waste of time...,"I didn't have high expectations for this movie. As a regular movie-go-er, I usually like most movies I watch. Granted, I see enough that more than a handful aren't decent, and I've had some arguments with friends about how good movies were (yes, I like b-movies, so sue me.) With this said, I approached the Hulk expecting a fun, interesting movie, not necessarily good, but at least entertaining, within the realm of the rest of the super-hero movies that have come out lately, with much success.

Boy was I wrong. This was the first movie in a long while that bored me, and the first movie I can remember that actually made me want my money back. I thought the CGI would be the worst thing about this movie, but it was the best, and it wasn't all that great. Oh, I'm wrong... Sam Elliot was good, it was nice to see him in a ""block-buster"" picture, and Jennifer Connelly put in a good performance, but the rest of the movie was crap. How they got once superb actor Nick Nolte to play such an awful part is beyond me. The editing was atrocious, among the worst I've ever seen. The editor couldn't figure out how he wanted to get from one scene to the next. Wipes, dissolves, cuts were all used, and for a while it was more entertaining to count the number of different methods used than to actually watch the movie. But only for so long, because after a while you can't remember if you were on #63 or #72. The soundtrack was bland, not even coming close to the excellence achieved in Daredevil.

Don't bother wasting your time with this movie. If you must see it, wait till it's out on video, and see if you can con a friend into renting it, so you don't have to waste your money on it.",1.0,25 June 2003
sucked!,This movie was so boring I couldn't keep my eyes open. Literally! I fell asleep for a half an hour. There was so much detail into the story that it just got dull. If it's gonna be an action movie it needs a little more action than that. It sucked!,,7 July 2003
A Comic Book film with more brains than brawn.,"It's been a while since i saw this film, way back when it first came out. I'm sure if i see it now my opinion might change. But two years isn't that long so i think i'll invest in this review.

First off, marketing killed this film. I guess it was inevitable since how can you herald the big screen translation of the big green smashing machine without annunciating the action, which this film does have. But people missed a far bigger point integral to enjoying this film. The hulk is not a hero. He's more like marvel's King Kong, a magnificent beast that's misunderstood and taken advantage of by mankind. He's also the enraged alter ego of Bruce Banner, a nuclear scientist with a traumatised past dominated by his father who past on mutated genes to his son after an illegal experiment conducted by himself on himself. He murdered his wife (I think) and since then disappeared, until now, working as a janitor in Bruce's institute. Bruce gets exposed to a heavy dose of radiation after some gutsy heroics to save his comrade after an experiment goes wrong. The radiation has now triggered the mutated gene, causing him to turn a bit green when angry. Now the army want's him for his unique genes, as the hulk goes on the rampage.

It's Bruce's troubled past and his relationship with his father that really puts oomph to the drama here, and sets up a truly harrowing final battle at the climax, which i'll leave you to enjoy. The rest of the film works too, with great special effects, good acting and action sequences. People have really been unfair to this movie's look, especially the hulk. I think he was great, considering the alternatives. Are there any? Guy in suit; limited mobility. Animatronics; yeah right! And we can't complain since who's really supposed to know what a super-sized green man beast is supposed to look like? I think this is the best hulk they could have possibly made and while not perfect (special effects almost never are), it was good enough for me. Spider-Man had the same problems, but people got through that.

I also loved the film's comic book panel split screen work, which really made the scenes far more dynamic and allows you to see a scene from multiple perspectives.

This film only has a handful of action set pieces, but all are fantastic and well paced. CGI fight scenes are usually a bit too synthetic, but they do good here, and since anger's the motivation it makes them that much more enjoyable.

There are flaws however. Eric Bana is good as the mentally restrained Bruce, but seems a bit too suppressed and doesn't always succeed in selling the scenes. The first transformation into the hulk was supposed to look quite ominous and confused with it's dark setting, reflecting Bruce's confusion, but you see too much of him, which kinda makes it less ominous. But the next transformation makes up for it though, which becomes the first time you see the transformation properly. Finally there's a truly confused section just before the final fight, and just after the previous action set piece before it. It just stops the film in it's tracks for around 10 minutes, making me think it was going to end it was so solemn. I was prepared to be really disappointed, wanting the hulk to come back once again, or for at least some of the film's plot line to be resolved. This all came true in the end, but this section made it so inconsistent. But it did end well in the end though, so i looked past it.

An underrated film that deserves a look from anyone who can keep an open mind. Hold your expectations back, just go with the flow. You might be pleasantly surprised.

The film's poor box office success shouldn't retract from a more action packed sequel. It needs and deserves one. Don't't let us down universal!",6.0,23 June 2005
Not As Bad As It Seems,"The Hulk was very entertaining to me from the action down to the love interest. It was amazing to see how a so called ""beast"" could connect with a human, and for that human to stay calm throughout the whole ordeal. The movie did perfectly fine with me, and I enjoyed watching Bruce's journey. So many people tried to bring the Hulk down, but he prevailed through it all. Bruce's love for Betty was so strong that he transformed back into human form for her. Overall I believe that no one should hesitate to see the movie, because it is engaging. This film is not just for the kids, it is for everyone of every age, not to mention that it incorporates love into the combination.",7.0,15 October 2008

Terribly Disappointing,"In going to see the Hulk I was expecting something in the style of Spider-Man, with fancy special effects, a good story line and some nice touches. The only thing that the Hulk had was good special effects. The story line was predictable and static, with very little intrigue and interest. The film mainly focuses around the Hulk (obviously) and his rage. His father genetically engineered himself and passed on the traits to his son. In the present day his son is working in a biotech lab when he is exposed to a great deal of gamma radiation. For some miraculous reason he is still alive. After this the film plummets quickly. For some unexplained reason the radiation 'triggered' the genetic engineering that was previously present inside him. Because of this he became a mutant. Whenever he became enraged at something he would transform into the Hulk and go around destroying things. The computer generated animations of the Hulk were quite impressive, detailing his face and body very well. After destroying things for a while the army gets on his back and decides that with a few bombs he'll be dead and the world will be saved. Not really. The more they shoot at him the more his rage fuels him and they go on a long and pointless journey around the country blowing things up. There is no balance between feelings in the film, each scene is either very explosive and rather over the top, or it is boring and overly drawn out. <---Spoils Ending After this Point---> The ending comes over incredibly strangely. We find the Hulk battling his newly mutated father on the shore of a lake. His father turns into whatever he touches so the Hulk ends up fighting a stone monster, a water demon etc. etc, but then the army decides to nuke them both. The camera zooms out, and a plane flies in and nukes the lake that they are fighting in. The screen then becomes a flurry of motion and green swirls while faces and memories fly past after a few intensely boring minutes of this the screen changes to some unimportant things, and then they show the main character living in South America selling something to the natives, who try to steal something and he says ""You don't want to see me angry."" A pathetic attempt at a twist on the ending. Another gripe that I had about The Hulk is the editing. The transitions from scene to scene are done using outlined boxes containing parts of the movie gliding around the screen. Sometimes the screen has three or four angles of the scene that is happening, which gets very hard to watch, trying to decide which small section of the screen yields the best view of what is happening. When you find out that none of the angles offered are very good shots of the action then the scene changes and some other strange transition comes into play. It is nice to see people trying something new for a change, but this is not a good example of great editing. It is distracting and detracts from the movie, but maybe thats a good thing when you see how good the film itself is.",1.0,7 July 2003

A Great Adult-Comic Movie!!!,"22 June 2003. I really didn't want to go to see The Hulk. The trailers made the bulging looking monster look childish and absurd. But by the time I left the theater, I had great respect for the director Ang Lee for putting the entire comic genre onto a solid adult footing. This comic movie isn't for children especially but more directed towards the adult themes of relationships, science gone awry, about sharp drama with character development and the hidden demons that hide within us. While there were slow, perhaps, even boring moments in the early going, such concerns may have been the change in expectations in the movie.

Ang Lee has made a great comic book movie for adults. Like Daredevil, this whole genre has merged with a larger fan base and made it into a serious industry with wide-open possibilities much like 2001: A Space Odyssey did for science fiction. While this movie will definitely rise to the level of Finding Nemo in breaking box office receipts because of its more limited attraction, especially children offending, The Hulk will have broken new ground and make a decent enough profit to justify further exploration into this rich comic genre.",8.0,25 January 2019
"'Hulk' is fine, but his life story is unnecessary","From the imagination of director Ang Lee comes a vision of epic proportions. However, that vision is unnecessary when talking about a film like The Hulk. His vision is to illustrate vividly why Bruce Banner is who he becomes and how the curse of turning into a 15 ft monster haunts him evermore. Ang Lee is able to do this rather successfully in The Hulk. However, in this type of film, audiences are looking to see more of The Hulk and want less of what appears on screen in this film. Audiences crave for less dialogue and more action which was the main problem with this film. When The Hulk appeared on screen, the film became a visual spectacle of magnificence and beauty. However, the film takes too much time to explain Banner's relationship with his father (elegantly portrayed by Nick Nolte) and how his actions lead Bruce into a world of fear and misfortune. Jennifer Connelly is fine as Banner's girlfriend Betty and Eric Bana is fine as Banner himself and does a great job at illustrating the fear within him. And whoever tells you that the Hulk looks fake and is portrayed as a Shrek on steroids, don't trust them. The Hulk looks amazing and much better than the one portrayed by Lou Ferrigno (plays a security guard in this film) in the 70's TV Show. Even when The Hulk is on screen, you can't see him because the scene is set in the dark. Ang Lee's vision is appreciated for this film. However, since it is a summer blockbuster, it is totally unnecessary because of the basic concept that WE WANT MORE HULK!",6.0,3 July 2003
NOTHING to do with comic-book at all!,"I thought that first Spiderman movie was bad. I thought that Fantastic Four was worse! Well, at least it wasn't an unfathomably long, catatonic snooze-fest. If loaded guns came with the price of admission, I guarantee most of the audience would have used them. They were literally falling asleep, wishing for it to be over. Or for at least SOMETHING, ANYTHING to happen.

How can The Hulk be boring? Ask Ang Lee. He's the one responsible for turning a dark and brooding comic-book into one of the biggest disappointments in a summer of big disappointments. Hell, even the TV series managed to portray Bruce (or David - the network thought Bruce sounded too 'gay') Banner as an isolated loner, who has no real place to call home, better than this.

It totally disrespects the comic-book, on which it was based, and has mangled Hulk mythology to the point where the title and movie character are the only remotely familiar things. Any fan of The Incredible Hulk will know that current story lines are highly intelligent with deep character development. Nothing of that sort is present here. This would have been bearable if the dialogue, or characters, were good and the logic behind their actions intriguing.

Eric Bana brings nothing to the title role. A better casting choice would have been Bruce Campbell, because Bana emotes zilch. Jennifer Connelly is useless. Nick Nolte isn't used enough. Sam Elliot, for once not playing a cowboy, has nothing to do, either.

From a creative point of view, Ang Lee's wretched way of cutting scenes together with split screens, in an effort to mimic the comic-book, is disorientating. It appears that in researching the film, he read a couple of Sixties issues and got inspired. This cheapens and degrades the movie and insults the current style of the comic franchise. Even the photography is dull, with no thought put into composition. In fact, the only time the camera is considered is when the colour green makes a creative appearance.

And why is it so tame? The Hulk - called Mister Angry in the movie! - spins a tank and chucks it across the desert. Anyone inside would have been crushed by the G-Force before the Hulk even let go. But what happens? The guy inside climbs out, coughs and wipes the dust off! What is this? The A-Team? This would never have happened in the comic-book. It gets even worse when Apache helicopters crash into the Grand Canyon without blowing up.

Oh, and since when did the the green guy do that leaping through the air thing? Leave The Hulk alone. He's angry. And you're not going to like him.",1.0,30 September 2006
It's like a Radiohead album!,"I can't quite believe most of the comments on here about the Hulk being dissapointing, slow, lacking cohesive direction, bad script, bad acting, over the top and whatever else certain philistines have said.

Dispell any notion of what you think you are going to see. Yes, the trailer did luck a bit naff but in the cold light of day, or the subdued lighting of a cinema, the Hulk, for me anyway, surpassed in terms of direction and screenplay other supposed films recently released like The Matrix Reloaded, and even Spiderman for that comic book comparisons that will ensue. Ang Lee's direction is flawless, the use of split screen comic book style framing, the character development is pretty good aswell, Connelly and Bana are matched perfectly. There is a sense of the melodramatic and over the top characterisation but it's a comic book adaption for crikes sake, get over yourselves already with this ridiculous analysis of how big the Hulk is and the rest of the guff spouted by people with nothing better to do than invade their own space in there Strom Trooper outfits. It harks me right off that this will be called a dissapointment when it was nothing short of genius. The Hulk itself, is a beautiful CGI creation and there are some truly drop jaw moments when it looks like a 20ft big green man is really a 20 foot big green man. The tank scene is just mind blowing and there is some incredible visual poetry in the Hulks expressions when you can see the person inside the Hulk realising himself. The film is huge in scope and Lee should be commended for his vision. The Hulk is drama first, Action second. But this is what will be it's failing amongst viewers, it will be unnecessarily compared to the big brainless blockbusters, which I'm sure is one of the reasons for LOTR being released nearer the end of the year. I have found the cinema going experience recently to be very annoying and dissapointing. The last decent film I saw was About Schmidt, though this experience was marred by stupid people discussing their weekly shopping list and dumb as you like teenagers rabbiting on about garage music. This film is sensational and I think people will realise it's potential on DVD. It's like a Radiohead album in essence, gigantic in scope, simply played out and it's true beauty realised on a second listen. See this film, see it, see it, see it. A definate 9 out of 10. Will certianly be in my Top 10 films ever. And will be one of the best you will see this year.",,15 July 2003
Lou Ferrigno cameo! Ready for Hulk 2.,"I so waited anxiously for this HULK film since I heard about it a year ago. Well, it took a whole hour just for story telling. Slow-moving and boring. Jennifer Connelly wasn't interesting to me. All the actors looked pale. The color of the film look faded. But the most exciting of the film is the CGI HULK in raging action. However some scenes go so fast you don't get to absorb every frame. Nighttime scenes and underwater scenes are too dark to see what is going on. That's a waste of CGI. The HULK is only seen for a total of 20 to 30 minutes total. Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno are in a cameo appearance. It would have been nice to have given Mr. Ferrigno a funny bit to do that would have reminded us of his HULK days. This film is nothing like ""The Incredible Hulk"" tv series (1978-1982) that starred Bill Bixby (may he rest in peace) and Lou Ferrigno. The tv series had emotion. I enjoyed the ending of this HULK film with the hope that there will be a HULK 2. Now that the storytelling is out of the way we can move on to more action in HULK 2. As Lou Ferrigno would probably agree with: Give the Hulk more screen time.",7.0,9 July 2003
"I admire the style of the movie, but it moved way too slow","My Rating: **1/2

When I saw The Hulk, I really thought I would get another comic book action movie. But I didn't, I got a really stylish comic book movie. It is a movie I would be able to admire and enjoy, but unfortunately the movie had a really sluggish pace in areas. That is why my rating of The Hulk is not higher.

The Hulk is better acted than most comic book movies. Eric Bana was good as Bruce Banner. Jennifer Connely was also good as Betty Ross, Banners love interest. However, Nick Nolte is the best and worth seeing the movie alone for, he plays the crazy father (of bruce) extremely well.

The Hulk's special effects are not as bad as I thought they would be. They do look downright cheesy in the desert and a lab but the scenes in San Francisco, the Dog Fight and at the end are very well done. The movie does have some memorable scenes.

Director Ang Lee used the Split-Screen Technique to make the Hulk look like a page of a comic book. It works really well. Although there was one point where it may have been overdone but for the most part it worked very well. This will separate The Hulk from the rest of the comic book movies.

The problem with the movie as it says in the first paragraph is the sluggish pace. Some of the action scenes even get a little boring, especially the ones in the desert. Its true The Hulk is a more complex story to tell than say, Spiderman. But it was impossible for me to give it a higher rating because it was just so sluggish that at one point I wanted to go to the bathroom so maybe when I come back it would move FASTER.

Alll this said, The Hulk does have admirable qualities like I mentioned. Maybe I will watch it again on DVD. It might be possible I wasnt in the mood for it.",6.0,5 September 2003
"Bad acting, a poor script, and a mostly boring 2+ hours","This is one of several Marvel Comics adaptations of this decade, and one that I went to see while it was in theatres. Previously, I had gone to see ""Spider-Man"" and ""X2"", both of which are good, in my opinion, but when I went to see ""Hulk"", I was bored as I sat in the theatre, and didn't feel so great after I left. It has been four years since then, but I have just given it another try. When I saw it in the theatre, it probably didn't help that I was really thirsty. This time, however, I wasn't, and I was still displeased.

In 1966, a scientist named David Banner, who specializes in genetics, becomes the father of a boy named Bruce. When Bruce is only four years old, his father's research is cancelled, which causes the man to go insane, leading to the death of his wife! David Banner is locked up because of this, and Bruce is adopted. After Bruce grows up, he becomes a scientist, and works with his friend, Betty. He is still haunted in his dreams by the repressed memories of his childhood! In a lab accident, he is exposed to gamma radiation, but mysteriously survives! After this, whenever Banner gets angry, he turns into a dangerous green hulk! This may put many people in danger, and General Ross, Betty's father, threatens to lock Bruce up!

These Marvel Comics adaptations aren't usually perfect, if they ever are, but I've been impressed with most of the ones I've seen. However, ""Hulk"" is an exception, as it just fails miserably in too many ways. The acting is pretty bad, and the poor script doesn't help, with some laughable lines. Those aren't the only problems, unfortunately. Talbot is often a rather annoying character, and it seems that he's just nasty for the sake of it. In some parts of the film, several different scenes are shown at the same time, on different parts of the screen, which looks a tad silly. The mutated dog fighting scene is ridiculously long, and there may be other scenes that are the same. The film is very dark, and it seems that it's meant to be gripping, but probably due to all the shortcomings, it didn't give me any strong feelings.

Sometimes, one can dislike a movie when they first see it, but then it improves with later viewings, but I think my last viewing of ""Hulk"" confirms that I never will like it. Bringing comic book characters to live action movies isn't a bad idea in my book, as I have seen it done well in a good number of films. So, this movie had potential, but unlike many other movies based on Marvel Comics characters, this one did not reach any of it. Since I've never been too familiar with the ""Incredible Hulk"" comic book series, I don't know what hardcore fans would think of this adaptation, but for casual fans of these comic book movies, you might be better off skipping this one.",4.0,14 October 2007
"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly","This movie is one of my biggest Guilty Pleasure Films, I have watched this movie more than any other superhero film.

But I love the character study of Bruce Banner in this film, this is not as much of a action movie than it is a drama and thriller.

Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) becomes the much loved green super hero in the action blockbuster The Hulk,"This film has everything, from excellent character development and interaction to heart-pumping, Hulk smashing, good old fashion action. Ang Lee does a masterful job in lifting the characters in the Hulk off of the comic page. He has exquisite vision in character interactions as well as the incredible action sequences. As far as the main characters, Eric Bana has great acting talent, and he shows it. The American movie newcomer will see many great roles after this. His character analysis was excellent and his choices were evident. Jennifer Connelly (Betty Ross) fits her role very well as the long time friend of Bruce Banner. She gives a believable performance and connects very well with her co-star onscreen. The supporting roles were also well done. I am not much of a Nick Nolte (David Banner) fan, however he delivered a poignant performance. Sam Eliot (General Ross) made a good counterpoint to Nick Nolte as well as Connelly. With the music of Danny Elfman, the visual effects supervision of Dennis Muren, and the direction of Ang Lee, the Hulk is a can't miss heart racing blockbuster.",6.0,22 June 2003
The worst film I've seen EVER makes the 70's series look cool,"I almost fell asleep during the first 45 minutes of this waste of good celluloid, the cheesy abuse of Brian De Palma's use of split screen in his 1976 film Carrie, which was used effectively,(not that I've ever been a great fan of it) was taken to a new high presumably to distract from the lack of....of... well anything that one could consider either good cinematography or dialogue, how remarkably unlike Spiderman or the X-men, both of which I thoroughly enjoyed. Bill Bixby and Jack Colvin were far more believable in their 1977 TV series centred around childrens entertainment, I believe on a sunday afternoon on the BBC. And to think I missed a re-run of Gerry Andersons Thunderbirds to watch it. My advise don't waste your money, maybe support your local childrens or amateur theatre, I guarantee it will be more rewarding",1.0,6 July 2003
"Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" is a singular masterpiece of the super-hero genre","I know the current ""Avengers"" movies are popular right now, and everybody digs Mark Ruffalo's version of the Hulk (myself included), I still consider Ang Lee's 2003 ""Hulk"" to be one of the finest comic book based movies ever, and contrary to popular belief, one of the most faithful. Being a true fan of the Hulk comic stories from the 60's to the 80's, I think I can say this with credibility. I'm also coming from the angle that the 70's TV show is not the real Hulk.

First, Ang Lee's film is extremely faithful to the comics. Watching the movie, it was as if some scenes were lifted right out of the Stan Lee stories. Hulk fighting army tanks in the desert, Hulk leaping over canyon cliffs, Hulk touching the reaches of space, and yes, even Hulk dogs are from the comics. Hulk's father in the movie is directly based on Bruce's father in the comics, Brian Banner, who was abusive and allegedly had a hand in Hulk's origin. The many villain incarnations that David Banner takes on at the end of the film are not just the Absorbing Man, but are an amalgam of many of Hulk villains including Zzax.

Second, Ang Lee's film was less about simply ""Hulk Smash"" and more about the idea of the Hulk. The idea of evolution, the idea of repression and subsequent freedom from that repression. It's interesting that every Ang Lee film is similarly about this idea of repression. Repressed gay cowboys, repressed women in China, a repressed slave finding freedom after the Civil War, etc. The evolution idea is expressed in the food chain of ""Hulk"" creatures we see in the movie. First a frog, then dogs, Hulk himself, and then a near ""Hulk god"" in David Banner. Evolution is also cinematically expressed in the morph edits seen throughout the film. Contrary to popular belief, the multi-frame editing was not just about mimicking a a comic book, it was about expressing the idea of freedom from repression, of seeing something from different angles, different points of view, different sides, much like Bruce has a ""different side"" to him. If you notice, the multi-angles many times show us the same subject but from a different camera angle. The idea of the Hulk is also metaphorically visually expressed through the imagery of atomic mushroom clouds and jellyfish, two visually similar objects. It expresses the idea that this Hulk was born of two of the greatest known forces in the universe, genetic and atomic force.

It's Ang Lee's masterful filmmaking, strong use of visual metaphor, and faithfulness to the original comics that really sets his Hulk film apart for me. Perhaps the one scene that really spells out what Ang Lee is doing and also brought me back to the old comics was that first close-up we see of Hulk free and jumping through the desert to the haunting Danny Elfman music. Classic.",10.0,29 June 2012
It was okay.,"Ang Lee's vision for the comic book adaptation translates well on screen, adding to the overall satisfaction - with the cheesy effects of putting the comic into the film. Jennifer Connelly's performance is captivating and adds to the film's appeal. Nick Nolte is perfect for his role, and it feels like he was let loose on screen, just like the character's moments needed. However, the lead role falls short, as Eric Bana fails to bring the necessary charisma to his portrayal of Banner. Although the Hulk is great and the action is believable, Bana's portrayal of Banner comes off as creepy and unconvincing. It's unfortunate that audiences hate this film, but I will become angry if you don't appreciate the excellence in it.",7.0,12 November 2023
It was so stupid-really really bad!,"We saw it on DVD and even though it was a perfect picture, it was a terrible movie. Very slow moving and story lines were not connected very well or not at all! So glad I didn't pay top movie theater dollar to see it. Ooooh can't wait for the sequel;)

Nick Nolte must have been really hard up to want to take this role. Not only was it not like what we remember from the TV series, it took on a totally different genre. Let's call it sci-stupid.

Maybe the director took a nap while this was filming. It's the only way I can see how this even got through the editing department. Lots of holes and confusing turns in the script that you get really lost in the story and are not sure what is going on with Betty & Bruce. Also the same thing with his relationship with his father and we never really understand what happened to his mother and for what reason. I was also confused with Betty's father.....sometimes he's a mean dude and then you think he's OK but then he's a jerk again.

It was too long of a movie and it took way too much time trying to paint the base coat. From then on it tried fiercely to not go under....very very bad movie!",2.0,20 February 2005
I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't convinced either,"Bruce is a promising scientist who is haunted by suppressed memories that half come to him as nightmares. He works in a lab experimenting with a method for repairing wounds, however, when a part of the equipment malfunctions, Bruce places himself in the path of a blast of gamma radiation in order to save a colleague. Although he should have died, Bruce survives and feels better than ever, but something inside him has been unlocked. A man claiming to be his father tries to harness this power whilst shedding light on Bruce's past, but the anger inside Bruce is becoming increasingly uncontrollable.

I'm not a big comic book fan, but I have been taken by the recent run of enjoyable screen versions of characters. To be honest the Hulk has never struck me as a particularly interesting character and I wasn't overly bothered about seeing this film. My wife and I went to see it last week and I came out with mixed views  indifferent, if you will. The film is a strange mix of art-house pretensions and blockbuster. I could see where Lee was coming from as Hulk is one of the most tragic comic book heroes as his power is really a curse rather than a blessing, but his attempts to dig deep into the darkness doesn't really work in this type of film and only succeeds in coming off as a little dull.

The first hour of the film is a little wordy as a result but I still found it interesting as I did appreciate a blockbuster for trying to do something more interesting. In stark contrast the scenes with Hulk are exciting and enjoyable. It may be a little lax for those hoping for big spectacle but I enjoyed them. The Hulk himself is a good special effect, but never more than a special effect. In his action mode he is good, but expected to work close up as a character he is woeful. He can't bring out emotion and he actually looks a little daft, I know that technically he is amazing but to be honest it's whether he works onscreen or not is what matters to me and, for what they needed him to do, he doesn't.

The end of the film is a real messy affair with things with Bruce's father, big mushroom things and trippy images that aren't ever really explained. Up till this point the two aspects of the film (Bruce's past and the action) had been pretty clear  but at this point any sense of logic goes out the window.

The cast are a mixed bunch. Bana has clearly been directed to be `bottled up' but it is to the film's detriment as he is too dull to carry the lead. Connelly is a little better as she manages to carry weight without sounding like she's reading words from the bible (which Bana does occasionally). Nolte is good value (until the end) as he hams it up enjoyably and is able to take some of the unworthy seriousness out of the film. Elliott, like Connelly, has a good character and adds gravitas without overdoing it or making it seem forced.

Overall I wasn't totally disappointed with this film, but I wasn't impressed either. I could see what Lee was getting at but it simply doesn't work. His direction (comic book style split screen) is good in terms of reminding us where the material came from, but it's main function is to distract from the potential boredom of some scenes. The ending leaves the suggestion of a sequel which I suspect will never come.",,27 July 2003
"Not incredible, but I appreciate it now.","This is a different sort of a superhero movie. When I first saw this movie as a kid, I thought it was just a boring movie in general. Watching it now, I actually have some appreciation when it came to Ang Lee's direction with this. I could tell he put a lot of his effort into this project and his visuals was artistically crafted into this. However despite the comic book like format and editing during certain scenes, this just didn't seem all that much like a comic book movie. Which is probably what majority of the audiences was looking forward to when buying tickets in theaters. I could tell Ang Lee wanted to put effort into making a story driven movie with emotions. Which I do appreciate during certain parts, but it does feel and seem a bit drawn out from time to time as well even if certain transitions is good. Despite the Hulk looking like some clay monster, the mass power, carnage and destruction is actually well done and entertaining. Especially the highlight scene of Hulk running from the military and fighting them off. I don't know about Eric Bana playing Bruce Banner, he just didn't seem like Bruce Banner. However Jennifer Conelly and Nick Nolte (even if there isn't really much for him to work with as a villain) really worked with their roles. Jennifer Conelly is just plain downright super pretty in this and made even the drawn out scenes watchable. Overall this is a Hulk movie that I appreciate, but wasn't really all that entertained with.

Was Nick Nolte's character even given a name? It was doomed from the beginning. There haven't been any that were even passable as a good movie. The writers (Schamus, Turman, and France) didn't seem to have even picked up any of the comic books in their research. The movie did have very good camera work though.

One of the problems was that it took 41 minutes for our hero, ""The Hulk,"" to show up! Hey, for a cartoon-as-a-movie, that's too long for the audience to wait. Don't get me wrong: I don't want one of these brainless nonstop action movies, but this was a tad too much in other direction. It needed just a little more spark to keep the young audience, which it should have known was going to watch this.

For adults with a brain, it also needed to offer us something other than the Hollywood cliché villain - the military. Puh-leeze....how much longer with these liberal loonies keep bashing the military? This has been going on since the '60s and ""Dr. Strangelove"" and its getting worse over the years. Now our comic book heroes have become left wing revolutionaries, too? Give it a rest, or should I say, ""move on?""

"One of the few comic book adaptations grounded on the theme of mood over action; pros to serious movie-goers, cons to others","Ang Lee's filmed version of The Hulk, unfortunately, won't appeal to all those within the mainstream spectrum of movie-goers. I can guess (hearing from a few of my friends who are true-blue comic book addicts)fans of the comic will be pleased, however those who may not be fans or admirers and are simply looking for the kind of non-stop action and campy, tongue-in-cheek humor of Spiderman may be disappointed. Ang Lee has taken Stan Lee's vision of the ultimate perturbed anti-hero and created a work that can appeal to viewers with an darker art-house sensibility as well as viewers with a thirst for action-adventure blockbusters.

In a sense this is similar to the approach Tim Burton used for Batman fourteen years ago, though his was given a shot of adrenaline and hilarity from Jack Nicholson as The Joker. The Hulk doesn't really have any overtly flamboyant characters like that to chew on the scenes they steal, so rather Lee looks at its core as a story of parents (notably fathers) and their children. Children who are tainted from missing and shattered childhoods from their before they can completely remember. Sam Elliot's Solider and Nick Nolte's Cast-out Father, perhaps, are the most important characters of the film after the protagonist Bruce Banner, as that they set the Jekyll and Hyde-esquire story in motion and carry/deliver much of the emotional weight that follows.

Eric Bana is scientist Bruce Banner, un-wittingly following in his father's combustible career, who wants to use gamma-radiation to help out frogs in studies, and unfortunately gets caught in an accident of catastrophic proportions. There is, he finds out, something inside of him, ever since he was a child, that gets released into the open by the radiation, and the monster within becomes an unstoppable freak of nature. The gorgeous Jennifer Connelly plays his once love interest and only true friend, Betty Ross, who gets caught in a crossroads after her father, a military man who put away Banner's father away thirty years earlier, gets involved in the pursuit.

It isn't just Lee's interest in getting to know who these characters ARE that makes the film fascinating, but in his stylizing of the medium- he has split screens in moments we'd never expect that give the film a comic-book edge, just how when reading one we may look at two or three of the pictures at once for it to sink in. His use of close-ups creates an intensity in seeing and getting to know these people. Rarely in a superhero movie does one look so intently at the eyes.

A major drawback, I felt, were the action set pieces. They were certainly above the texture of the Spiderman scenes, yet the Hulk never looks truly real enough to commit total sympathy or other emotional connection to him. The fight scene with three dogs is one of the best fights of the summer, and a climax with Banner and his father is a near powerhouse, but the climax just before it goes on for far longer than it should. But, I suppose that notion could be considered Sour Grapes since I've never read a Hulk comic and only seen snippets of the old TV show.

By the end of this character-driven roller coaster, I knew I had seen a well made comic-book adaptation, better than most I've seen in recent memory. But I wanted more, or perhaps less, than what I was given. Notle, by the way, has crazy Oscar-calibert-meets-campy work here, as does the editing by Tim Squyres.",8.0,24 July 2003

"Great film, bogged down by boring, straight-forward people.","It's a slow-paced story, that tries to make it as realistic as it can, in order to make it a little more believable that somebody can be like this, as well as showcase what they'd go through. As a comic fan, it makes sense to me that Bruce is so numb to what's happening. It was something deep down; repressed. It was always there. It just had no way to come out.

The CGI, not only amazing for its time, is still awesome to this day. Actually better than plenty of new movies, that funnel millions more into their projects. Only thing that didn't look great was the villain. Yet the physical effects, when he's shown, are still top notch.

If you're a patient person, who actually enjoys movies that aren't typical, you'll enjoy this. It's not a copy and paste superhero film, though I enjoy those too. It tries to add drama, action, and mystery, and does it all well. Really, my only complaint would be the script can seem like a 2000's movie sometimes, and sometimes the acting seems that way too. And it could've delved a little bit more into Bruce's confusion about what he's become. Other than that, always worth a watch.

Interesting interpretation,"Hulk is a flawed but very interesting interpretation of the much loved comic book character that's undermined by inconsistent CG, a languid pace and an overblown finale. However, it also has more than enough visual style, plenty of drama and surprising thematic depth.

Despite sometimes being drowned out by the CG alter ego for large sections, Eric Bana gives a great lead performance, imbuing the character with a genuine pain and visceral anger that makes the transformations into the Hulk believable.

Jennifer Connelly adds a lot of humanity and really sells the relationship between Betty and Bruce. Sam Elliott plays completely to his commanding strengths and Nick Nolte is a solid villain with substantial depth and a mostly understated performance that works.

Ang Lee's direction mostly works. The comic book style panels and transitions really help to counterbalance the slow pace but can be a little distracting in the more emotional moments.

The acting was OK. I was neither offended nor delighted by any of the performances. If I had to guess, I'd say the reason there was no sequel is that none of the actors were interested enough to do it.

And that brings me to the split screen shenanigans. Totally distracting and pointless. Why exactly did we need to see helicopters from 6 different angles?

Could've been better,"Why is it that a production company will sink millions of dollars into a film and then overlook the little things to allow a movie to fall far short of its potential.

I was eagerly awaiting The Hulk, but I was very disappointed. While Ang Lee had directed decent films like Sense and Sensibility and Crouching Tiger, I have a hard time believing this is the same guy directing the Hulk. I have 3 general complaints about the film:

1) The constant and way-too-frequent split-screen panels are incredibly distracting to the story. Anyone who has studied film knows that effects like split screen are cool once but annoying if you use them every 5 minutes.

2) The story took way too long to develop. This is the same problem Pearl Harbor had. There is no reason to wait 40-45 minutes to get anything to happen in this type of film. I am pretty sure their target market for this film is kids, teens and/or early 20's, but there were kids talking in the theater after about 20 minutes. You think that they would have test screened the film and noticed that the movie is boring... EVEN FOR KIDS!

3) The acting wasn't very good. Nick Nolte, Sam Elliott and Jennifer Connely have all had better gigs. This goes back to the directing problem. The film didn't make me really care one way or the other about Bruce Banner or the films ""plot"". More importantly, why didn't they cast someone who could act to be Bruce Banner. I've seen Eric Bana in other things but he never seems natural. He always seems like an actor trying to act a scene rather than a character in the film.

The film had one redeeming quality: the CGI Hulk was very good.

I am not against films in this genre. I loved X1, X2, and Spiderman. In this case, the Hulk is a film I wish I had waited to see after the DVD was released. I feel cheated that I paid 8 bucks a pop to see this half assed movie.",1.0,23 June 2003
This movie had sooo much potential so I don't understand why this movie was such a disappointment,"The Incredible Hulk is such an incredible story. I don't understand why this movie was such a disappointment!! This movie was very long and you get to see The Hulk in action for about 30-40 minutes out of like 2 hours!!! Plus the story was sooo bad!! This movie however had an incredible cast crew and the visuals, although short, were amazing. If only they made the story to fit the story in the comics and had more of the Hulk in action, i would have enjoyed this movie a whole lot more. TRUST ME ON MOVIES!!!! I SAY THIS IN ALL MY COMMENTS BECAUSE ITS TRUE!! YOU WILL AGRREE WITH MY COMMENTS AFTER YOU WATCH THE MOVIES I COMMENTED!!! TRUST ME ON MOVIES!!! ESPECIALLY COMIC BASED MOVIES!!!

Awesome one my favs. Ang Lee Did a great job,Never understood why this film has such low ratings if I never saw this movie. And just read the ratings I would probably skip it.

Good adaptation of the comic series that does too much too soon,"Good adaptation of the comic series that does too much too soon, and put too much of a story to make anyone feel turn off. . Eric Bana makes a fine Bruce Banner And Jennifer Connelly makes a fine Betty but the movie does too much too soon with its plot and its characters. There is enough plot in here to make three movies, and not enough of the Hulk himself. This is one of those rare occasions that a sequel would be necessary because it at the very least a sequel would have continue the story and make the plot progression much better than having one movie that puts too much in the story too soon.",6.0,2 November 2003
Could Have Been So Much More.....,"When coming out of this movie, I had a strange sense of impatiality as to what I'd just seen. For me it's a definate mixed bag. Plus points are:- 1) Ang Less direction - excellent as ever,and as covered in other posts, the inventive editing, multiple angle shots, fades, wipes etc capture the comic book essence of the movie perfectly. 2) The HULK - Most of the time the Hulk looks fantastic. Certain scenes really made the character look as lifelike as I could have hoped. 3) The Acting. Bana, Connely, Nolte and the supporting cast do a more than adequate job here.

Unfortunately, the Bad points ultimately let this film down badly for me. 1) The pacing - far too slow for the majority of the first half of the movie. Sure character development is important, but not at the expense of dargging down the pacing of the entire movie, surely? Far too often (at least for a big summer action\drama movie), you're feeling the movie d-r-a-g real bad, and are waiting for something to grab your attention. 2) The HULK - Bit of a contradiction to my comments above I know, but generally while the CGI HULK looks fantastic, this is let down by the odd scenes where he stinks - and stinks real bad. The ""Foam Trap"" scene in particular, had me scratching my head (after I had been initially very impressed with the look of the character). The Ending - Over ambitious and completely unneccesary - the last half hour of the film should have been cut, and some of the effects work here is especially far from good - the huge ""bubble of energy"" anyone? 3) Hulk Jumping huge distances looked as ridiculous as it possibly could, and the part where he ""buries"" underground from the river was just plain dumb - both of these points were unnessarry character abilities for me, and just didn't translate onto the big screen.

So a straight 5\10 for me - solely for the personal plus points raised above. Ultimately dissapointing though - I've just canceled my pre-ordered HULK DVD after viewing this at the cinema, which I guess says it all.",5.0,20 July 2003
UNDERATED !!!!!!,"Brilliant origin, music and I love the fact they've edited A lot of moment to contribute to the comics. The relation
ship between Bruce and his father is fantastic/×÷÷ script as well and
CGI ahead of its time____ Dark 😭😭😭😭😭",,3 July 2019
Solid effort,"I really wanted to like the Hulk going in to see the movie and I did. I thought the acting was great, the story was pretty good and the CGI was decent. Eric Bana played Brue Banner perfectly. I look forward to the sequel and hope to see him in a lab trying to come up with a way to ""cure"" himself. My favorite part of the movie was a scene that had the Hulk and Brue Banner on screen at the same time. The battle with the military was sweet!

I could have done without the very end of the movie that dealt with Bruce and his father. It just didn't click with me for some reason. Some of the split screen stuff was really good and some of it I could have done without.

The CGI was much better than I was expecting. Don't let the bad commercials sway you on this. With that being said, it is very apparent that ILM is no longer the best FX company on the block any more. Gollum from Lord of the Rings was done much better.

Now to respond to some things I've read in other reviews. This movie does have a couple of funny moments in it. It is not as dark as everyone is saying. I did not find the first hour boring at all. It seems to me that people are forgetting comic books do have dialogue in them. I did not find the opening hour too ""talky"" at all. Also I don't see how people are saying this movie is a ""box office bomb"" since it ONLY made 62 million. It had the biggest opening in history for a June release. Also please remember not all comic books are campy, ""funny books"". Some books actually tackle real issue, dark or otherwise, so it would be unfair to say ""Why was Ang Lee trying to make a film about a comic book ""deep""?"".

This movie is not for everyone. There will be comic fans who love it, like it (like me), think it is just ok or who will hate it. There will also be non comic fans who will feel the same way. I will say this is as close to a comic book being on screen as we've had visually and structure wise. Let's just hope they take a step further with the sequel.",7.0,23 June 2003
Better Than I Thought It Would Be,"Well since this movie was called ""The Hulk"" I kind of expected it to be sort of stupid. But surprisingly it wasn't really all that bad.

As far as story and plot and special effects it was pretty good. The only problem I had with it was the way that the talking scenes were quiet and the scary or fighting scenes were way louder.

Oh and the stupid scene at the end, which you will have to see to understand, was stupid. I don't really go for those fights in the clouds, sort of thing.

It had some neat special effects though and some ""Green Giant"" type tricks that were fun to watch. I liked Jennifer Connely & Eric Bana, they had some good chemistry. It really had a comic book feel to it too, which was kind of fun.

Eric Bana has really dark eyes so it was fun watching them turn green. And of course Jennifer Connely is incredibly beautiful and a good actress. I guess she seems like the perfect tragic mate to some crazy men, like in a beautiful mind, the hulk, requiem for a dream, etc.",6.0,14 December 2003
"Very poor film. Badly written, badly acted, underused and out of place actors, and some crazy scenes.","I'd heard bad things about this movie, but still I wanted to see it. I thought so highly of Jennifer Connelly in The House of Sand and Fog and was interested to see how she fared alongside a much talked about Eric Bana whom I'd seen in Chopper before. Plus it's Hulk by Ang Lee, that was enough to grab my interest.

What a mistake. It's a bad, bad movie. Poor Connelly merely walks around looking bemused and misused with a terribly flat, two dimensional performance while Bana is dull, fixed and very out of place, it was as though he didn't even try acting. Well done to Sam Elliott and Josh Lucas for giving it a good go, but they just can't pull away from the very poor performances of the others. Even Nick Nolte is way over the top here, and it's a comic movie, that's saying something! Performances aside, which really constitutes most of the mess, we have some ridiculous scenes for the Hulk itself. Attacked by a giant killer poodle, leaping miles in a single bound, and managing to reenter Earth's atmosphere and crash into the water without much more than a splash and a shake of the head? Okay it's Hulk and it's comic, but come on now, this is a farce.

Most of the scenes with the Hulk himself are dark, and the killer for most of the fight scenes is that it's too dark and you can't see what's going on. This is really evident when we see him fighting the killer dogs, then again with the final fight against the main creature of the movie.

The whole contrived storyline with this creature is bizarre, the fact that it takes on the shapes of things it touches and absorbs but yet only when it suits the story. When it starts changing into rocks and water showing it can't seemingly control itself is bizarre when not two minutes ago it was wearing clothes, walking around and sitting on a seat without ill affect. The whole idea of it turning into water is daft anyway, surely the Hulk would just stand there and just get wet? Again, not that you can see what's going on during these scenes.

It deserves a mark for two reasons though. One is the editing and post production work that makes a lot of the scene transitions and framing feel like a comic book, I actually quite liked that as it wasn't totally hiding from the source genre, it was embracing it and making it part of its own. The second is the work earlier on in the movie to build characters and try and focus on the inner angst of Banner, this was a good way to go but unfortunately the writing and the acting is just so two dimensional and weak that it just seems to be wasting yours and the movies time.",1.0,4 January 2006
Nice try though and Jennifer rocks!,"First of all, let me say that I am not much of a comics fan. I knew the story of Hulk but not the details. I wanted to see it because every now and then I like watching an action flick and, mainly, because I wanted to see what Lee would have done with a movie like this. I think the story is pretty much known to most people in here so I'll focus on the impression I was left with.

First thing that 'hit' me was the split screens thing. I have to admit that this technique gives the movie the comic book looks but in many scenes I found it irritating and confusing. I didn't know which way to look and what to pay attention to! Another thing that looked weird was... Hulk. I don't know how he looked in the comic book but in this movie he looks so...how shall I put this...he looks like these football guys in college, with lots of muscle but no brains. That, on the other hand, is exactly what makes you feel sorry for him. A different face might have given him the sense that he's too cruel too care or something like that. Thinking it again right now, I think it served its purpose. But it still looks kinda weird. The special effects were well made with many colors that, once again, gave you the feeling of actual reading a comic book. The performances were pretty good, especially Bana's. I think he was the perfect choice. Now, Connelly, once again, proves that she is a very, very good actress. Her performance was just the right one. She is not going over the top, or something. She is losing the man she loves, her father is responsible for that, but instead of screaming or yelling, she looks calm while her emotional explosions shows us how she really feels. Not to mention her beauty. (She should really keep that hair style) And we're in the final scene, the fight with Hulk's father, that just did not make any sense. The effects were all over the scene, images just kept rushing. I did not get a thing. :o(

I think Lee wanted to do so many things, thats why he shot scenes from many different angels and many times, and the split screens, that in the end he overdid it. I believe he tried to stick to the comic book looks but in a movie that is not necessarily a good thing. I can't say I did not enjoyed watching it, no, I had a great time, except some of the split screen scenes. The music was nice, and the performances too. I think I'd go with a 6.5 out of 10. But when I get to vote it has to be either a 6 or a 7, right?",6.0,17 March 2004
Horrible movie,"Well, I have now not only seen the worst of the year, but I have now seen the worst movie, I have ever seen.

HULK is one of the biggest pieces of crap ever made. I have no respect for Ang Lee, Eric Bana (not that I did before), Jennifer Connelly or Sam Elliott anymore. Well maybe I still have some respect for Elliot, becuase he's a cool guy. But still no respect for the others. Oh, and I'll throw in Nick Nolte as well.

Where to begin in the bashing of this movie? Hmmm, maybe in the extremely long and boring setup for the Hulk. No. What about the horrid acting? No. Well, then what about the bad CGI? Ah, no. Then I must start with the lowsey transitions? God, no. Then what about the comic book style editing? HA!! No!!

I'll just pick one. The performances. Wow!! Could anyone BE anymore emotionless in this movie? Bana and Connelly delivers such horrible performances. They seemed like they were just sleepwalking through the whole thing. The lines were delivered with no emotion, and everything was flat. No life. Come on people, you ever heard of pep pills?!

Now time for the CGI. Wow, if I thought the CGI in the Matrix Reloaded was pretty weak, I think I need to change my mind. Hulk has some of the worst CGI I've seen. George Lucas is gonna freak out when he sees this stuff. The Hulk-Dogs get the worst of the animation.

Now let me talk about (or rant) about the horrid transitions and comic book style editing. This movie isnt Star Wars, the wierd scene to scene transitions arent aloud in this movie, mostly becuase they dont work. Also the lousy and very stupid idea of comic book style editing was horrible. They put boxes on the screen and showed differant things going on in each box at times.

The normal public doesnt already like comic book movies, so why give them something to hate even and fall back on as evidence as to why comic book movies suck?

Superman, Batman (1989), Spider-Man and Blade are the best comic book to movie adaptations I have seen. They actually tried to look like normal movies, while also being comic book movies. Its a little hard to explain my way of thinking there, but it makes sense. I think Hulk brianed my damage.

The dialogue is horrible in this movie as well. Like this line ""Ah s**t, he has my missle."" Oh, ah, I guess thats supposed to BE funny, but... I'm not laughing. At least when Blade & Blade II writer David Goyer wrote Blade II, he made it kind of sound like a comic book, with out it sounding lame.

The movie also suffers from lame action as well. All the battle scenes and action is crap.

Now, I'm not a Hulk fan. Most all of you know I'm a Batman and Superman fan. Well I also like Blade and Spider-Man is alright, but over-rated. I dont want this to turn into a ""whos better/whos not"" arguement, but what I dont understand about the Hulk is, is he good or bad? In the movie he never actually helped anyone. All he did was destroy lots of Government property and city property. It doesnt appear to me that he is a ""super-hero"".

Like what does he do? If someone needs his help does he goto them and let them tell him the story and why they need him and then he says, hey ok, get me mad so I have a reason to stop these people. Pretty lame.

Also, if he does help people, he does a bad job. In the movie he pretty goes on a rampage of San Fransico (wheres Dirty Harry when you need him?) and he destroys lots of city property like I mentioned. Now, I figure to fix all this damage, the city of San Fransisco is going to raise taxes pretty high. So in the end, Hulk didnt save anyone, he destroyed the citizens lives, becuase the taxes are going to be raised, and some wont be able to afford where they live and they will lose their houses. Husbands will divorced and lose their children and wife. They will lose their cars and everything they worked hard for.

In the end, Hulk is a bad guy and needs to destroyed. I can understand why people want him captured. Look at what he did to their happy little lives.

Maybe I put too much thought into that, but if the movie wasnt so bad, I wouldnt have had to. Eesh.

This movie is a lousy piece of crap. Go see it if you want, but you'll be wasting your money.",2.0,17 June 2003
A Brilliantly worked film from ang lee and hulk will knock you flying,"""Hulk"" directed by ang lee is a wonderfully mastered film that decides to concentrate on the pain and anguish of bruce banner (Eric Bana. Eric is brilliant as the confused scared and sensitive scientist who darent release the hulk with in him. Connelly is the elegant lover of banner and is equally brilliant in supporting him while they both try to figure what is wrong with him.

The basic storyline is rather simple, a scientist named david banner injects a virus into his body which mutates his genes, he then realises that these mutated genes are passed onto his son. After traumatic family issues and vast exposure to gamma radiation, the hulk is leashed.

What makes this film so variably different from other comic book adaptions is that it gets straight in, none of the superficial superheros and villians. Its ang lees brilliantly created world with the outstanding hulk.

Now theres the Hulk, Ive read many user comments that naively slate the cgi of the hulk, however the cgi wasnt that terrible and the hulk was believable, however he was the star of the show, throwing tanks, jumping 200 feet, crashing helicopters hulk ran the film. Lee creates a child like monster that is brilliant on the big screen.

the downfalls are that the ending was a bit rushed and the hulk did look a little weird at points.

However this is a marvelously crafted film from one of the greatest directors, this isnt just another spin off from a good comic book idea, this is a well worked film that should be one of your must see films for the summer.

9/10",7.0,9 July 2003
"Slow and boring with terrible direction, writing and acting.","One point (pointless is closer to the truth). The simple origin story in the comic book is replaced by a long and very dull family psycho-drama dating back 30 years. It's a good 40 minutes (actually it is a very bad 40 minutes) before we get to see The Hulk, and even then the action scenes are no fun at all. The standard of the dialog in this movie is very low. It plays like Ang Lee wrote the script in Chinese and then got Google to translate it into English. The direction is appalling. Ang makes heavy handed use of split screen in an overly literal attempt to

evoke the feeling of comic book panels. What Ang should instead have

preserved was the fast pace and simplistic story lines of the original. This film desperately needs comic relief - lots of it. It takes itself so seriously you'd think this was Schindler's List, not an attempt at a Summer action movie.",1.0,23 June 2003
One of the best superhero films of all time. Extremely underrated.,"I cannot believe the constant bash this movie gets, it honesty blows my mind. Casual people that watch this movie expect it to be a 2 hour and 18 minute movie of the Hulk endlessly smashing through things and just mindless action. But really, this film is almost like an art film. The pace of the movie for me, was great, perfectly introducing the characters and the sequences. The CGI of the hulk looks incredible. Honesty give this movie a second try, you will really find it to be great.",9.0,28 April 2019
It isn't as bad as you think,"The acting was good. I had never heard of Eric Bana before, but I think he did a good job considering it was his first major starring role. Nolte, Connelly, and Elliot did their job well. (What was up with dressing Jennifer Connelly in all the baggy clothes though?!?!)

The ""fate ending"" was left to be desired (but I liked the final scene though). The Hulk looked good sometimes, sometimes not. But I expected that. I went to see the story, not the CGI.

I'm hoping though in the next movie they have more Marvel characters (Leader and Abomination) because the toys are just boring! It's just the Hulk and nothing else! At least give us 6"" Banner and Connelly figures!

Left the theater; should have done it sooner,"I'm a Hulk fan. A big Hulk fan. A disappointed Hulk fan.

This movie was terrible, and I'm not even sure I can explain how terrible in words.

Ang Lee, who put together an amazing piece in Hidden Tiger, destroyed this film. It is full of random, strange and pointless camera angles; and while the plot does flow and progress forward, it feels hideously forced and somehow disconnected.

Unless you are a rising director looking for what NOT to do, do NOT see this film.",1.0,9 August 2003
Lee's one idea that works allows him to ignore everything else that doesn't,"There ought be something wrong with the split frames, the panning cuts, the jigsaw-like dissolves and all the tricks Ang Lee uses to keep reminding us that his film was based on a comic book. Bad ideas in principle, no? This may have been a comic book once, but it's a film now; these devices make no more sense than the old Hollywood convention of opening films like ""Jane Eyre"" with a shot of a big leather book being opened to the first page.

Yet we might as well drop whatever theoretical objections we may have and admit that (Ang) Lee's comic book fixation works for the film, and works well. There's a sense that every frame and every shot neatly and gracefully interlocks with its neighbours. It suits the kind of nothing-but-the-story storytelling that Lee's aiming for and somehow suits the material as well. And, much as I was prepared to hate it, it looks great. There are not only some stunning shots in this movie but they were laid out so as to enable me to best admire them.

A pity the film doesn't get over its main hurdle: the fact that Lee is a gifted, multi-talented director capable of taking almost any subject whatever and making it insipid and boring. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""  IN PRINCPLE a thrilling, magical ride  used the beauty of its individual shots to make us pretend (it even made me pretend, for a while) that it wasn't completely unengaging and forgettable  so much tasteless rice pudding  and ""Ride with the Devil"" managed to be, not just the dullest United States Civil War film ever made, but the dullest it's POSSIBLE to make. If ""Hulk"" is a better film than either of these it's not because Lee has learned how to make scenes come to life. Performances are somehow flat and pitched poorly against one another, none of the material sings, and if Lee had any idea why all this stuff interested him he didn't succeed in conveying it to me. Much of the film is so much finger-tapping while we wait for the inevitable to happen. When the Hulk REALLY goes berserk it's obvious enough what the solution is: do nothing and wait for him to calm down. This solution not only leaps to the mind of a child of three but it's already been employed in the film by the very members of the military, boneheads though they may be, who are in charge of what to do now  so however much fun it might be to watch (FINALLY, after so much exposition!) the Hulk leap around a smash things to bits, it doesn't do much for us, knowing that we're just waiting for the characters to start doing nothing. It's not that this lapse of military intelligence is implausible, you understand. The generals did, after all, have their brains amputated years ago, when they became soldiers. But why should Lee insult us by asking us to think and feel at their level? A really skilled director, like Kubrick, would know that the way to make this extended farce exciting would be to distance us from it, to show it to us from the viewpoint of a god.

But if Lee knew how to make films exciting ""Hulk"" would be very different in many ways.

And yes, state-of-the-art CGI is still bad. We even get a shot of the Hulk's magically stretchable blue pants during a transformation scene in bright sunlight (somehow devoid of true shadows for anything computer animated), just to rub our noses in them.",,22 October 2003
"""One of The Best Superhero films of the 20th century""","Bruce Banner(Eric Banner, Troy) is one of the best actors in the business, he shows not only anger in ""The Hulk"", but sadness and kindness. Thats what I want to see, I was getting tired of mindless action in ""Matrix Reloaded"", so I saw this film and I get character development and actual acting. Nick Nolte trancended acting in the 70's and he's not at his best in this film, but he was good enough for me to dislike his character in this film. Jennifer Connelly who won an academy award for playing the same exact role in ""A Beautiful Mind"", and she's not all that great in this film, in fact she's down right annoying, but we need that kind of vulnerability in this kind of movie.

This film doesn't need dialogue like ""Spider-Man"", or ""Superman"", or even ""Batman"", it puts us in a mood that is a little depressing, and silent, like when Bruce describes what he feels when he becomes the Hulk, there's a moment of silence and no music, just the sound of his voice. ""Boom, Boom"", Thats what he says when he describes what he feels. Ang Lee is way ahead of his time, when Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" came out, people described the action and the fighting instead of the actual story, cause it's to painful to describe. One of the main, characters die in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", and Bruce Banners spirit dies, but Ang Lee keeps that depressing mood in his films, and shows the Hulk in a different way. He actualy shows him the right way, a person, not none of this Hulk smash stuff, just a person, like me and you, and other people full of anger and a bad past.

Hulk Review,"This is an anti-blockbuster. From the outside, it looks like a big cgi fest. I kind of wish it was. This is what happens when you get an art-house director to direct a comic book film. Now I love comic books (Ultimate Spider-Man is my favorite)but there needs to be some fun in them. When Ang Lee was offered this, he was probably worried that people would think he would be selling out by making a silly action film. So the film had to be made as serious and deep as possible. So he got three screenwriters to create a mess. Ang, it's the Hulk. Yes it should have some emotion, but people paid to see HULK SMASH, not hulk, let's talk about our feelings so we can control the beast inside. This has always been a hard film to watch (and this is from a guy who watched Once upon a time in the west and loved it.)",7.0,18 June 2008
It's been said already!,"Well folks,

Last night I had a special ""Invite only"" for a screening of ""HULK"" Ang Lee's new film. But, you don't need me to go on about this BRILLIANT Director whose film highlights span from Award Winning ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" in 2000 and other greats like ""Ice Storm"" and 1995's Costume Drama ""Sense and Sensibility"". We all know his work in these pictures has been flawless.

Hulk however will show audiences worldwide that EVERY Director has his day and sometimes, you'll release a film like ""Hulk"" and say to yourself ""Ow - I shelled out cash for this?"" To be fair, Ang Lee had a very ""Romantically Enchanting"" story to work with, with large plot holes in the story. So already, the sense you are watching yet another ""X Men2"" or ""Daredevil"" is thrown RIGHT Out the window.

The story is VERY Slow and for those expecting an ACTION PACKED film, forget it, this is a strangely awkward slow story of a man whose ""natural life"" is slipping away from him and those who are close to him realise this, as well as Scientist Bruce Bana played by Australian born actor Eric Bana.

Eric's performance leaves A LOT to be desired, and one strong point from his role is his capability of holding an American Accent throughout the duration of the film, which in some cases whilst watching the film the only thing from keeping me from falling asleep. Jennifer Connelly, who does look stunning in the picture provides a rather ""emotionless and directionless"" character, who seems to ""be in love"" with the Scientist in Question ""Bruce Bana"" but far to willing to hand him over to the High Authorities, who (WOW) Surprisingly is Connelly's characters Father in the movie played by Sam Elliott. Elliott provides a rather stable and believable character, but unfortunately IMO is the only one. Another ""mediocre"" performance is provided by veteran actor Nick Nolte, who plays Bruce's long dead father.

Awful CGI, Which sometimes will have you thinking you are watching a friend playing a Playstation 2 game and an awfully slow storyline will have ANY fan of the Marvel Comic strip both disappointed and annoyed they've parted with the hard earned for buying a ticket to the movie. Long time fans may however enjoy the Comic strip style split screen which Lee uses throughout the picture to tell the story of ""Hulk"".

Hulk (2003) - An ambitious and well done film,"""Hulk"" 2003 is very different from what you would expect from a typical summer popcorn creature-feature. From the advertising campaign it appeared to be a mindless special effects extravaganza with little to no plot whatsoever; AKA Summer Fun. For those who went to see it with that mindset it was undoubtedly a not so pleasant surprise. Most of whom who saw this on its initial theatrical release obviously had not foreseen Ang Lee's philosophical drama, and they instantly retaliated causing Hulk to fail in most ways.

I was surprised, but not in the way these common viewers were, because I loved Hulk. It is a superhero movie unlike any other comic based film in the last twenty-five years. This is a film that is filled with heart and emotion and delivers it fully in ways no other film of this genre has done before it. The art direction and special effects are astounding, and helps bring this comic character to life and oh so much more.

The plot starts off rather simply with David Banner, a geneticist who has been studying regeneration, experimenting on various animals and finally ends up injecting himself. Eventually the mustached scientist has a son - Bruce Banner - who has apparently inherited his father's lab created gene.

We now skip forward several years as Bruce begins studying exactly what his father had all those years before: regeneration. This only ends in what can only be described as disaster as an exposure of ""Gamma Rays"" causes his inherited gene to emerge transforming him into the not so jolly, green behemoth known as the Hulk. From there we are thrown into several well done action sequences as the military under the command of Gen. Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (a very human and well-crafted performance by Sam Elliot) begins an attempt to capture Bruce/Hulk to obtain this gene. Only complicating Bruce's hectic life is the reappearance of his crazed father who also cares more about the studies of his past opposed to his son's well-being which goes beyond abuse before finally leading up to an enormous CGI confrontation between mutated father and son.

The Hulk does lack in the category of CGI at times with quality going up and down during a few cuts, and an adrenaline junkie will not enjoy the level of dialogue and drama that fills this plot that must have been a cinematic fusion between King Kong, Frankenstein and Marvel Comics. Ang Lee perfectly utilizes the split frame, thus turning this film into a living comic book and the entire cast does their part in moving the plot along. This isn't so much a superhero film as it is a doorway looking into the delicacy of humanity. You know and care about the characters, and you can certainly care about the man beneath the giant green muscled frame of the Hulk. That is what the movie is about, not a giant green man smashing things up for ninety minutes like so many 2003 movie goers were expecting.

Sadly this film didn't hit the audience it should've due to Universal's careless advertising that passed this off as a popcorn film. If you're someone who likes emotionally compelling and ambitious tales Hulk (2003) may be the superhero film for you. If you liked Frankenstein or any of the King Kong adaptations Hulk will probably be a movie for you, just don't go in unprepared to think about the material you're viewing. This is one that one should defiantly pay attention to because it is probably the most underrated film of the 20th century.",6.0,13 June 2008
The First Blockbuster and the Biggest Blunder of the Summer,"I am not sure what Ang Lee was thinking here... I came into The Hulk expecting a movie faithful to what makes The Hulk so appealing-- unbridled rage and anger, with lots of stuff being smashed.

Imagine the look upon my face when I realized I spent 90 minutes waiting to get into the theatre and expecting a cool movie... And then getting by far one of the most plodding and boring superhero movies ever made.

To start, we get a very long flashback sequence to take up the first 10 minutes of the film, displaying Nick Nolte looking only marginally better than his infamous DUI mugshot as he tries to unlock the secret to human superiority -- invulnerability to the elements and regeneration. Okay, fine, the writers added in the DNA messing-upping that was completely fine and cool in ""Spider-Man."" I was expecting some Hulk action soon, because I needed something to get my adrenaline pumping-- this is a Hulk movie, and Hulk is all about smashing everything to bits! ...It takes a full hour before the Hulk Up comes, and by then, my interest is waning. He looks great-- CGI being obvious or not, The Hulk looked detailed, and that's all I want.

Too bad you don't see enough of him in the movie all about the big guy. Instead, the viewer gets treated to a convoluted angst plot that seems better suited for a late-90's X-Men comic... Or a shoujo (girl's) anime.

The angst is what killed me-- WHY is there angst in a movie about The Hulk? I don't need psychological analysis of the big green man, and I doubt anyone else does. It padded a film that should have been 90 minutes of pure adrenaline by about an hour, and it wasn't even good padding.

The direction of the scenery was almost a redeeming factor-- Ang Lee is an artist when it came to the comic-book transitions between camera angles, and it was quite the site to my eyes. Unfortunately, the plot cannot be overlooked in place of the pretty pictures (unlike with most other action movies) in this case, so the movie ends up just suffering completely.

Ang Lee should stick to the beautifully-done wuxia flicks, and James Schmaus should be drawn and quartered for his terrible rendition of the legend of the Incredible Hulk.

Plot smarter than its shrubs.,"What a strange and interesting beast of a film. I rather enjoyed it for its pathos and its camp exploration of Bruce's psyche, i enjoyed it for its restrained pacing, i enjoyed it for its lack of cliché in the face of what has got to be one of the stupidest plots this side of King Kong (it is a comic book after all). I enjoyed it rather a lot, that is until the green one started leaping all over the Utah, precipitating a war with his deranged father and generally spoiling all the good work of the previous hour. At that point it just got boring and i promptly fell asleep. Hmmm. Why you may ask? Isn't action what we are paying for here? No, it really didn't seem so to start with, and that's how i was suckered into watching the thing. To me the film initially seemed to be quiet a good attempt at circumventing the idiocy of the original comic book plot and delivering itself as a decent, light hearted, scientific paranoia thriller with a discerning lack of accursed mutants and such-forth to spoil what might have been a nice little plot. Of course this wasn't to be; my desire for Banner to reveal himself as an enraged and perhaps slightly larger than life version of Erica Bana, released from the burden of torn clothes and that dreadfully painful looking change of complexion experienced each time he gets vaguely annoyed was, well, flattened by the rapid emergence of an awfully rendered CGI green bull of a 25 foot tall man out the roof of a laboratory with a healthy comic book zest for destruction. Very, very boring. I was lying on the couch thinking, why couldn't Ang Lee have just gone:

'Okay, we have this character right, and for some reason he turns green and monstrous each time someone pushes the wrong buttons. Very silly. Okay, now, how about we change it to when he gets massively disgruntled he can't control himself and smashes *hit up like the big comic book guy - but lets, for the sake of keeping to the script i've already half written, not make him 25 feet tall, green and able to jump like a giant flea all over the place but someone who has a massive personality shift and a perhaps humongous amount of adrenalin each time someone throws sand in is face and then we just let him loose on the world. Ooo, and hey, lets not turn the ending into a Manga style nobody-understands-nobody-else-chaos-freakout.""

Why didn't he say that? Because if they did that it wouldn't be The Hulk then would it? My problem then is that the film is just far to intellectual in its initial plotting for its own good. With a central character possessing an intellect the size of a shrub any small amount of intelligence is going to be wasted. Its a tragic fact that stupid characters will always ruin any half good idea by stomping all over it. A likely reason why King Kong has been so popular is that it doesn't have this kind of two mind thing going on. The plot IS as stupid as its central character and that seems to help out somewhat. Bruce Banner's Hulk is big and stupid. Ang Lee's The Hulk initially was slim and smart, then the beast took over. And a damn shame because we seem to end up with a somewhat schizophrenic film that seems to justify itself by not making any sense in its finale. Oh well.",6.0,25 January 2006
One Big Yawn,This movie was entirely too long!!! There were so many people in the theater sleeping. There were moments and scenes I felt should have been deleted from the final cut. The movie had been hyped up by the media but when it came time to view it was a major disappointment. It basically was about a lot of scientific mumbo jumbo which hardly anyone understood with a soap opera twist.An actual waste in my opinion. The plot(if you wish to call it that) was very evasive when you thought you finally grasped the concept of the whole movie another issue reared its head!! Overall not enjoyable movie!! This film did an unjustice to the classic v show as well as the comic strip.,3.0,7 July 2003
"Don't understand the hate, very smart film","Hulk is Ang Lee's version of the Hulk which is frequently dismissed as a confused and boring movie. It is actually a much smarter and interesting film than most people give it credit for. Lee gives a deep look into the concepts of rage and isolation to create a serious drama not just a mindless action film which many people weren't expecting.

The story centres on Bruce Banner who is a brilliant scientist with a troubled past. He has an accident in his Lab that exposes him to Gamma Radiation, but he survives and appears unharmed. But since the accident, whenever Banner becomes angry he transforms into a giant green monster and destroys all in his path. As Bruce's father mysteriously shows up it seems that he may get the answers to his past and what is happening to him, as he avoids the army and the girl he loves. Ang Lee must be commended for giving a detailed look at Banner, we get to see his past and how his father shaped his future. It's a great story and always fascinating.

The cast is pretty great overall. Eric Bana is excellent in giving a very understated and quietly intense portrayal of Banner, he does a successful job of showing a man who is on the emotional edge. His expressions and mannerisms fit in very well. Jennifer Connelly gives a solid performance as fellow scientist Betty, she manages to be a strong lead and the connection built up between the two does feel really genuine. Sam Elliott is excellent as the aggressive Ross, he effortlessly moves between viciously perusing Banner and showing a gentler humane side in regards to Betty. Nick Nolte is great as he swings between intense whispering to over-the-top madness, but it works and he's a joy to watch. Josh Lucas is fairly decent in a basic role as the arrogant and unlikeable Talbot.

As said Hulk is certainly one of the most introspective superhero movies ever made, to suggest it is a superhero movie is somewhat difficult due to how everything is portrayed. Bruce Banner is never seen as a hero per say but more as a vulnerable outcast, the action is toned down by a big stretch and the whole basis is much more philosophical than you would expect. This gives the film a richness and uniqueness that's not often found in films of this type. It drags slightly at times, but it can be forgiven for the scope is uses. Visually the film is very unusual, the film is set to look like a moving comic book as the frames switch and move around like a comic book does. At times it does look really great and is an interesting concept, but it has to be said that it is used too much and with more toning down it would be better. Much was made of the CGI, especially on Hulk himself. Again for the most part it does look pretty good mainly for the time and the mannerisms do seem genuine, but at other times its dodgy like on the Hulk Dogs. The action is spectacular when it appears as the whole desert scene is brilliantly made, the entire scope of the scene and how it shows Hulk's leaping ability and strength is great. The climax though inconsistent, is great to view. Danny Elfman creates a powerful score and its nicely different to his usual work. The change of making the Hulk grow the more angry he gets is also a great idea.

Hulk is very underrated, nicely serious film and never loses it's intelligence which is something most modern superhero films suffer from.",9.0,31 October 2013
My expecations were meet,"A lot of the ealry reviews had been complaining about the CGI work in The Hulk and now that movie has come out more people are complaining about how boring the movie is. I'll admit when I first find out they were making a Hulk movie I had my resverastions as soon as I found out there would no classic Marvel villain other than General Ross in the film, I would have loved to see Charles Dance or Alan Ruck play The Leader. So on opening day I mainly went to see the movie to see what Mr. Ang Lee could do with the direction and I was impressed. Lee's editing and split screen transations and wipes give the film a real comic book affect which is why the film impressed me so much. Eric Bana whose carrer I haven't really followed does well as Bruce Banner as do the always good Jennifer Connely and Sam Eillot. I think in the acting department though the film belongs to Nick Nolte as Bruce's father. I don't really see the film as a comic book movie for the fan boy but more of a thinking person's action movie which is a rarity this summer. I give the film *** stars.",7.0,28 June 2003

Would it have been better with another director ?,"Comic book films seem to be all the rage these day. Dramatic storys from the '60s revamped in our day for the big screen. It's an easy idea to take a well-formed character that the public is familiar with and give them a movie treatment. The Hulk is the definitive comic book movie.

The movie is directed by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and stars Eric Bana (Black Hawk Down) in his first major U.S. role and Jennifer Connelly fresh off her Oscar winning role in A Beautiful Mind. Hulk is a show in true comic book form.

The story is the same: Doctor Bruce Banner is hit with gamma rays and given power to become a raging beast when his temper flares. As with all other comic book roles the movie begins with Banner's childhood We see his father was a military scientist. We see his father's madness and then we are taken to Bruce as a teen, then as a full man who has unknowingly followed in his father's footsteps. A mistake is made and 30 minutes into the film Bruce is hit with gamma rays and then 10 minutes later we see Bruce has turned into the Hulk - a full CGI character. The film follows as we see the beast save his love and then himself

The Hulk is an off-beat film. The powerful score by Danny Elfman impresses, as Elfman always does. The direction of Lee is different from any other comic book film we have seen before. The shots are clear but the edits are unlike anything I have ever seen before. You get the feeling that you're watching a comic book - as the actor looks away another screen will pop up mid-shot and show another actor's respond. This gives a throwback feel to the Hulk, yet it is also a distraction to the viewer.

A lot of people have talked about the overuse of CGI in films The Hulk is a fully computer graphic image. When the Hulk first shows himself, it's night and he looks real but later as we see him destroy the streets of San Francisco it's hard to believe that the Hulk is real. Movie special effects have come along way from Clash of the Titans. But we expect more from a film now than in 1981.

Eric Bana's role is overshadowed by the Hulk, where in last year's Spider-Man the super hero role never overtook the character, it just made the role more powerful for the actor. Eric is really never given a chance to act - he is either calm or getting mad and then Hulks out. That's about it for Mr. Bana.

Jennifer Connelly is able to shine in her performance. She looks as beautiful as ever and gives a strong believable role. The great Nick Nolte plays Bruce Banner's long lost father who has a god complex. He wants to find his son and understand what his son has become.

The Hulk is a humorless film very serious in its look and feel. There is only fun when the Hulk is destroying and jumping around. The direction of the film is good, the action is clear and you are not left without understanding what happened until the last 10 minutes of the film when you are left in the dark not knowing what happened to the villain.

It seems that Ang Lee had a great vision for the Hulk but this vision was lost in translation to film in his first film after Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Working with his long-time collaborator James Schamus who co-wrote the screenplay, Lee is searching for the soul of his beast rather than allowing the audience to enjoy him. The background of Bruce Banner is so deep that we really don't care by the end of the film, we just want more smashing.

Most of the questions that viewers have are answered by the end of the film, with one exception. Why is it that no matter how big the Hulk gets his shorts never rip off? Perhaps we will never know.",,19 November 2003

Angst Lee,"The movie poster says it all. This movie is that dark. Not just emotionally, but visually as well. And that is the first of many problems with this film.

Lee never finds his audience. Is the fans of the comic book? If so, he should have stayed true to the original. Or Superhero fans? If so, get rid of the majority of the mental anguish that accompanies The Hulk in the comic books and go with Hulk of Saturday Morning TV. Is it action fans? Then why the whole study of Banner as a person and lack of a 'real' love interest?

Acting was as good as I'd expect from Bana (playing Banner-Hulks human form) considering he had to play against a CGI counterpart. As always, he impressed me.

Connelly was as good as the role allowed her. Thought she did well in the hospital scene where she tells Banner she was watching him die.

Nolte played our villain well, and he scared me. Sometimes the real humans can scare me worse than Dr. O from Spiderman.

The panels worked well. I liked that touch. It reminded me this was a comic.

But it never really found its way to a decent movie. From the darkness, to breaking the 180 degree rule, Lee was trying too hard to make art out of entertainment. And he never pulls it off. Not even close. If I was not a Bana fan (the guy can act his way out of a cardboard box) I'd never have sat through this movie.",7.0,17 July 2004

"THE BEST VERSION OF THE HULK EVER & IN AN EMOTIONAL,SERIOUS,TRAGIC MARVEL CLASSIC!!!","The BRILLIANT Director ""Ang Lee"" made a visually stunning, serious & Tragic very Adult Marvel hero film way back in 2003 but it never got the recognition he deserved, it's an underrated CLASSIC.

Eric Bana is an excellent actor & totally fitted the part of troubled scientist ""David Banner"" he took the role serious & gave a powerful & often emotional performance, to me he is still the best actor we've had to play the role of David Banner & yes he's still better than now ""MCU"" version, yes i really like Mark Ruffalo but Bana is way better & not as comical & i like Ang Lee's c.g.i version of the Hulk still better, i prefer his look & his darker green colour he holds up & looks fantastic still!!!

Also the cast is excellent, from the great gruff veteran actor ""Nick Nolte"" who is so good in his evil psychotic role as Bana's crazy father to another old school veteran star Sam Elliott to the beautiful Jennifer Connelly this has a great cast of excellent talent.

The movie plays out like a serious Dramatic Thriller with some fantasy elements, Ang Lee directed this as a serious work of art & it shows, nearly every scene is shot beautifully, he also plays much more on the tragedy of the character & his dark origin story, Bruce Banner is a troubled man who has seen something horrific as a small boy & along with some evil scientific abuse from his psycho father, he becomes a beast.

I have always loved this comic book movie since it first came out & stand by it & defend it as i do with the excellent & underrated Daredevil & The Punisher all early 2000's Marvel films that most people don't seem to like? But i have always loved all 3 films & in my opinion are still the best Marvel before the MCU was properly set-up.

The performance from Eric Bana is excellent & he really dives into the drama & remains my favourite ""Banner/Hulk"" he's excellent.

Hulk is an excellent serious take on a classic Marvel character by a brilliant masterful Director. Enjoy a real ""Adult"" superhero film.",8.0,6 October 2019

"Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad.....","Ang Lee might be a talented visionary of the scenic tapestry, and landscape of the earthly environs, but this film just stinks. What a mess of a great source material. Man versus self is one of the most common film formulas, and here is the perfect vehicle to further that motif. But Lee manages to invest too much time in the wrong backdrop to pull of the subtlety required to accomplish that task. The Hulk is the moody, irritable, gamma-infused alter ego of Bruce Banner. A freak accident causes the genetic makeup of our protagonist to be horribly changed. Intense emotion, especially anger, triggers a chemical change in Banners body, that transforms him into the immense monster called the Hulk. Lee should have used heavy doses of dark light to enhance the dark tone of the character. Instead he chooses to try to ""comic"" it up, showing the campy cgi Hulk in bright light, and greatly diminishing his awe value. Besides that, the plot of the mad scientist father of Banner, and the unbelievably poorly executed love angle with his lady love Betty, makes this an unwatchable film.",1.0,9 May 2008
You want to watch that temper of yours...,"Though Universal's summer blockbuster has been criticised for the cartoonish feel of the early trailers, the presence of director Ang Lee should be enough to reassure nervous viewers as they take their seats.

And so it proves, as The Hulk eschews the comic-book vibe that proved so successful for last year's Spiderman, instead making an earnest attempt to draw the audience into the science behind the story. The early scenes take us at breakneck speed through the life and work of Dr David Banner, a scientist employed by the military in 1965, working to uncover the secret that allows animals such as the starfish to regenerate themselves. Defying orders not to experiment on human subjects, Banner makes himself a guinea pig. His wife later gives birth to a son, Bruce, and it quickly becomes apparent to Banner that all is not well.

The Hulk himself doesn't make an appearance until nearly an hour into the film, as Lee gives us time to acclimatise to the story, bringing us up to date with the lives of central characters Bruce and Dr Jenny Ross, thirty-something scientists working on the secret of regeneration, no less. And this despite the fact Bruce has never known his parents as an older child, growing up in the care of a foster mother.

The small number of characters allows us to focus on the relationship between the leads and other key figures, so that when the action explodes, we have enough vested in the affair to care about the outcome.

Anyone concerned about the Computer Generated Imagery has nothing to fear: in fact, The Hulk uses some of the most advanced and effective CGI yet seen. At the end of the day, the monster of the title is a wholly computerised character, yet he has to interact with his environment as intricately as the next man. This is a hugely demanding task for any animator, but the effects team give the Hulk real presence and tangible personality, and significantly, give the viewer an awesome impression of his power. The points where the character seems more artificial are those where he is placed in a broader visual context, for example when fleeing the military in the desert, or indulging in a spot of Crouching Tiger-style yogic flying. Conversely, he seems brilliantly real when in a close up scrap, fighting mutant dogs by the side of a river (don't ask), or having his cheek tenderly stroked by his father. In any case, you have to wonder how ""realistic"" a 20-foot green monster would actually seem if you passed one in the street.

The set pieces pile up and the film builds towards the obligatory action-filled conclusion, and surprisingly, the Hulk's greatest enemy turns out not to be the military that have spent most of the film trying to blow him up or drop him from a fighter jet at 80,000 feet. Though some viewers may be left confused by the subplot that leads to the Hulk's final showdown, it nevertheless amounts to a suitably satisfying ending.

Better that I had thought it would be,"Despite its relative unpopularity with IMDb viewers and the generally bad reception it received when it was released, the first ""Hulk"" has a lot going for it. The cast is uniformly wonderful and Ang Lee's direction is surehanded. I particularly enjoyed the special effects, especially the chase scene in San Francisco.

I have a couple of quibbles, though. The worst is that the film 's 138 runtime is far too long. This caused it to drag in spots. Also, Lee couldn't seem to hold a consistent point of view. He shifted, sometimes jarringly, from cartoonish to super-serious darkness. It is a somewhat dark tale but, come on, it's based on a comic book. Thus, I could have done with more good natured fun and less King Lear.

My reservations notwithstanding, I rather liked ""Hulk."" It was often exciting, always pleasant to look at, and had several excellent performances. 7 out of 10.",7.0,13 July 2008
"Please, let there be no sequels","As if they needed yet another comic book turned into a movie, The Hulk sauntered into theatres. And despite the crummy special effects, the slow and listless dialogue, and a running time that seemed far too long and pretentious for a movie like this, it still opened with a bang. Let's hope it doesn't last. But what actually made this movie so bad? If it wasn't for the overwhelming marketing blitz that subconsciously motivated you to watch this film, then obviously the curiosity of a CGI Hulk intrigued you. Sadly, it would have been better with a guy painted green than a CGI cartoon character. I thought I was watching a Pixar movie, not some live action film. Even that last comment was degrading for Pixar. And of course, the big bad government seemed too cartoonish and overused to make it a believable enemy. Let's face it, this movie was nothing more than some overblown episode of some dull and repetitive anime that happened to include live action elements and wooden acting. Let's hope this movie just tanks, so we won't be tortured with yet an unnecessary sequel.",1.0,26 June 2003

I do have to say that there were a lot of holes but overall I say the plot was a very good one for this movie. You would look at this and you would think this is going to be a brainless reek havoc on the city sort of movie but Bruce and the alter ego known as hulk have depth. Hulk isn't just some green guy who is mad he actually shows emotions of sadness and guilt as well as confusion. I occasionally read the Hulk comics from time to time and I must say they did a great job. The roars of the Hulk really blew me away in the theatre. They once again capture a comic book hero as it is in the comics. This like the other comic book movies deserves a sequel because I fell a little more needs to be told.

Cerebral but Distracting With a Slight Touch of Nausea,"Ang Lee's take on ""Hulk"" isn't nearly as bad as you've heard it is, but it isn't very good, either. It attempts to create a different kind of Marvel movie after the good (usually, but mostly similar) fare since 2000's ""X-Men."" The result is a hypnotic mess that elevates in quality simply for the effort given. In fact, the most irritating thing (objectively) about the film is that infernal split-screen use, which makes the film far too frenetic for its own good. The performances here aren't good, but they were better than the worst moments in the ""Spider-Man"" movies. But other than that, it's just an aborted attempt at something with a movie hidden underneath all the layers of moderate bizarrity and its Big Brother ethic. In other words, the only way to purposefully find hidden meaning here would be to dissect the film a la High School English. But in doing so, don't beat it to death.

Overall, this movie really sucked. I am not saying it is the worst movie ever made, but it is the worst comic book movie I have ever seen, with Daredevil a close second. 2/10

Almost A Classic,"After SpiderMan and Xmen2, I was expecting very little from Hulk. While the aforementioned movies were entertaining enough, they pale in comparison to Ang Lee's Hulk. I thought the CGI in the commercials looked cartoony, at best, and wretched, at worst. However, once you are drawn into the movie, the CGI becomes brilliant,at times; it's acceptable, at others. It's nowhere near as expressive as Gollum from LOTR:The 2 Towers, but the musculature (and hard work it takes to make that believable) serves its purpose. Bottom line: the CGI doesn't detract from the story, but boosts it at the appropriate times: and that's the most one can expect at this stage from CGI characters. The acting is on the mark, with Bana very convincing as Bruce Banner. Nolte and Connely deliver in their roles equally well. The direction, however, is a little mixed. At times, the segues and fades that Lee chose in this movie were awesome. However, the oddly spaced moments of turning the screen into a comic page were not only irritating, they snapped you away from the movie itself. The 'comic pages' only remind you that this is based on a comic, and therefore, shouldn't be taken seriously. This would seem to be the exact opposite of what you'd want to achieve. The music by Danny Elfman is nonexistent, at best, and merely more of his usual drivel. He evidently blew his wad on Batman. Aside from the odd direction, this could've been a classic comic adaptation, almost up to Superman and Batman levels. On a 4-star scale, it gets 2.5 stars. As it was, the odd 'comic screens' and poor music hold it back.",7.0,21 June 2003
Too bland and dark,"I'll admit, I like dark movies. They're very interesting to watch, as long as their is an emotionally driven backdrop. Hulk doesn't have this.

It's pretty much 2 1/2 hours of anger, hate, fear, and freaky people who have no true feelings for anyone. Jennifer Connelly is the only emotional one, and she is so emotional it is very dark. The movie is really depressing; it barely even has daylight for Christ's sake! All the performances are bland and 1-dimensional, not giving human depth to really any character. My favorite character was Thunderbolt Ross because he borough more emotion than any other character, despite having a 2 1/2 dimensional character development.

Eric Bana is a good actor but he is probably the worst of them all; nobody is bad but his role is so strange and freaky it's scary. Nick Nolte as David Banner is pretty much the same way but he is the baddie, and deserves to be that way. He is a very fun villain to watch on the screen and deserved more than one action sequence. I especially loved his scene where he shows up in Betty Ross' house and talks to her.

The CGI and action sequences were impressive; dark, but all fun to watch. Each one was pieced together like beautifully disturving works of art, and is one of the things that kept the movie from getting boring.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend Hulk really for anyone unless you're into the dark, 1-dimensional and nonsensical action films. Not something I'd watch often. 5.8/10.",6.0,11 August 2007

Upsides And Downsides,"Ang Lee attempt to create a brooding melodrama while trying to stay true to the live-action comic genre generally works but, typical of Lee's work, there's a lack of depth that renders everything static and half-formed. It tries to be soulful but ends up humorless and blurry. On the upside, Lee is probably more successful than anyone has been in actually recreating the kinetic rush and intensity of comic-book art: he moves a number of multi-panels of shifting sizes on and off the screen; he freezes various shots, giving them a drawn look; and he ingeniously uses depth of vision in the action scenes (often to humorous effect: a tank thrown like a discus crashes with a poof in the background). On the downside, Lee and longtime collaborator, writer James Shamus, aren't sure how they perceive their subject. They position Hulk as the rage-filled opposite of mild-mannered hero Bruce Banner (Eric Bana, the Australian actor whose obvious attempts to hide his accent actually adds to his intensity), who claims to enjoy the mass destruction; yet he becomes the monster only as an act of self-defense and only seeks to protect himself. They also take their own sweet time on developing the relationship between Banner and his scientist father (Nick Nolte, delivering a lazy, shapeless performance) with too much of it told in flashback; it ends up indistinct and unresolved. (Lee and Schamus also try, late in the film, to make a supervillian out of Nolte but they jettison that idea almost as quickly as they introduce it.) Still, though there could have been more of the effective computer effects designed to highlight the various emotions displayed on Hulk's face, it's pretty well made, an attempt to provide an adult perspective that goes beyond the usual sophisticated production design and yet provide reasonable entertainment value--it may not be the righteous effort Lee is striving for but it's not without its pleasures.",7.0,18 July 2003

Before seeing it I heard so much hype sense the super bowl commercial. the movie had A major debut so when I saw I thought I was the only one that didn't really like it. There is a hulk villain that can absorb things but it is not his father who is named Brian not David.

"Disappointing, considering the director and cast","I do remember seeing this film on TV once, and other than the visuals, good music and two or three decent performances I didn't think much of it. I was considering a re-watch, but was advised by a very reliable and trust-worthy pen pal not to. But as I have said many times about other movies, I was curious. As I do love the director and think highly of the cast, I did finally give it a chance. And my initial reaction sadly hasn't changed.

I will give credit where it's due. It is an artistically tasteful film, with wonderful cinematography and editing and the effects are great. The score is also memorable and more importantly fits with the movies' tone. And I found Eric Bana very charismatic in his role, and I enjoyed Sam Elliot too.

Jennifer Connelly does okay with what she's got, but I didn't find her character as interesting, in fact she came across as unnecessary and vapid at points. Nick Nolte I like, but he overplays here and it doesn't help that his whole story was on the misconceived side and in a way feels like a different movie altogether.

I mostly liked Lee's direction too. I am very fond of Lee, he is a great director and has a very distinctive style which comes through loud and clear with Hulk, and I love his films. Brokeback Mountain and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are two of my favourite movies of all time, I love the Ice Storm and Sense and Sensibility is one of the better period drama films I've seen.

Although he does do a decent enough job here despite a tendency to let his style get in the way of telling the story and making us connect to the characters(the only time I have felt this about him), sometimes even impressive, there are reasons why this is my least favourite film so far of his.

First off, I wasn't all that impressed by the action. Not that it was badly edited or choreographed, in fact these scenes are done with efficient style and the choreography doesn't look all that clumsy. It is all to do with tone, most of the action sequences here don't fit all that well with the feel of the overall film, the fight with the poodles is a prime example, which felt rather silly compared to the film's intensity.

The script has some brooding lines from Bana and Elliot, but some lines feel stilted or delivered in a bland fashion. Which brings me to the story, I loved the idea and had no problem with it. It also started off great. Its problems was that the more over-complicated it got, the more leaden the pace got too and the more things were left with little to no explanation, leading to one of the weakest and most disappointing endings I've seen for any comic book movie. Ridiculous is a more ideal way to describe it.

All in all, considering the director, concept and cast involved, Hulk was very disappointing and didn't live to hopeful expectations of improvement on re-watch. 4/10 Bethany Cox",4.0,16 September 2011
"""Hulk"" & the state of criticism of it","Ang Lee's ""Hulk"", at two years after.

Perusing the negative reviews of the film collected at the Rotten Tomatoes site, I'm stricken by the degree to which the negativity directed at it by allegedly professional film critics is based upon the fact that it dashed (rather than living up to) their rather low expectations for it. The assumptions underlying so many of the criticisms are that the film is supposed to be a brainless ""summer blockbuster,"" but isn't. Another variation: that it's a film based upon a comic book, and that all such projects are supposed to be mindless rubbish for dazzling bumpkins (To those of us with some genuine knowledge of the field, this variant is particularly entertaining in that it's inevitably accompanied by a string of authoritative assertions regarding comics which demonstrate only the offended critics' abysmal ignorance of the medium). ""Hulk,"" it seems, doesn't know its place; it commits the sin of aiming for something more than mediocrity. In a sense, this is a testament to the film's quality. It clearly doesn't cater to such low expectations.

Criticism of the film's CGI--a more common one at places like IMDb where there's far less pretense that a poster actually has anything of value to say--can be set aside as the superficial whining it is. In spite of what so many ""summer blockbuster"" fans seem to think, special effects aren't a story; they're just a means of telling one. The CGI in ""Hulk"" is competent. Beyond that, it doesn't matter.

Likewise the vacuous ""it's boring"" complaint. Modern viewers with no attention span be advised up front that you will find ""Hulk"" challenging, and would be better served by spending your ""entertainment"" budget on trash like ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" and leaving the real movies to the adults.

I don't insist that a fan of typical Hollywood summer fare actually offer some rational critique of the picture--I'm not a cruel man. I do, however, insist that, for anyone who expects to be taken seriously, ""Hulk"" must be accepted or rejected for what it really is. For my part, I think it's a misunderstood minor masterpiece, a film in the vein of ""Blade Runner"", ""Excalibur,"" and ""Once Upon A Time In The West""--all generally snubbed in their day, all now just as generally hailed as classics. I'd like to think I live in a society where this is the fate that one day awaits ""Hulk""; it certainly deserves it. Time will tell, I suppose.",9.0,29 June 2005

Good cure for insomnia,"OK, so I didn't see this on the big screen. My wife and I rented it.

First night: started to fall asleep almost immediately. It wasn't that late, but we may admittedly have been tired. Still, we've seen a lot of movies in that state, and as long as they are interesting, we somehow manage to stay awake.

I decided to trudge through it until the first transformation, at which point I figured I'd be able to stay awake. No such luck... I was falling asleep DURING the transformation. We gave up, and decided to get a good nights sleep and pick up from where we left off the next day.

Second night: same thing. Started with the transformation, during which were parts we didn't remember - because we must have been dozing. So we watched that whole scene again. Didn't help.

Shrek on steroids?,"It is not strange that Ang Lee's The Hulk generated a fairly big audience, it being based on a famous comic book character and all. But it is almost laughable that such a high amount of people found it to be very satisfying and well made. One critic even wrote that `The Hulk' himself is far better animated than his two colleges `Gollum' from Lord of the Rings trilogy and `Dobby' from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Please..

I ask: Did those people even stay awake the entire movie? To me it looks like Shrek on steroids and when you see Nick Nolte you get a flashback to his mugshot days. The only enjoyable thing I found in it was the comic book feel Lee uses in his choice of camera angles.

But still.. I beg you. Do not watch this movie. Not even for a good laugh.",,7 January 2004
The Worst Comic Book Movie.....almost.....,"As a fan of the Marvel and DC comic books growing up, I have to say it was with no small measure of happiness when I heard they were going to make and release a big-budget Incredible Hulk movie. I have to say I was disappointed in the biggest way possible.

I was (and still am) a fan of the original Hulk TV show with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno both playing the dual roles of Bruce Banner and The Hulk. However, even though I felt Eric Bana did a decent job as the tormented Doctor Banner in this movie, I felt that the movie was very lacking. One, the Hulk looked like a cross between Shrek and the Jolly Green Giant. Two, the aggravating ""fade-in to other scenery shots"" you see throughout the movie. Three, the scenes where they try to make it like a comic book. And finally, instead of a villain from the comics, like The Leader, or The Abomination, heck even Doc Sampson, who, while not a bad guy, would've made for a cool fight in the movie, they let his dad become The Absorbing Man. A villain from the Thor comics.

Sure, they got the story somewhat right, and in terms of bringing it to the screen, they did OK. But to me there are, and always will be, superior comic-book movies. If you're a Hulk fan, this movie will disappoint. Trust me. However, if you really aren't into comics, or are just kind of playing at the edges, then you should really like it.

I give it a 6 out of 10.",6.0,19 April 2006
Better Than You Remember!,"I was pleasantly surprised how well this has held up over time. It certainly has it's drawbacks, but in treating the character of the Hulk as a King Kong-esque spectacle, Ang Lee's slow burn of a movie is really quite effective.

The drawbacks to the film are pretty obvious however, the comic book editing style has never transferred well onto the screen and it can be really quite distracting at times but if you can stomach the style of Raimi's first Spider-Man movie then you'll probably be fine with this. I have no words for the dogs though... that's just stupid. The only major flaw of the movie is sadly the casting. With the exception of Nick Nolte, every character feels miscast. Jennifer Connelly is wasted in this film, in the same way that Liv Tyler was in her respective movie (neither of which passes the Bechdel test). As for Eric Bana, I'm not overly familiar with his work, but I'm not a fan of him in this. You root for the Hulk in the film, or rather you're just waiting for him to appear since Bana lacks both the intensity of a Billy Bixby or an Edward Norton, and the likeable nature of a Mark Ruffalo.

So, the appeal of this film isn't the acting or the style, but there are some good action scenes and the pacing does a great job of laying out the story and keeping you intrigued.

It's far from perfect, and it does exist as an oddity of the early 2000s, but since the special effects largely hold up very well, it's not unbearable and is worth a watch if you've somehow gone through every other piece of Marvel media.",6.0,4 October 2022
Fails on so many levels....,"I didn't expect much from this having laughed at the trailer. Having seen it I can't say that Hulk succeeds on any level, though possibly the split screen (comic book) camera angles are an effective feature to have on this comic ripoff. Nothing need be said about the acting...it was awful.

The public generally hated the special effects, and for once they are correct. As computer animation goes, this is by far the least convincing of this century. The realism was so absent that they might as well have just painted in the big green guy. He didn't match with the scenery and the physics governing his movements didn't resemble the way any object (living or otherwise) might move on Earth. The closest depiction I can compare the Hulk to is that of a bouncing rubber baby/frog on the moon. Somehow I was more convinced by the original King Kong and virtually any claymation figure you may care to name.

The screenplay was far too unfocused to hold any tension. The characters motives were far too one dimensional hold any interest. In general the 70's TV show was better in spite of Lou Ferrigno's comical grunting and flexing...at least he looked like a real creature. What I liked about the TV show was that the main focus wasn't just about a monster that breaks things...though that's how it usually ended (thanks Lou). The main focus was on the issues surrounding David Banner (very well acted by Bill Bixby). It was a good exploration of the nature of human emotions and in a way it could be compared to the secluded lives of people who for whatever reason fall through the cracks or have a side of themselves that they can't show. I didn't really get any of that from the movie, which seemed to be all over the place. I felt the same way about the new Planet of the Apes, though that was at least somewhat watchable.",1.0,16 January 2004

Was that the Hulk or The Jolly Green Giant,"I will be honest..the trailers and commercials made me not want to see this movie. I was a big fan of the TV show. When I saw the Hulk looking like a 12 foot Jolly Green Giant instead of how he was on TV, it kind of turned me away. But when I woke up this morning, I started reading the reviews and figured what the heck?

Overall, it was not a bad movie. Eric Bana did an excellent job as Bruce Banner. And any movie with Jennifer Connelley is all right for me. The two actors that really stole the show were Sam Elliott as Connelly's Army General father and Josh Lucas (from SWEET HOME ALABAMA). Nick Nolte looked like he just walked out of his DUI arrest.

The only real problems I had was the fact that the Hulk was twelve feet tall and looked like the Jolly Green Giant. It would have been better if an actual actor played the role as Lou Ferrigno did on TV. I guess that's what we've come to expect in the world of CG.

The other thing I hated was the fact that kept doing the split screen thing. HELLO PEOPLE..this is a movie, not a comic book. This annoyed the heck out of me. Also, the ending was kind of corny. Made me say out loud ""all ritey then.""

Oh, don't take the kiddies to this. It was PG-13 for a reason. This is NOT Spider-Man. Some pretty disturbing scenes involving animal experimentation, especially in the beginning credits. And there were was a pretty violent scene when the Hulk was fighting the mutant dogs. This could have very well been an ""R"".

so bad it's worse,"i'll admit right out that the hulk was never quite a favorite comic book of mine. i tended to find the hulk annoying. my opinion changed when the TV series came around, and they managed to create a compelling tale out of this idea. while the effects were very primitive (with the hulk's green often wearing off of his body as he moved around), i could buy the show.

when the movie came around, i largely banked on it being an ang lee production thinking that he could make it really really good. boy was i wrong.

to begin with, the script simply doesn't work. i don't know whether the goals were too ambitious or what, but the result was endless exposition about something i ultimately didn't care about. the whole subplot about bruce's mother being murdered by his father did nothing for me. the hulk itself honestly made me laugh out loud when i first saw it. i just couldn't take it seriously or suspend my disbelief.

and nick nolte...oh my god...he was terrible.

i actually walked out of the theater on this one but later decided to check out the ending out of curiosity, thinking maybe there was something i'd missed or that i was being unfair. i wasn't. the ending is as laughable as the rest of the movie.

i guess the moral of the story is, don't try to make hamlet out of a comic book, and don't assume that just because spider man and the x-men translated well to the screen that every comic book hero is going to work as a movie. the hulk proved to us pretty tellingly that this is not the case.

"great director, poor screenplay","First of all, I have to admit I am not familiar with Hulk comic books and I have only seen the series and films with Lou Ferrigno. While those were great fun to watch, this version was a bit of a disappointment. Here's why:

Hulk smash puny sub-par metaphysical movie,"I'm not going into the plot for this one, everyone knows the basic idea, so i'll go right into my feelings of the movie. Perhaps Ang Lee wasn't the best choice for this film. When one goes to see a Hulk movie, they want high action and massive destruction, not a highly dramatic snooze-fest for most of the movie only to give some little fan service towards the end of the film. To say I was let down from the film is a bit of an understatement, the film is just NOT true to the characters in the least, especially the ending fight, which is so absurd, so confusing, and so utterly contemptible toward the comic that it's based on that I was itching to just get out of the theater (actually I did leave, only to watch the film in full on DVD to give it a second chance) Upon second viewing, did I like it more?

Either/or,"Hulk tries to be all touchy/feely for the new age/romcom crowd, and eye candy beat 'em up for the comic crowd. As a result, it falls between two stools and satisfies neither group.

I own up to being one of the comic crowd. I didn't go to this movie to see angst and emotional upheaval and shades of half-remembered child abuse. I went to see a big green brainless dude throwing tanks over the horizon. So I thoroughly enjoyed the latter part of the film, but there was much which I feel merited criticism.

1. Presumably the revised origin was so as to bring the abuse thing in. Nothing wrong with the comic origin, though - they should have used it.

2. Get on with it! Far too much twittering around before Hulking out set in.

"Promises a lot, but doesn't deliver","Let me first say, I am a massive fan of Ang Lee's work, he is astounding. I am also a fan of the Hulk character, so my hopes fr this movie were pretty high.

I'm torn about my opinion of this movie, because I think it's great that the story has such intelligent, adult themes and introspective looks at the characters, rather than one-line meaningless dialog of most of the other comic book adaptations, I think the effects are superb, direction faultless (I love the little comic book style visual breaks up on the screen) and superb photography.

However, the story is ultimately too grand, and at the end rather confusing, you leave this movie just confused. The love connection between Jennifer Connely's character Eric Bana's Bruce/Hulk is just not believable. In my opinion Connely completely over acts everything in this movie, making her time on screen annoying.

The pacing of the story is also too slow, I mean it takes over 40 minutes to finally see the Hulk. The Hulk action sequences are superb, and once they start yo get the sense that the movie will pick up, but in the end the actions sequences are separated by too much exposition and character development, and a slowing down of pace.

As I said, the ending is confusing and a let down on previous action sequences, which is why i say this movie promises a lot but doesn't deliver. The direction is good, but the pace too slow, the action sequences are great, but too few and far between, Bana is excellent, but not given good dialog (it's a shame and a surprise he isn't returning for the sequel, he is really is good).

I think this movie is ultimately great example of how hard it is to get big budget comic book adaptations right. Do you go for the comic book crowd and alienate those that don't know the Hulk and his history? Do you dumb it down and annoy the true fans? Do you skew it towards the young fans and negate story, leaving older fans feeling left out, or do you go for a more mature movie, leaving the kids screaming for action? I guess these guys tried to do it all, but ultimately that's caused it to be disjointed and unfulfilling, although still better than most comic book adaptations.",6.0,4 October 2007

Eric Bana is a fine Bruce Banner but he just isn't that interesting to watch, neither is Jennifer Connelly. Nick Nolte steals the show though he's great as this mad scientist & heartless father. I just wish we couldve felt more of a rivalry with him and bruce cuz there isn't too many scenes of them together and that final battle they have is too short.

unfairly criticised,"For me I felt more than a pang of annoyance when seeing the praise being heaped on the flash but insipid X men 2 and the corny and shakily put together spiderman films when this then was criticised for everything that was its strength.

The storyline of repression of emotion is a faithful yet modern interpretation, the opening scenes covered a great deal of necessary yet potentially dull story telling in a fast and effective way. Lee constantly references the story's original medium and employs arguably the best damn editing alongside JFK that I have ever seen.

Special effects are always going to be important for this type of film and they impressed me far more than other comic related offerings of recent years, or ever in fact. But the notion that a fifteen foot green man does not look real becomes ludicrous, the story of the hulk will always need a higher degree of suspension of disbelief than your normal plot.

Let's be fair - Hulk is not a bad movie. Ang Lee doesn't know how to make a bad movie. Having said that, was he the right guy for this movie? Hmmm... The story comes across more as an art-house type Greek tragedy than a superhero flick, when people really just want to see The Hulk and The Abomination pummelling each other. They did so in the Incredible Hulk, a lame reboot nobody went to see.

The action beats, when they do eventually come, are pretty impressive. We see Big Green taking on tanks, helicopters and, er, poodles. The Hulk himself looks really weird now. People were criticising the CGI even then, and of course, time has not improved it. It would be a while before they would get the Hulk right. One thing that I hadn't seen before was the framing of some shots in the style of comic book panels, a technique later borrowed by other comic-book movies (see Kick-Ass).

The Hulk has never been a dialogue driven story, and this movie benefits from the use of visuals to propel the narrative. Ang Lee has obviously studied the visual techniques of comic books and masterfully applied them to film. He uses refreshingly complex camera angles and transitions scenes through picture in picture comic frames. He achieves surprising depth using reflections in glass and shifts of focus. He also increases the relative impact of the CGI by reserving it only to scenes where it's absolutely necessary.

My favorite aspect of the film is the relaxed pacing and emphasis on story telling. Unlike the A.D.D. addled DareDevil, we're given the opportunity to understand and sympathize with Hulk's origin and complexities, without missing a terrific roller coaster ride of action sequences. The dream sequences are similarly thoughtful, presenting metaphors and symbols of Banner's ongoing transformation in surreal images and colors rather than cliche black and white shaky-cam dreams.

As I said, this combination of art and literature won't appeal to everyone. People expecting 120 minutes of ""Hulk SMASH!"" will certainly be bored. Sure, there's plenty of action, but it's broken up by too much of this talking and acting stuff to keep them interested. Comic book accuracy nuts will also be put off by the detail changes to the origin and supporting characters. However, people looking for the unlikely combination of foreign film complexity in a sci-fi action film will be surprised and pleased.",7.0,20 June 2003

Too long for what it has to show,"Although it technically is superhero action, Hulk puts a bigger accent on human drama than most of the previous superhero movies. It has really good characterization and its strength lies more in a good story than in special effects. Still, however strong its story is, it is not strong enough to keep attention for two and a half hours, so after a while the film becomes boring. If they would rearrange exactly the same story to fit into an hour and a half I would probably give it solid 8, but this way I simply can not go over

A bad dream that won't go away.,"The Hulk is like a bad dream that won't leave your mind. It's one of those dreams that makes you feel all yucky while you are in it, but then when you wake up you kind of like it. You keep coming back to it throughout the day saying, ""Oh yeah, heh heh...that was weird!"" You don't totally dislike it but you don't really know what to make of it either. It's like all this random stuff that seems meaningless together. Close ups of fungus on rocks....hmm....weird. I wonder what made me think of that? Monotonous dialogue and people that act like

mannequins...wherever did I come up with that? Oh, and what about those

weird dogs? Yeah, that was a weird dream. Huh.

Weird dreams are great, in and of themselves, but they don't really translate well to great storytelling. Go ahead, try to explain your weird dream to a friend and note their reaction. ""Yeah man, there was this like, fungus, and then there were these poodles in the trees, and this weird music.""

""Huh,"" notes friend, "" so what are you up to this weekend [change of subject]?""

Weird dreams do not a film make. At least not this weird dream. This movie is like a dream you had of the film of the Hulk, not the actual film itself.

Hulk speaks to all of us,"Even as a kid just reading comic books, I found Hulk the most captivating superhero of all of them. Because even kids can relate with someone who's got so much pent up anger stored inside him that the slightest trigger can result in an epic mayhem around him. It's in fact the childhood when we know this firsthand, because we're still allowed to release some of that anger with relative impunity. But, as we age, we become more and more like Bruce Banner, who starts out putting up with frustration and trauma of his existence with a stiff upper lip. Then, after a freak accident in his laboratory, his inner self, through Hulk, becomes his outer self. And he answers our adult question for us: what if I just go berserk on everyone one day? Because Hulk does and does it in really awe inspiring manner. As a monstruously strong green creature of uncontrollable rage, he smashes everything in his path to pieces as long as this state of his lasts. All the while, and I'm talking about the comic books, he remains very introspective and precocious about what he has become, and guilt and shame quickly take the place of rage and destruction. Then something triggers him again and the cycle repeats on and on.

""Hulk"" from 2003 is about the fairest and deepest portrayal of the character of Hulk to date. It follows the source material not only in content but also in form. The director Ang Lee has really put some effort in innovation and gave us the film that not only covers the inner Hulk as well as the ""smash"" Hulk that most want to see, but also looks like a comic book itself. And that makes for a refreshing and artful visual experience. The cast must have recognized the value in the script and they didn't just go ahead and phone their perfomances in.

It's a captivating and memorable experience and it's too bad the owners of the rights to Hulk chose to go different avenues after this. As of late Hulk has been relegated to an ineffective and cliched sidekick in a bigger story of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but the character really deserved better. ""Hulk"" from 2003 was better.",10.0,9 May 2022
"The good, the bad and the ugly","I have just seen the hulk and was quite looking forward to it, although I did approach the movie with a little skepticism after watching the trailer.

The good. The way the film is shot is beautiful, the locations, the style of photography, the editing, the use of already existing comic themes to cut and fade left me really impressed. There is no doubt that Ang Lee knows his way around the camera. There are some good performances in there aswell. Jennifer Connelly gave an understated, mature performance as Dr. Ross. Nick Nolte who has had his share of problems plays Banners father with menace and humanity in equal measure and really seems quite unhinged. The leading man playing Bruce Banner was also good and reminded me strangely of Corey Fieldman.

The Bad, for everything going in hulks favour, the most unsatisfactory thing about it is there is too much contrast. The movie lurches from an emotionally charged scene to CGI action too dramatically, too many times. Most memorable is from an escape scene to an almost theatrical moment when bruce must face his past. The audience couldnt take Nick Nolte´s speech seriously after just seeing the Hulk going crazy and laying waste to just about everything in site. The movie needed to make up it mind whether it wanted to be a comic orientated summer blockbuster or a thoughtful take on the genre. As I said in this instance I felt it was a bridge too far.

The Ugly, for all the speculation after the trailers release what did I think of the CGI hulk. Hmmmmmm, it is really difficult, but now we are all used to digital effects, the hulk left me cold. Yes it was impressive that ILM (i believe it was) induced emotion from the graphic, yes his movement seemed largely realistic. For me it was in the conceptual stage when it went all wrong. The hulk seems half cartoon and half real. It just doesnt work.

Summary: Go and watch the hulk, even if it is just out of curiousity, the acting, shooting and editing are worth it. The contrast between reality and the comic are strong and sometimes work well. But overall, try not to laugh when you see the hulk, as half the audience in the cinema did when I watched it. Because after that you just cant take it seriously.",6.0,1 July 2003
Not worth it,"Warning, this review may ruin the movie.

This movie was terrible! I couldn't believe how bad it was overall. The movie lacked many things. One being a normal camera view, it was cool for the first couple of minutes with the comic book angles, but not the whole movie. Also it lacked a sense of intelligence, I (along with many others) did not understand why every transition was them zooming out from an object, especially a rock growing a fungus on it. Lastly, it lacked The Hulk. When you make a movie on a guy who turns into a beast, make him the beast for more than two scenes. The movie also jumped around the size of the hulk. The original hulk did not grow 15 feet tall, he was just an extremely strong man. He also did not the ability to jump 100's of feet. All in all, this film is not worthy of the name The Hulk, and is not worthy of our money.",1.0,3 January 2004
Simply laughable,"This movie is totally rediculous! I cannot believe they released it. The acting is amateur, save Jennifer. The Hulk's abilities are ludicrous.

I actually liked this movie,"The time spent on Bruce Banner's background probably shouldn't have been left in the final cut. It just took time away from mayhem.

If I had have directed that movie, it would have started with the Hulk just walking down a street, kicking cars over buildings and throwing mimes into the stratasphere. Then the tanks come along, so he can throw them and bash them to death with other tank bits, then he could have gone on to wipe out villages and then all sorts of strange and cool things would attack him, and he'd destroy them all easily.",7.0,26 June 2003

The director should be shot,"As an independent film maker myself I can see where he was trying to go with this ... but it just didn't work. Yes, the effects were good and the acting was OK - but the mix of styles just didn't meld. The director couldn't decide if he wanted a comic book, an art movie, a pure action/effects movie, or a slow drawn out drama.

A hit of entertainment!,Ang Lees terrific film Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was a show of his brillance now he's enlightend it with us again. A doctor experimenting with scientific studies finds himself soon aenough a massive green hulk whenever anger seems to strike. Jennifer Connely plays Bruces love intrest and also the daughter of a four star general who had Bruces father locked and plans to do the same for Bruce. He battles for his freedom from the army halfway through the movie until they place him in a desert base. I liked the action intensity that the movie contained but the only downfall of the film was the daffy looking computer-generated hulk. I would found the movie to be even better if they would have just used a regular person. We find great acting in the film especially from Nick Nolte who plays Bruces father and also the reason who is and Sam Elliot who gives the film its intelligence and the reason why it belongs on stage. Hulk seems to be like no other character like Batman or Superman because he doesnt actually save people from danger but he tries to avoid. SEE IT!,7.0,21 June 2003

Could have been better,"I guess one of the biggest problem with this film is the so-so acting of Eric Bana. Every scene he's in, that involves him to participate in a dialogue or show emotion is badly acted, in my opinion. At times I found myself laughing at how bad he actually was. Something that also ruined a lot of the movie was the transitions; they were mostly bad, and very misplaced, and took the feeling or intensity out of the scenes. That's probably the biggest mistake the movie makes. The plot is pretty good, considering how much it strays away from the original story of the Hulk character. The acting is sometimes decent, sometimes laughable. Unfortunately, mostly the latter. Eric Bana as mentioned earlier, and Sam Elliott both perform pretty badly. The special effects are incredible; definitely the best thing about this movie, with the action scenes(mostly) coming in a close second. The action is mostly good, though I found some scenes, especially the very last one, somewhat dull. It could have accomplished a bit more, I think. I guess fans of the Hulk character, especially his rage, might enjoy this. Most other people may enjoy the sci-fi aspect of the film, or maybe even the drama aspect. I can't say I particularly enjoyed a lot of this film, except for the few good action scenes, and the state-of-the-art special effects, of course. Most of the rest of the film is nothing special. I recommend this to big fans of comic book movies, and fans of the original comic book, who are not uptight about the story being changed around a bit. 6/10",6.0,6 March 2004

The angrier Hulk gets, the bigger he gets! The Hulk is 15 feet tall!

Best Hulk story ever!

It's a sad and powerful story.

In The Incredible Hulk vol. 2 #312, Bruce Banner suffered abuse from his father Brian Banner because of his abilities, as well as from jealous adults, which affected the rest of his lives.

When the Gamma Bomb that Banner himself designed went off and Banner took the brunt of it all. Against all odds, he survived the explosion, but his DNA became forever altered from the gamma radiation, and awakened something inside of him: a raging spirit that dwelled within him since he was a child.

Now, whenever Banner loses control of himself, his anger manifests into the form of a towering, green giant that threatens all around him, known to many as ""The Incredible Hulk"".

Incredibly Boring,"Word on this was mixed, people either loved it or hated it and having watched this twice put me into the loath it group.

Technically this is one of the best looking comic films ever made. My guess is that had the TV show producers had the technology they might have made something that looked like this. The fact that they didn't is a real shame since what they lacked in special effects budget they made up for in the story department. The film makers here had the opposite problem, a special effects budget but no story.

The film has been praised as being deeply thoughtful. My guess is that people confuse ""meaningful"" silences for meaning. The vast majority of this film comes across as people looking intently not saying anything, granted its a metaphor for the inability to speak, or act, and that the Hulk is the opposite, the man of unrestrained action, or some such garbage, what ever it is its boring and there is no point trying to find deep meaning in it.

The performances are flatter than the comic book. Sam Elliot is one note. Jennifer Connelly is so stiff I thought she had her Oscar give the performance. The worst is Eric Bana who is so stiff, so empty, so un-breathing that all I can do is wonder where in the hell they dug his corpse up? I wouldn't call his performance a performance, unless you think the creations in a wax museum perform. He isn't bad, he isn't good he's just there. I screamed at one point ""Will you do something?"" only to be rightfully told to shut up, after all inanimate objects don't move. Buildings and statues in the background have more personality than Bana.

Much of the problem I have to lay at the feet of director Ang Lee who seems to have put together a film of discards, he got rid of everything but the silence. What was he thinking? You can't even get lost in the action since the Hulk doesn't even show up until an hour into the movie, and then the score runs counter to any excitement the scenes might generate.

I don't know what these people were thinking.

Hulk come's off pretty small,"I hope this entry in the Marvel character films does not prevent someone from bringing back the Hulk in another future movie. The Hulk is too much of a favorite to die off with one bad film.

I give credit to Ang Lee for trying something different and thinking outside the box, but the split screen came off as just being a big distraction - not artistic.

I personally liked most of the scenes with the big green guy, especially the fight scene with the tanks and the one where he's latched on to the F15 jet. But this film tried to go too far into the back story and scientific side of the Bruce Banner character and ended up really bogging down the film.

Good performance: Sam Elliott - this guy can almost bring any film or role some legitimacy. His performance as General Ross really bolsters the latter scenes of the movie when the military is going full force after the Hulk.

Bad performance: Nick Nolte - Nolte looks completely loaded - what did this guy do - throw his script in the crap can, chug a bottle of bourbon in his dressing room and just wing it for the rest of the movie! (sure looks like it) his final scenes are awful.

Please - somebody who knows what they're doing - Bring back the Hulk and do him justice. Maybe a battle with Thor - yeah! I'd pay admission to see that!",,23 February 2007

Disappointing to say the least,"I grew up reading the Hulk comic books and watching him on TV. The Hulk has always been something that one could relate to. Superior strength in the face of danger or bad guys. This movie turned the Hulk into something too far out there to relate to. Leaping over deserts, falling from the rim of space and then taking a swim, tossing tanks around like they were made of plastic, all much too far beyond what the Hulk really is.

The editing was very distracting with it's split screens all to often. It reminded me more of a first year college student trying to impress someone. The split screens were completely distracting and a waste of time.

All in all, the movie dragged on mercilessly which equates to boring. It was not the Hulk we grew up to know and the split screen action was dumb. It's a real shame they did this to the Hulk.",7.0,11 May 2004

Awful,,2.0,18 July 2007
You wouldn't want to see me when I'm angry.,"The legendary comic book character comes to the big screen with this overblown adaptation, a combination of character-driven drama and way over the top action. Eric Bana stars as the tormented Bruce Banner, research scientist whom fate turns into an enormous, green-skinned entity with true destructive power. His primary antagonist is a vindictive Army general (Sam Elliott), who bore a grudge against Bruces' deranged father (played by Nick Nolte as an old man), a fellow scientist who sowed the seeds for Bruces' monstrous future. Jennifer Connelly is the Generals' daughter / Bruces' fellow scientist & love interest, the one person capable of getting through to Bruce while he's in Hulk mode.

Director Ang Lee really does try to walk a line here between humanity & emotion and the kind of cartoonish action set pieces that one tends to expect in extravaganzas like this. The result is a movie with its highs and lows, neither great nor terrible but somewhere in between. It really does work best when it focuses on the main characters, their feelings and their dilemmas. I appreciated how it largely portrayed General Ross in an even-handed way, and made David Banner the true villain of the piece - an unhinged man so hellbent on ""improving"" the human species and making discoveries that it blinded him to reason.

Kudos to Lee for his visual treatment, making the picture(s) take on the appearance of comic book panels and making the scene transitions VERY slick. The action is never boring, but is often so ridiculous that it made me laugh. The finale (and the sequence where Hulk demolishes a trio of monster dogs), however, struck me as purely idiotic.

The actors do well, with Nolte a standout as the ultra-determined egghead who keeps setting the story in motion. Bana was good at earning my sympathy, while Josh Lucas is perfectly odious as a stereotyped greedy jerk and Connellys' beauty & appeal are highly welcome.

""Hulk"" really does go on longer than it should have (I wish they'd have left out that entire last act), but it's not hard to see why it would have connected with critics more than the general audience.

Stan Lee has his usual cameo, acting alongside original TV Incredible Hulk Lou Ferrigno. That WAS a fun moment.

Some pretty good stuff.,"I saw Hulk on Friday and I loved the opening sequence, it was great; graphic, and the comic fonts, fantastic. But then it started to go downhill from there. For about half an hour I was seriously thinking ""My goodness, Lee's really lost it."" Then as soon as the Eric Bana and Nick Nolte's relationship started to pick up, I thought; ""Exactly what I was looking for.""

The action of course was unbelievably fantastic. I found myself sitting there for a few moments drewling at the special effects. Even though at some points the Hulk did look slighlty cartoonish; what can you do, when you have to apply an emotive face and expressions along with a giant green muscle man?

The final interaction between Bana and Nolte was brilliant. It was so much like a tragedy; it looked so much like a tragedy infested play, and that was perhaps one of the great factors which drew me into the movie.

Overall, I believe that what grabbed me was how different this film was to others. The comic like split screens, the freeze frames; all of this was brilliant. What makes this film good, is just how different it is to others, as well as other comic book films. I give this film 9 thumbs up. No just joking.

Nice show but rather slow..,"I just watched this movie in cinema yesterday and it basically was a nice show that you have to watch if you're a CGI-graphics fan or a major Marvel fan.

Personally, I felt that the movie was a bit slow in pass and that would at times make you doze off for a few seconds. Also, the CGI-graphics were occasionally a bit too obvious.

Enough negative comments. I thought the movie overall was worth watching and I really enjoyed the camera-techniques used in this movie. Their approach was a bit like done in a comic and comparable to that done in Spider-Man (2002). The story-line was also interesting at some points, but what seriously still puzzles me is: How does Bruce Banner still fit in those pants after he changes into The Hulk??

Not a clue about science or American Comic Book experience,"Ang Lee has great skill in directing and narrating personal relationships. This worked great in the exotically placed Crouching Tiger, especially since he approached it from a young girl's perspective; and it seems that milieu held a special interest for him. But the Hulk is an American pop icon and such should be treated as such: ""give the audience what they want.""

What we were treated to was an unstable balance, like the Bruce Banner/Hulk personality, of summer entertainment and ""high art."" The major film critics ragged on how unreal the Hulk appeared, but I think it was amazing to see a completely CG created monster who thought and interacted with live elements(and bravo for not making him to cute and cuddly). What destroyed the believabilty of this film was the unbelievability of the plot and the lack of empathy with the characters. The secret of every good comic book is to buy the next issue. The film was very caught up in technique and backstory to really let this film take off. In addition, Bruce Banner spends a lot of time in a lab that doesn't appear to be believable. These scenes made me think: ""Wow! that's Jennifer Connely in a lab coat"" or ""Eric Bana looked cooler in Black Hawk Down."" Do a little reasearch on biological science if you're going t obombard the audience with it for half the movie.

It was in essence two movies. One a character driven film and the other a chase film with all the bells and whistles. Bruce Banner's backstory and his relationship to his fathe, Nick Nolte, is so contrived and lame that once again the final showdown at the end is a complete letdown. I don't believe the filmmakers knew how to end the film so gave us a light show. When Spielberg gives us a light show in Raiders or Clos Encounters at least there was meaning behind it.

So, in conclusion, I want to ask that with the size differential between the Hulk and Bruce Banner how come the Hulk's pants fit? If the film was fun I wouldn't have worried about it.",4.0,14 August 2003
Beauty and the Beast (dvd),"This green eye couple leaves me very dubious: I like the drive of Ang Lee that makes him into becoming the Hulk stunt for the motion capture. I like his editing with nice split screens or cuts and it's surprising that no directors got the same idea before (or after)him. The sets and bright, simple colors were artistically done. The beginning in the 50's desert base was similar to Indy IV..

But wait: Hulk a giant? Hulk against dogs? Bruce's father a madman who wants to kill him? Jenny helps Bruce by throwing him in the clutches of the military? I don't know who wrote the script but he never read some Hulk comics. I thought that Hulk was a curse for Bruce (he doesn't want to transform) and that Hulk is blind rage: here, Hulk is just Bruce in anger and a great help to settle things.

"It Was A Disappointment, But It Ain't That Bad","Even though the movie contains some good and famous actors, I didn't really expect any thing much from this movie. And it did turn out right. The movie starts out extremely slow for the comic movie making it very boring at first. And it took more or less quarter of a length of the movie before he turn into a HULK. Then, I meant then it start to be OK. But the way he turn into a HULK is way to simple and very unconvincing.

Anyway after he turns into a HULK the movie started to flow with some acting that are good and interesting. Especially the scene that he fights with 3 hulk dogs and is very intense and somewhat scary. Even though HULK here may look like a rubber doll, I still say it is a very satisfying CGI with all the muscle movement etc. The directing is comic like making it pretty unique comic style.

After all it is a watch able movie, but the truth - it should have been much better, especially the ending.

Handled just TOO seriously,"The recent success of comic movies comes from their serious treatment by studios and directors.

In this case, Ang Lee does a marvellous job of showing us the inside of Bruce Banner's mind, and why he becomes a HULKing rage after a lab accident.

However, as serious as comic treatments need to be, Ang Lee goes totally overboard and forgets that comic movies need to be action movies. The first third of the movie that we spend waiting to see the Hulk really detracts from the rest of the movie.

I will say that when the Hulk is on screen, when compared to the comic books (of which I have hundreds) he is almost 100% dead on. Fans were worried that Lee's interpretation would ruin the Hulk. I don't think this is the case. Lee's only flaw was dragging on the non-Hulk scenes for far too long.

Somewhat Disappointing,"Just quite what the production team were trying to achieve over and above what has already been done with the Hulk rather escaped me. ""Look what we can do with the computer graphics!"" seems to be the theme here, and all I got left thinking was ""Okay, what a shame Lou Feringo didn't want the part..."" Quite a nice story, but of course that was already laid down. I thought the monster was laughable; ET was very much better- and how long ago was that done? It's okay for the kids though, and the acting's okay. It's just a shame about the animations, although I must admit to enjoying the bit where the Hulk gets the better of a pack of nasty dogs. That's about all though. I preferred the original David Banner too, but I suppose it's not the done thing to look much over 30 these days, is it? The rest of the film is okay, just not the Hulk bits, and surely the Hulk is the main point of the film, isn't it? Not a patch on the old 80s TV series, no way.",4.0,7 January 2007
Pretty good actually,"I went into this fearing the worst and I was rather quite surprised. I thought all the so called 'boring' parts were needed both for characterisation and plot development. The way all this is shot keeps it from slowing down to much and before you know it the Hulk is out. Very impressive visually, only spoiled by a lousy ending.

If you're able to get through the slow beginning.. a treat.,"I haven't read of the Hulk comic books, so the beginning of the movie (where we get the background and setup for the rest of the film, of course) was a little bit dull to me, I have to admit. I was really looking for an action film, but in order to keep fans of the comic book series happy (in being faithful to the written version) and also those into mindless big-budget action, I guess both were needed. It'd just be nice if they could've perhaps integrated the two together in a more condusive manner. Regardless, I really did enjoy the later scenes of the film, especially the Helicopter-to-Ground fights. Not a bad film, but the second hour is a lot more enjoyable to those who haven't turned a comic book page in many years, most likely.",6.0,15 November 2003
Very very poor.,"Watching these movie I decided that there is an ever increasinging gap between a film and a comic-book film. The comic-book film is a new medium. To truly understand it, you must be up on thousands of comics, animated cartoons and lots more trivia. You are really playing catch-up if your just an average film fan.

Ok so the Hulk, what can I say what a waste of acting ability and the over-hyped Ang Lee over-hypes his career again. The CGI was poor, it would have been realistic if they would have painted Arnold Schwarznegger green. The split-screen, this only works on 24, but Ang Lee uses it to confuse the audience and to show young directors how not to make a film, ever heard of the 180 degree rule.

Eric Bana brilliant in Black Hawk Down is wasted here, Nicke Nolte is prepared to grunt his way through the movie and the one characters played by Josh Lucas is so one dimensional he could fit underneath the gap at the bottom of doors.

Does Ang Lee specify in boring his audience, first 45 minutes of Crouching Tiger the whole of Ride With The Devil? This is a very poor film, but while there are geeks out their who will see this film 20 times, we better prepare for the sequels. But I don't care I won't be watching them.",4.0,23 June 2003
Uneven,"I admit this film's uneven, but I also feel the reason so many people were turned off by it was the fact that it was trying to be a different kind of superhero film, not the typical ""origin of superhero followed by superhero thwarts super villain and wins the girl"" kind of scenario. Rather, it wanted to dig deep into the recesses of man's mind and see what potential evils lurk about in there. It was a valiant effort, but all for naught.

Eric Bana, who was really cool as a Delta Commando in ""Black Hawk Down"", does what he can with the role of the emotionally repressed Bruce Banner, but he falls a bit flat. They kept building him up to this big emotional outburst but by that point it wasn't him anymore, it was the special effect. Perhaps a better way to have gone with the character would have been to make him an overly emotional man who, after being exposed to the gamma radiation, has to fight to control and suppress his emotions in order to contain the incredible Hulk within. Too bad he said yes to this one of all the projects offered to him, because really he has the right look to be Superman, if you ask me. Nick Nolte seems to be having a ball as Bana's mad scientist dad, and Sam Eliot gives a serviceable performance General Ross. Jennifer Connelly, however, is wasted as the love interest (plus doesn't she look more like Elektra from the Daredevil comics?). Josh Lucas's character is ridiculously jerky and looks like he'd be more at home in an Adam Sandler film (as one reviewer put it). Some of the CGI effects used on teh Hulk are good, but it would have been better if they'd mixed the CGI with giant animatronic robo-Hulks.

Worth a look, but probably not something to buy and watch over and over again. Here's hoping Eric Bana has more luck with playing Prince Hector in ""Troy"".",,6 January 2004
"Hulk Smash, but not Smash Hit","Well, I rated this film a 7 of 10. I am a comic book collector. That half of me did not enjoy the film, like it wanted to, the other half of me realizes that non-comic book fans have a greater possibility of enjoying this film. First, let me say that despite reservations concerning the CGI Hulk, I was impressed with the 'Hulk' scenes... they really did strike a chord with the side of me that likes to throw temper tantrums when I don't get my way. Several of the scenes were quite impressive not only in their execution but also with the approach Lee took in filming the scene. I also thought the acting was OK. Not distracting, but added to the overly long and at times boring screenplay, the performances loose their luster, and you

start to look for flaws. I think that a lot of times when a movie doesn't keep you attention, people will tend to drift and find flaws that really aren't that important, and when a film is really boring in parts, we tend to find a lot of them as we aimlessly wander over the screen... I think this is what happened to the Hulk, and I would discourage any parents from taking any attention-challenged children to this show... they will bore easily.",7.0,23 June 2003
More TALK than SMASH!,"As a Hulk fan, I expected The Hulk to be on par like the rest of the recent super-hero action flicks one example ""DareDevil"" but came up a little short as far as timing. I understand they had to explain the story of Hulk but the beginning started out a drag and lasted all the way until finally in the middle of the movie where the comic book action at last kicked into gear. Just like the first ""X-men"" movie where they had to explain the existence for a handful of characters but in the Hulk this is one man for crying out loud, get to the action already! For the CGI, the Hulk does indeed look convincingly real. I'm glad they decided to go with this perspective rather than try to fit some pro-wrestler into a muscle suit or use green body paint, phew what a disaster that would've been. The action was just like I expected, right out of the comic book, very Hulk-like intensity, Hulk breaking and smashing things to pummeling evil villains to bits. The movie itself reads just like a comic book, showing dream sequences to split-screens to the dramatic positioning of the characters. I give applaud to Ang Lee and the crew for doing their homework. Like I said before, the only thing I hated was waiting for the Hulk to come alive, and it took way too long. Hopefully the sequel will be more exciting with a super evil villain for Hulk to play with. I'm a huge Hulk fan and I know this is just the start but overall 6/10.",6.0,20 June 2003
"Not bad, but not great either","Why, oh lord why, did Ang Lee get to direct this? Even Wes Craven would have been better. If Ang Lee had spent more money on CGI instead of all those stupid, creative camera cuts, then maybe the Hulk would have looked halfway real. Better yet, get a real actor to play the Hulk. I know that the Hulk is supposed to be as big as a house, but camera tricks and blue screen effects could have taken care of that.

Computer animation was a real detriment to the movie. The Hulk looked like a cartoon, and the dogs were even worse (although the fight scene where he beats the dogs down was really cool). If you wanted a computer animated Hulk, why not just make this an entirely computer animated movie? At least then everything around the Hulk would have looked equally crappy.

Since when was the Absorbing Man Bruce Banner's father? I don't mind if they don't follow the comic books, but Crusher Creel was the Absorbing Man, and that made more sense. At least then they could have a cool enemy for any Hulk sequels. I pray every hour that they never use the Leader bad guy. Just think of how terrible his CGI would look.

Aside from god-awful direction and lousy special effects, the movie has a good plot, good action scenes and really good acting. I'd really like to give this movie a grade of B+ for all the good parts, but they simply weren't enough to make up for the terrible camera cuts. So this gets a B- instead. For the sequel, get a real director.",3.0,21 June 2003
Comic book adaptation overflow!,"What do we ""realistic"" Europeans expect from a movie like ""Hulk""? We want to see a little drama, nice action and some ""realism"" too. We do know from the start we won't be intellectual challenged when watching it. This project has been waiting on the shelf 'till one Ang Lee decides to take it all the way: the movie has a comic book feeling with all the moving screens which is ok; it works for this one. A strong cast does the job and yes the special effects look REAL to me and many others. Making a giant green monster look real(human)isn't an easy job but it's been done quite well here. I am positive about this movie, but I can't say it's fantastic(see for yourself). Maybe we get to see too much MARVEL adaptations these days, because the logo in the beginning starts to look very familiar... Still good for a nice 7 I believe.",7.0,28 June 2003
"A rewritten, convoluted mess","I had read some bad reviews of the Hulk film before I watched it. Ang Lee is one of my favorite directors (I loved the English Patient and Crouching Tiger) so I assumed he had added some intelligence and lyricism to the Hulk, and perhaps that was turning off some of the comic book film reviewers. In any case, I really wanted to see this film, just to see what Ang Lee would do with the material.

If you feel the same way, I entreat you: don't bother watching The Hulk! For every interesting scene or technique Ang Lee presents, there are a dozen frustrations. This movie wasn't just bad, it was sometimes infuriating.

The ""story"" was by James Schamus, a long-time Ang Lee collaborator and, I'm guessing, not much of a comic book fan. The premise of the original Hulk was simple and powerful: a wimpy scientist with qualms about making weapons gets caught in the blast radius of a Gamma bomb and turns into the Hulk whenever anger overcomes him. In this film Schamus alienates every Hulk fan with a cliché and convoluted new backstory involving a lunatic father, microbiological ""nanomeds"", a family tragedy, reptile experiments, and a poorly contrived Gamma radiation lab accident. To make matters worse Banner's Hulk transformation is now caused by ""repressed memories,"" not anger! Ridiculous scenes follow. At first Banner transforms because of a phone message he hears (that triggers a memory). Later Banner gets beaten and tasered by a bad guy, and he won't transform! They have to resort to a crazy underwater psychological experiment to trigger a repressed memory so he can transform.

Stan Lee and the Marvel comics guys crafted some great, classic stories. The Spiderman films show that being essentially true to these stories can lead to great films. Ang Lee and James Schamus must not have understood the original story, or thought they could do better, and they created an incoherent mess instead.

That said, Ang Lee's talents were not completely misused. The film is not 100% bad.

What worked: The split-screen montages are the best approximation of comic book panel pacing that I've seen. The CGI model of the Hulk is awesome, with great musculature. The bounding-through-the-desert scenes are liberating, especially after the plodding pace of the rest of the film. Occasional flashes of good acting come from Sam Elliott and Jennifer Connelly.

What didn't work: The lame new Hulk origin story. About 100 obvious holes in the story continuity (such as: Hulk destroys the research lab, but then a day later the evil Dad gets into the now clean, non-destroyed lab and uses it for his own purposes). The Hulk's skin texture maps: all the layering and work that went into making them realistic was wasted because of the neon green coloring. The extreme darkness of many of the action scenes makes it impossible to know what's going on.

The list of bad stuff could be longer, but I'll stop there.

If you watch this on DVD you can get some clues about why this film went so wrong. In Ang Lee's commentary he says that his wife has been a molecular biologist for years, and biology labs ""are what I know""-- so you can see how the forced biology and ""nanomeds"" elements in the story came about. Lee also describes, almost proudly, how he came up with some of the ""pseudo-science"" that made the story so nonsensical. I guess he doesn't realize that comic and sci-fi movie fans want their pseudo-science plausible and coherent. He talks about how costly it was to build a log cabin all the way up in Sequoia National Park--for a 10-second scene where the setting was not even important. Did the film's investors know how much money was being squandered this way? Has Lee's artistic ego gotten the best of his judgment?

You also learn that James Schamus is credited as Producer/Story/Screenwriter, and that there were two other screenwriters added later, one of whom is a comic book fan. When a Producer writes the script, you can bet that story editing is going to be thin (who wants to cross the producer?). The comic book fan was probably brought in to fix some of the most egregious holes in the story, but it was too little too late.

I'm afraid I can't recommend this film to anyone except film students who want to learn how NOT to make a comic book inspired movie.",3.0,24 October 2004

Merely ok...,"Ang Lee is a very talented director, and Jennifer Connelly and Eric Bana rarely choose poor projects to be involved in, but the end result of Hulk is a bit of a mixed bag.

When it comes to movies, action and special effects are completely secondary for me, so I was excited to hear that Lee had chosen to develop the dramatic instead of dumb down the movie for 12 year olds. I want a intriguing and involving story, and interesting characters that grow. Maybe my expectations were a bit high, and maybe I forgot how Ang Lee can confuse boredom for character development (anyone see Ride with the Devil?).

I thought the last 1/3rd to 1/4th of the movie was pretty good, lots of revelations and an over the top feel that is true to the comic book style. I thought the bright, comic book colored motif and the frame and panel camera effects were some of the most original and entertaining elements of the movie. But most of the first half of the movie is extremely boring. Too much stale dialogue and too many random events that don't contribute to the story or character development.

I gave Spiderman 4/10, so I had to go one notch lower for this one. I actually thought the effects were better in Hulk than in Spidey, but overall the movie was just LONG and DULL and inferior. I enjoyed the helicopter battle out in the desert, but everything else was just boring. I'm all for character development (which I felt Spiderman was completely lacking), but there is little or none of it here. Just endless, droning dialogue.

I don't think enough was made of the fact that as he gets more angry, the Hulk gets more powerful. I've read that the Hulk once lifted an entire mountain, but here he just plays with tanks and has trouble killing a few mutant dogs. When I think Hulk, I guess I just think bigger. Like Hulk vs. 200 tanks, not 3 or 4. Or Hulk vs. a squadron of fighter jets, not just 2 or 3. Too bad.",3.0,1 June 2004

And when a movie is about to be made of one of them, fans alike all hope that it will be done with a certain dignity to the origin and sustenance of the character. Has anyone heard of Bryan Singer? Sam Raimi? Hello? These guys have been true to the characters and to the fans! Saturday, my patience with Ang Lee was worn out! I can't believe Marvel released this crap. The CGI Effects were terrible! I think we should get the guy who used to do the ""Mr. Bill"" claymation show for SNL to do it next time. It would look better.

Surprisingly Good,"I just got back from watching an AM showing of Hulk on June 20th, Friday, and i must say i was impressed with this movie. It's not your usual mindless action summer blockbuster. There is nice depth to the story and plenty of character development. The Hulk has limited screen time, which is nice, so we don't get sick of watching him too much. There have been people complaining the CGI effects dont look very well, but they do look a whole lot better in the theatre than they did in the trailers. And yes, there are times when the Hulk doesnt look real, but then it is a comic book movie, and you have to take certain liberties when watching such a movie. The movie has many emotionally powerful scenes (scenes that the x-men movies and spiderman lacked, but needed). On a whole i enjoyed this more than the before mentioned films, though i did enjoy them. I want a good script along with good CGI effects in a movie, and this delivers enough of both to be very enjoyable.

Boring and extremely disappointing,"The Hulk: 5/10

A hyped up movie, and a very disappointing one. I wanted to like The Hulk, but found myself outright bored. As a self-admitted fan of seeing special FX movies once, I thought I'd dig this, but nope. The first hour was spent building up to the inevitable ""Hulking Out"" of Bruce Banner. The build-up might have been fine if it wasn't so dry and if a wooden, beyond boring Eric Bana wasn't in the lead role. The movie picked up with the action scenes, which is all it's really good for, but other than one particular sequence in the desert/mountains, even some of those were flat (especially when he fought a bunch of pumped up dogs). The best actor was Nick Nolte as Bruce Banner's dad, and he played a convincing role as the somewhat nutty ex-scientist. Everyone else bored me. One of the coolest parts of the movie was a guest cameo by Lou Ferrigno (who played a security guard, passed Banner and said ""hey"" in his only appearance of the flick), which was a nice ""inside"" touch. Special mention goes out to a hilariously bad and contrived ending, which may set up a sequel if this does well. The trailer looked great, but the movie was boring overall, and 137 minutes was waaay too long. I just wanted it to end.",5.0,4 July 2003
Could Have Been Better...,"As far as the action and how the movie was presented, I would give two thumbs up. Sadly, that's where the thumbs up ends.

Lost opportunity,"I like Ang Lee. He's an intelligent director. So I was looking forward to ""Hulk"". But I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's OK - and certainly better than most recent comic book adaptations (such as ""Spiderman""). But he seems to have produced a film that is neither one thing or another.

""Hulk"" is an odd mix of adult characterisation and childish action flick. I wish he had tried to produce a film for adults - and fully developed the ""angry man"" theme. But instead, he does a bit of characterisation, some action stuff and a little romance - which doesn't hit the spot on any count.

On the plus side, the comic-book effects are original and very effective. But this movie will be quickly forgotten.

A wasted opprtunity.",5.0,20 July 2003
A film with no home,"For me HULK was somewhat of a letdown even though I couldn't admit it until several years after seeing it. I am a fan of the character and the very theme of dual natures striving for supremacy in a person as well as the exhilaration of throwing civilized inhibition to the wind and going for a mindless rampage. The problem with this film is that it tries to be so deep and human in these themes that it loses balance because the hulk sequences feel like an afterthought and the drama of Banner's turmoil is not dealt with very well at all.

The build up to the first transformation is nothing short of boring. Bruce Banner is supposed to be a distant guy but he comes across as two-dimensional. I have fond memories of watching Eric Bana on Australian TV and in the filmic masterpiece that is CHOPPER but in HULK he seems bored and confused with the material. His lines are delivered very flatly and all complexity in the character is gone. To me, Bruce Banner/the Hulk is a modern Jekyll and Hyde and the Hulk is the engine of destruction through which Banner's darkest feelings of hurt and rage can burst forth loose his demons upon the world. It is a shame then that when the Hulk is unleashed he comes across as an afterthought. The rampages seem really tacked on. They look awesome for the most part but you don't get the feeling of a manifest personal demon taking revenge on a harsh world, you see a direction-less blob of CGI doing stuff that looks cool for the camera. This would have been fine if it wasn't so jarring to the pace of the film, which needs a good kick in the tail pipe. Personally I blame Ang Lee. Hulk is a drama and is supposed to be but the sterile character direction and development, along with the painful dialogue and stagy flashbacks that should have been very personal and harrowing but instead came across as sterile and storybook make for a slow burn that is resolved with abrupt disappointment. The end of the film is awful. Nothing is resolved, there is an ugly, bland and unfathomably abstract battle with a villain that is a mockery of it's original comic book counterpart (Absorbing Man) and you are left feeling as though the last pages of the script were written in a mad rush to finish a film that wasn't heading anywhere to begin with.

Ang Lee has a great art-house drama kind of sensibility that has created some beautiful films but in the context of HULK it comes across as totally sterile. The abstract desert imagery spliced with CGI jellyfish and other such puzzlements add nothing but pretension to a film that should have been kept simple. In blending art with pulp we are left with a mess that could have been polished into something both entertaining and thought provoking but was sadly left as a mess.

I give this film a 6 for ambition, some nice CGI and action sequences (although they're better watched separate from the rest of the film), some fair performances (particularly from the lovely and talented Jennifer Connely) and for the fact that it tries to take the bland genre of comic book movies into a new direction but unfortunately it failed to do so. It is hard to explain why this film felt so awkward and wrong so i suggest all who are curious just see it and make up your own minds.",6.0,22 January 2006
Boring movie that is disconnected from the original story,"The stroy line was poor and disconnected form the original stroy.

In tis movie the special effects are so obvious and I was not impressed! The Hulk looked like a computer image and he did not seem real! The only part that connected with the old series is when Banner meets Mr McGee.

In all my wife and I did not like this series. We both found Lou Ferigno more believable as the Hulk! At least he had a part in this movie.

A Film Bound By Its Own Genre...,"Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" is a film that's so good, so well acted, so well written, and so engaging that I found myself constantly wishing that it wasn't centered on a silly green superhero. ""The Hulk"" is a film that puts all the recent comic adaptations to shame (""Spider-Man"" and ""Daredevil""), and is definitely the best superhero movie since Tim Burton's ""Batman.""

So why has this film been receiving such poor press? Why are so many people on this site bashing everything from the script to the CGI? It's simple really: American anti-intellectualism. Those that liked ""Spider-Man"" enjoyed it for the exact reasons intelligent people hated it--it was hollow, predictable, had no real suspense or character development, was flat and tawdry, and the action seemed crammed in just to keep the ignorant from being bored. Some claim that it was this fluff, this lack-of-seriousness, that made the movie ""great"": it treated the material as a comic book movie should be treated. In a way, I agree with this way of thinking, but only with a comic character like ""Spider-Man"" would this work: he's a superhero that, unlike the Hulk, has no dimension. He's a silly and flat character, and in a way, that should translate into a silly and flat movie (which it did). This is not to say that ""Spider-Man"" couldn't be better, because I feel it could have in a million ways. Hulk, on the other hand, isn't a good guy that fights crime day and night--he's far more complex and interesting. He's probably more bad than good, because his uncontrollable rages result in unprecedented destruction. Instead of simply catering to morons by having the movie be non-stop smashing, Ang Lee and his screenwriter James Schamus decided to research the character and create a film more about his struggle than his tumultuous panics. This care for the character Bruce Banner, his background, and his life shine through every frame, and this creates a sensation that's very rare in comic flicks.

Yet even Ang Lee, art-house master, knows that a summer comic blockbuster wouldn't be complete without some serious action, and the final action sequences are the most stunning and visually imaginative since Ang Lee's own ""Crouching Tiger."" In one scene, the Hulk, who can jump miles, jumps from a rocky canyon region to a silent desert while loads of planes and helicopters pursue him, trying to blow him to green sludge. For a moment, as he lands in this serene desert, he has lost his enemies, and he softly tumbles down a sandy hill. In the background we can hear the oncoming bombing assault. It's scenes like this that made ""The Hulk"" so enjoyable, fresh, and ingenious. Ang Lee only gives us action after he has invested our care into his characters, and it means so much more then the boring action scenes performed in ""Spider-Man.""

As far as the acting goes, it's top-notch for sure. Some claim that while Eric Bana under-acts, both Nick Nolte and Sam Elliott overact. Personally, I think this goes against the theory that comic films should be fun--overacting is what it's all about. Nick Nolte was so effectively creepy and bizarre that for me he carried the movie. Jennifer Connelly was beautiful and touching, and when the film was over she had made more of a mark than other actresses in recent action films that sit and weep on the sidelines. Sam Elliott was purely captivating, and for the first time in years captured the difficult decisions and emotions that are inherent in the military field within a very miniscule timeframe. And finally, Eric Bana, as Bruce Banner: I felt his performance was just what it should have been. He didn't try to steal the show from his green counterpart, and he stayed true to the original Marvel Bruce Banner: calm, reserved and shy (which obviously creates a parallel to Hulk). Schamus's script investigated more emotion and motivation behind the Hulk than any superhero film I think I've ever seen: and it's this serious tone that makes the movie so above and beyond the rest. This doesn't ruin the film at all (as some say), but just makes the movie that much more fascinating.

As far as the graphics go, I felt that they were FAR better than that of ""Spider-Man"" (where I was distracted by how bad the effects were). You can see just how difficult it must have been to create the hulk character, and the way he doesn't just appear but also interacts with his environment is great. Yes, there were times during action scenes were he seemed to be made of silly putty, but they never got as flawed as in ""Spider-Man.""

And finally, Ang Lee's hold on the film is crucial: the way he films it mimes a comic the entire time: wide angles and vibrant frames, and the editing swipes/fades/dissolves/ and split screens really recreate this sensation of turning the pages of a comic (I'm sure the creators of both of the last comic films wish they had thought of this). Great stuff.

In the end the movie had a great blend of seriousness and hokeyness, and made a far greater impression than any of the competition. Although it wasn't a great movie, it was a great action movie. I do feel that it was a film that was so good it felt limited by it's own source material, but that's complimentary.",10.0,25 June 2003
Ang Lee is boring as usual.,"HULK is a good movie. Though, it is NOT because of Ang Lee.

The film starts out with a boring 40 minutes of characterizations, which could have been cut down to about half that time (and probably still be boring). This stuff is needed to understand the story and to get interesting characters, one might say, but that is totally wrong. The characters are not interesting, except for Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) who is at least a little bit interesting.

However, when Bruce Banner becomes HULK the first time, the film lifts a bit, but that is only because the computer animations are so similar to the comic itself. HULK moves, feels, looks and acts like HULK should. This is very good.

However, all live-action is boring as hell, and the story line could have been better. Ang Lee's directions are sleepy and tiresome. If it wasn't for the CGI this film would've been a total flop. And I usually hate CGI.

I gave it 6 out of 10. HULK is cool and demolish things in fun ways.

I want the last two hours of my life back...,"I am pretty sure I have seen a movie that was worse, but I am hard-pressed to come up with one... let's put it this way: I DON'T register for any site that makes me fill out more than a user name and a password, but I gritted my teeth and waded through the IMDb registration simply so I could post my disgust. Slow story development that still left me scratching my head over some of the actions and motivations of the characters, barely a shred of the Hulk or the comic book bearing his name recognizable in the movie, all leading up to a terrible 'climactic' showdown between Hulk and his... nemesis? I will echo some of the other posters that said the camera work was interesting, and I always like to see a movie with Sam Elliot (the only nice surprise that this movie held for me), but after sitting through minute after minute of this movie in the vain hope that something would happen to justify the time I was wasting, all I can do is feel thankful that my roommate is the one who wasted his Netflix slot on this piece of dreck.",1.0,14 June 2005

"More poetic, but also rougher around the edges","This movie is in some ways ugly, in some ways beautiful. Well, maybe not quite beautiful, but there's some art and depth to it, it's just not very polished. Could have used a rewrite, some better visual effects, and a better DP. Also a better cast would have helped. Some of the acting is good, but - without naming names - there are a few poor casting choices in there. In some ways, it feels like a TV movie. A bit rushed, a bit shoddy-looking, and ""not quite there"", but it has some heart to it. There are some clever ideas, some emotional depth and poetry to this movie, but I can't help but feel like it could have come together a bit better.

In comparison to the 2008 Marvel Studios version, it wins in some respects and loses in others. The 2008 film looked better, and had a more fun-to-watch Banner, but its Hulk was just anticlimactic instead of cathartic. This one has some of the same issues, but is slightly more balanced in making Banner and the Hulk feel a bit more like parts of the same character. Not to anywhere near the glorious extent to which it was accomplished in 2012's ""The Avengers"", but closer than 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"" in my opinion.

I also felt like we got to spend more time with Edward Norton's Banner than Eric Bana's, but on the other hand, Ang Lee manages to tell us a lot about Bruce Banner's psychology without using too much overtly expository dialogue to do it. In some cases, it works, and in others it doesn't. Some things are conveyed beautifully through subtext and symbolism, while others are straight up shown in overt and clunky flashback. ""Show don't tell"" is occasionally taken a little too literally in this film, jumping back and forth between subtle and on- the-nose.

One thing that bothered me was the editing. I get the idea; Ang Lee is excited to be making a comic book movie, so he wants to make nods to the fact that it's a comic book movie by using comic panel-like transitions, which ultimately just ends up looking tacky and unprofessional. It's a cute idea, but it doesn't really work, as it takes the viewer out of the story and goes ""HEY LOOK IT'S A COMIC BOOK MOVIE I'M MAKING A COMIC BOOK MOVIE COOL HUH YEAH I THOUGHT SO"". It reminds me of that episode of The Simpsons where Homer starts editing home videos and puts star wipes everywhere. We get it, Ang Lee, you're making a comic book movie, you don't have to rub our noses in it. Unfortunately, this along with the lighting, photography and goofy-looking Hulk design adds to the aforementioned made-for-TV look of the piece.

The dialogue also ranges between bland and poetic, but luckily never idiotic (although perhaps somewhat melodramatic in places).

Danny Elfman's music is as usual inventive, strange and heavily percussive, and really adds to the pile of good things about this movie. Also a lot of Eastern influences are present, in somewhat more obvious ways than most of his other comic book movie soundtracks.

Thematically, where 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"" is mostly about self- control, this movie is about anger. Not about controlling anger, not about embracing it, but about anger itself. It's an exploration of a state of mind. In some ways, it works. In other ways, it's a mess. This movie is not stupid. Nor is it necessarily bad. It's very uneven, and a bit ugly, but it has some artistic value, as it's a fairly interesting exploration of the Hulk concept and the Bruce Banner character. It's a very different comic book movie, and definitely worth checking out; just don't expect perfection or a typical action comic book flick.

This is a confused movie, unsure of whether it wants to be an action movie or an art house film, and perhaps that represents the duality of Dr. Banner himself. Too bad the action aspects simply didn't work.

Given a bit more time and creative support, this movie could probably have been something very special. As it is, it's an experiment that didn't quite work out as planned, but had some somewhat interesting results. Much like the Hulk himself.",6.0,30 April 2012
depends on how you look at it...,"Well, first I liked it. I really did. May be because of that ""temper-struggeling theme"" (like ""The Shining""), but now...

...I really don't care about the movie. I think it's OK, nothing special; and the special effects aren't great - the Hulk looks like just another drawn character. But it isn't the worst movie, it's just average.

And there's Eric Bana. Well, first I thought he was OK. He did OK in the movie as well, but the big turn off came when he starred in ""Troy"" - that really bad movie. Both historically/mythologically wrong and just bad when it comes to acting, scenery... and it's just laugh-making.

Addressing many issues...,"The idea of having a thinking mans comic book movie is a good one, and it should of worked. The problem with this attempt by Ang Lee is triple fold, though...

First off, The extremely tragic and dramatic story line and direction just don't mesh well with the over the top comic book editing and (sometimes cheesy)""mood enhancing"" effects. i.e. the music and the lighting.

Second, we have a very poor script that stretches too long, and looses all semblance of coherency in the last twenty minutes. The style and ideas were good, but the execution was very poor. The dramatic style could have fit perfectly with a by the numbers origins of the hulk storyline, and the dialog did not have be so cheesy. At times it felt very forced and unnatural.

Third, The acting. I like every actor in this movie. The problem is, most of them had no place being in this movie. Eric Bana is good as a cardboard cutout type of character. This particular movie, though, required a little more. Connelly is a great actress, but seemed like she herself thought she was out of place as Betty Ross, and that threw her character for me. THe only actor i really felt fit well was Sam Niel, who plays his role perfectly, balancing the hard ass military man with the concerned father, and really bringing to life that struggle.

Furthermore, i would have liked to see a more complete villain, with a more complete final fight. David Banner is just a weird amalgamation of different hulk villains, with no real coherency, and the battle of these super foes is very brief and literally just stops. There is no final blow, there is no epic battle, there is just ""ehhh...its over"" At the end of a comic book film, this is the make or break or point. Fans can accept a bad movie, if the final battle is worth the wait, but most viewers judge the entire movie on that final payoff, and if its not there, as it was not in this film, than we feel cheated.",4.0,28 May 2008
Should have been more emotional,"I wish I could give this film a higher rating.

When I was little I loved the Hulk, watching every episode without fail. I was a bit of a tomboy, but not so much that I read superhero comics, and I probably wasn't even aware of the Hulk's origins. And now I love comic book films. Sin City blew me away, both Spiderman films have thoroughly entertained me, and Batman Begins is just fantastic. So when they made the Hulk with Eric Bana, probably my favourite actor since seeing Chopper years ago, I thought I was on to a winner.

At the end of every episode of the Hulk I cried my eyes out. Dr Banner's life was so tragic, it was a bit like a more intelligent 'Littlest Hobo' (LOL). Every week you would hope that he could start over again and have a normal life, but by the end he would have to move on, and it broke my heart every time.

So the film should have at least made me feel some emotion, even just a little choked up!

If they do make a sequel that's the one thing they need to concentrate on, making everyone weep like little girls by then end.",6.0,28 October 2005

"A Stylistic, Dark Story","The Hulk isn't really a super-hero movie, since the Hulk can't really be classified as either a super-hero or -villain. He's just super-human. As such I feel the reason some people didn't like this film came from the reason that Hulk didn't duke it out with another spandex-wearing hero from Marvel, like Captain America. But that's just it, Hulk is not a super-hero, his story has less to do with epic battles than it does with an idea. The Hulk is an allegory for uncontrolled rage.

This is why I love the film. It's very human, very real in spite of its fantasy origins. The Hulk is something magnificent, yet at the same time something very human and tragic. The film has a weird Zen feel to it which may be due to director Ang Lee. Also the narrative, with its comic-book like cuts does manage to capture the feel of a comic-book quite well.

Though the performances at the very beginning of the film were not as impressive as those later in the film, everything in the film is luckily so grounded that it didn't bother me that much. What it manages to do is capture the essence of what The Hulk is about. This is why I like it very much the same way I liked X-Men and why I disliked Spider-Man.

Just plain awful.,"Eric Bana gets a bad case of Syphilis as Ang Lee attempts to inject art into a Hollywood blockbuster, and fails miserably.

This is a dire movie. The first hour is excruciatingly boring. And the constant split screens are headache-inducing. Split screens, screens merging into one, etc. look pretty good, and can be great if used sparingly and appropriately. However, in this movie they pop up every few seconds, like the opening credits of the old TV show ""Dallas"". Apparently these are here to try to distract the viewer from the complete absence of plot or anything even remotely resembling one.

Eric Bana is a terrible actor, so wooden he makes Keanu Reeves look like Orson Welles. The movie also manages to waste good actors like Sam Elliot, Nick Nolte and Jennifer Connelly - not only that, but their acting is pretty awful in this movie too.

It is very rare that I walk out of a movie before it is over, but this one has me racing for the door, and breathing a sigh of relief once I had escaped it.

Don't do it! Don't waste your time or money on this garbage!,"There are a few comments here that indicate this film is very poor. I don't think it is possible to state just how bad this film is. Let's just say that if you decide to suspend reality for a bit in order to enjoy the film (as we all do at times for film), you will start to think very quickly in this film that the stupidity of those characters that are supposed to be thinking logically will leave you with no interest at all in what happens to any of them. The Hulk can jump higher and farther than any military vehicle within range of striking him, so why do they stupidly cruise in to take their shot as if nobody briefed them on their target? There are constantly people doing the most idiotic things, and as I said, you just wish for it to end (the film) so that you can groan for one last time about how awful it is, and then get on with your life. Thank God I did not spend any money on this film and I only watched the whole thing so that I could be sure about my opinion.

One last thought. I was thinking about the production of films like this, and I realized that many of the actors would have had no idea what the film would be like under long after they contributed their parts (acting in front of green screens and such so that the CGI can be laid down long afterwards). Given that, can you imagine how some of these actors must have felt when viewing this for the first time? I am sure their expectations were that this film would be the quality of Superman, or some other comic book inspired film with today's amazing computer graphics that are available. If I had my name associated with this crap and only found out about it post-production, I am sure I would write an open letter as an apology to any fans that may have seen the film. Really, it is *THAT* bad!",,14 June 2004

Hulk the anti-hero.,,6.0,31 July 2003
Interesting failure,"This movie is definitely a failure. It lacks in so many ways! But it's indeed a very interesting failure.

The acting direction is almost non-existent, the actors are apparently reading their lines while shooting thus we have flat 2-dimensional characters, except for Nick Nolte's one (good work). Sam Elliot is OK but he's quite self-mimicking. Anyway casting Eric Bana as the Hulk was quite a poor decision.

I bet Ang Lee was NOT directing the actors at an early stage. I know he is a very good acting director (""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman"" and ""The Ice storm"" are great proofs). I'm even suspecting Lee was called at the last minute, to save this movie from total disaster, when the producers saw the appalling shooting material they would have to make a movie with.

The storyline... well it's a comix adaptation, OK, but what a dull screenplay these guys came up with! It's even confusing at times, and seems to have no unity. Some holes, too.

A failure, for sure. But a very interesting one. Because Ang Lee introduced (probably in an attempt to enhance the poor shooting work) all sorts of cool, cinematic, jubilating stuff at the post-prod stage. We have creative/dynamic editing, split screens, dreams presented as reality... all of this is clever, intelligent, engaging moviemaking that brilliantly reflects the comix universe's ""feel"". And I bet Lee was responsible for the outdoors scenes with the Hulk, that are outstanding in terms of space and movement. The CGI imagery during the father/son fight is really impressive too, and some shots look like what some scenes in X-2 should have been.

And (at last!), a really GOOD musical score for a super-hero blockbuster. Elfman gives us one of his finest ""mainstream movies"" jobs. Not as outstanding than his works for more alternative/arty movies of course, but this is definietly the best score of all the recent mainstream blockbusters.

So we have this half-baked flick. Some quite outstanding, jubilating cinematic features over a cheap-TV-series-like screenplay and shooting. Strange object. To my ""don't know what to do with it"" pile. I can't even rate this one.

Imagine this editing/post-prod style with a good story, good acting and a good director in charge right from the start. Woaw. I'd LOVE that.",5.0,8 December 2003
What doesn't kill him makes him stronger,"I remember watching the TV series The Incredible Hulk back in the 80's and enjoying it quite a lot. In that series, Bill Bixby played Bruce Banner and Lou Ferrigno portrayed the mad Banner a.k.a. the Hulk. The Incredible Hulk was one of the 'few' superhero series I watched when I was a child. I tuned into X-Men a couple of times, I watched Spider Man when I was in my late teens and when I was smaller I watched The Incredible Hulk and the Batman series made in the 60's (maybe The Avengers too if you count them as superheroes). I did not know it or realize it back then, but I always preferred the Marvel superheroes over Batman. Spider-Man was my favorite, then probably the Hulk and then the X-Men, so when Hollywood started making feature films featuring all the superheroes I'd seen as a child, I started to going to the cinema to see them in their new glory. Blade was OK, I loved X-Men, I was very not sure whether Spider-Man would work and I got blown away in the cinema, I felt Blade 2 was good, X2 was a good sequel and since I neither knew Daredevil nor liked the idea of Ben Affleck as a superhero (in pink leather???) I stayed away from him. Knowing the Hulk and having seen Eric Bana in Chopper, I thought I'd pay him a visit, if only for old times sake. Mind you though, that I expected even less of this film than I did of Spider-Man. I did not expect anything but a mediocre film, due to the reviews I'd read and the trailers I'd seen. Why go to see it then? Because I liked the Hulk it when I was a child and because I was curious about what my green friends big screen outing would be like.

Well first of all I can say that I was not disappointed with Hulk. It is a pretty decent film overall, though it has it's flaws. The major flaws of this film, in my opinion, were the action scenes. Not due to crappy computer animation, or because I'd rather seen a guy with green paint on him, but because I thought they lasted too long at times. Not all action sequences were bad though, just the ones involving the military near the ending of the film. The scenes just dragged on too long and didn't make much sense to me, except wasting ammunition. The government / military was overused and too bad without any cruel bad guy being in hand's reach. Also they were plain and simple stupid. Since when is shooting at someone considered soothing? One big point for Ang Lee in this film though. The scene in which David Banner (Nick Nolte) talks to Dr.Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) in her apartment is simply breathtaking. Well done Mr.Lee, you've managed to capture the essence of most Marvel comics: personal tragedy or trauma. Besides that incredible peak there, the long and sometimes boring action sequences and the overlong ending, the film is pretty solid. Lengthy ending + emotional highpoint + overlong and sometimes boring action sequences + solidity >

C'mon, give it its due. Its a comicbook brought to life, and it was entertaining in the end. The characters were way more believable than Daredevil. Overall, not as good as X-men, and almost on par with Spidey. The action scenes really rocked! Unfortunately, you did have to live through the long character development scenes to get there.

"Me Hulk, Me Angry-For Heaven's Sake!","I was actually against writing a review for the little Hulk, but I change my mind considering the fact that I haven't written a review on a movie for which I have similar feelings. I'm talking about another super-hero based film, Spider-Man. I was so disappointed to see Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man as I was to see Jennifer Connelly in this. You know, all super-hero movies, or almost all, are the same. You've seen one you've seen them all one might say. Can't disagree. Of course, X-Men 2 was a great surprise, but I doubt Spidey 2 or a rumored Hulk 2 will also be.

This thing of a movie is actually pathetic when it comes to theory. It would've been great if there would've been less talking and more action. Actually it was just enough action. Stick just with the ""less talking"" part. Every sentence that came from any of the actors seemed such a cliche. The action was pretty good though, nice effects and all, but that doesn't make a good movie. The story is largely predictable and I advise you to go to the movie with a friend you haven't spoken with for a long time. If you do so you can easily catch up with what's been happening during the ""talking frames"".

This movie doesn't have any charm and even though the beginning was quite interesting it all went to hell once the character know as Bruce's dad appeared. He is really uninteresting and pathetic. Exactly as the father-general. Two characters will lack any depth. Even though it's over two hours of material you hardly get to see a solidly built character. There were a lot of scenes in which the screen was split; reminded me of a game, but my friend told me a smart thing: looks like a comic book. Actually it did. Nice effect? Hard to say. Didn't bring anything enchanting in the movie. The most laughable scene, visually, was the one in which Talbot died, being out rendered in a blow-up scene. Sorry, not for me.

A solid 6, if not a 5.5. Not much of a good movie, but still better than Charlie's Angels:Full Throttle. I don't know to whom to recommend it. Probably only to the people who've been waiting for it. And I guess those have already seen it.",6.0,5 September 2003
"Disappointing. I Want to like it, I still don't.","My Take: An artsy but fatally flawed comic book adaptation.

At first, ""Hulk"" sounds like a hell of an a idea. At first watch, I didn't like it, so I repeatedly watched it. And even so, I still didn't. It still has so much CGI and fancy shots, but very little amounts of story and more clearer explanation of events. Don't get me wrong, Ang Lee is a great director, but he didn't do things right with this. Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Nick Nolte, Sam Elliot and Josh Lucas offers some fine performances, but still couldn't uplift this mess of a film. My suggestion for improvements, it's simple really. Less Effects, more story. The special-effects are admittedly great, but it has too much that what the film requires. The effects are too abundant, they had less room for more story ideas. Other pros include a great casting and some fine cinematography. Other weaknesses include poor direction and lack of story.

Trust me, as far as it could have been, it could have sounded so much better than a green brute going on a rampage, it would have been a more interesting summer blockbuster.

Rage. Power. Freedom. The inner beast has been released!,"Another comic book character is now appearing our screens, this time it is that ugly green monster, the Hulk'. I initially had reservations about Hulk', before actually seeing the movie, but to my surprise, I was thoroughly entertained by it and I did like some of the computer generated imagery that dominates it. Then to top it all off, the lead role being done extremely well by an Aussie, meant that the Hulk', is what I expect of a comic book' movie.

Bruce Banner is a Berkeley lab scientist, a young man haunted by his murky past and the parents he never knew. However, when he is exposed to radiation in a lab accident that should have killed him, a ferocious truth about his past begins to emerge. Along with something else, something deep inside his own body that is triggered when he is provoked . . . when he is pushed beyond reason . . . when anger takes over, he transforms into the. . . HULK'!

I really enjoyed the ride that Taiwanese-born director Ang Lee took us on in the Hulk'. I am glad that Lee directed the way he wanted, as I feel it made the movie fresh and original. Another impressive part of the film, were the unique camera shots shown throughout the film by Lee. These shots had up to 3 or 4 different camera angles at any one time, and I really liked that idea. Then the transition back to the original shot was done beautifully. Lee also has to be congratulated for holding true to the Hulk story, as it made the film much more exciting.

The story to this film has certain aspects that need to be highlighted. Its human' element is very memorable, as you feel for the characters of Bruce and Betty, who give the story real emotion. Then their relationship (both professional and social) was handled in such a delicate way, making it a very entertaining side of the story. The Hulk' storyline also had a fine introduction, as it took just the right amount of time at the start, to tie in all the complex elements of the story, including many flashbacks' to the past, which are very important. This allows us as the audience, to learn much more about the man who would become the Hulk'. Hulk's story was well written by James Schamus.

Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a man with a troubled soul, and we learn quite quickly why this is so. I feel Bana was the perfect choice as Bruce Banner, as he gives a great performance throughout the movie. I love the line Bruce says to Betty about being the Hulk', You know what scares me the most? Is when it happens, when it comes over me, and I totally lose control, I like it!' Bruce works with Betty Ross (Jennifer Donnelly), whose emotions and relationships with Bruce/Hulk are of vital importance to the film. Donnelly's character is similar to the one she played in 2002s, A Beautiful Mind'.

Bruce's father, David Banner (Nick Nolte) is a scientist who has disobeyed orders many times and is a complete nutcase. Nolte's performance is wonderful in the film, especially when you learn his reasoning behind making his son the way he is today. The confrontation between father and son at the end of the film was a big highlight for me. You also have Betty's father, General Ross (Sam Elliott), who Betty says she has very little time for, even though he is a high ranking army official. This man has no time for of the Banner family, especially Bruce, who he believes is a danger to society. He says he will kill to be rid of the problem. His daughter explains, that trying to stop him, is only feeding his rage'. There is one real bad guy, a scientist, called Talbot (Sweet Home Alabama's Josh Lucas) whose confrontations with Bruce/Hulk are very memorable. He is not concerned for Bruce's safety as the Hulk, only for the great scientific findings that he will bring.

A lot has been said of the CGI work in the Hulk'. I enjoyed most of the aspects of the CGIs, as they are well done. The night-time CGIs are my favourite, as they make the Hulk look much more real. Also the transformation of Bruce Banner to the Hulk' was well done by the work of the CGIs, as it did seem real' when it actually happened. My favourite Hulk scene', was the confrontation Hulk has with three of his father's dog creations, as this proves that the Hulk is one guy you do not want to upset. However, once the Hulk is shown in the day-time, I feel that the CGIs of the Hulk looked a lot more fake'. This is most evident when the Hulk starts to jump and fly, making him look more and more like a computer driven creature and not the Hulk'. The CGI work on the Hulk' was done pretty well by CGI lead animator, Miguel A. Fuertes.

I believe Hulk' is a good movie because of all the aspects I have mentioned. Its direction, story, characters, actors and computer generated imagery all make this a fine film. I was highly critical of 2002's Spiderman' and this years X-Men 2'. Those comic book adaptations lacked in certain areas, whereas the Hulk' did not. This movie's story shows the Hulk' as creature doing many things not accustom to your normal comic book character, but you must remember, the Hulk is not a superhero', unlike his other counterparts, instead a feared person in the world, who humans believe must be stopped at all cost. In recent times I have had problems with comic book legends' coming to life. But now in 2003, I am contented, thanks mainly to a big ugly green monster, who you would not like when he is angry, known simply as the Hulk'.

Trying too hard...,"Ang Lee falls short on his attempt to bring high art filmmaking to low art comics. In a genre that is full of formula, he tried delivering something different. Too bad he fumbled it.

Don't get me wrong. The movie is good. That is if you resign yourself to the fact that for the first 45 minutes you will be beaten over the head with the same facts about the characters' past again and again till you want to turn green and smash things yourself. You will be slowly fed some mystery about Bruce's past that ends up being unimportant (and easily guessed). You will not see green skin that entire 45 minutes either. Just overblown exposition on a back-story you'll forget (or at least want to).

Once things speed up, you'll see some amazing eye candy of a more subtle nature than most Marvel movies. The desert scenes are incredible and frame the action perfectly. The movement and expressions of the Hulk makes up for his somewhat comical rendering. And the actors themselves do a very good job. My personal favorite was Sam Elliot as General Ross. And Jennifer Connelly was as bewitching as always, and is easily believable in the roll of the beautiful scientist girlfriend.

Ang Lee fails to combine all the ingredients in the end; perhaps because he's better as a different kind of chef. More than likely it's because he was trying to prove that he could bring the Hulk out of the comic book genre and into the world of deep drama. Hey Mr. Lee... it wasn't the mothers and art house film students wearing the t-shirts that said ""HULK"" on them. It was the kids, comic book dorks and the rest of us who grew up on fantastic stories like the Hulk, and just want to be entertained.

What's Big Green and made of Plastic?,"I have to admit I was interested to see what the Hulk would translate to on the big screen. With the success of X-Men and Spiderman from the Marvel stable I thought it would be a safe bet that The Hulk would be up to the same high standard.

I was sadly mistaken......

This is the first film in my living history that I can say was truly awful!

With the marketing frenzy of toys and Hulk gear, you would think that it was suitable for a young audience? No - nowhere near it. Parents be advised *DO NOT* if you value the sanity of your children take them to see this. There are images in there that will give them nightmares for a week.

Great...until the end,"At first I was really enjoying Ang Lee's HULK. The Comic book style & split screens were excellent. The CGI Hulk was incredible. I even cared for Bruce thanks to the excellent build up to when he first gets angry...ROARRRR!

Then Suddenly...POP..The Hulk bubble bursts and there is some weird blob/Energy/Fight/Mind power mess of a final battle which for me ruined everything. On a second viewing where I expected this to happen I wasn't so disappointed so id advise all people to view it a few times just to see the few moments of Ang Lee brilliance that are in this flick.

I'm giving it 7/10 for the fact that up until the final scene I was enthralled by this movie (with a different end it would have got an 8)",7.0,14 May 2004
not a total waste of time,"Looking for a great fun summer block buster? Keep looking. We all saw the previews with the sub-par CGI effects, and to be fair my friends and I agree the effects played better then expected. Eric Bana did a fine job as mild mannered Bruce Banner, and Jennifer Connelly was exceptional as the beauty Betty Ross. That was what was good about the movie. However much of the movie didn't work. At times the CGI effects still looked like a video game (once again I'll say they looked much better then on the trailer). The movie ran way too long. Especially for a movie that has a younger target audience. I enjoyed the story leading up to our first Hulk sighting, but it was too long and dark for younger audiences. Right off the bat during the opening credits there are certain images that could be disturbing for the youngest viewers. Now, even thought it is too long and too slow the worst part was the climactic battle between Bruce and David. I still couldn't follow exactly what happened or how? My friends and I started to try to figure it out and decided we didn't care enough to put the energy into trying. The explanation just didn't make enough sense to satisfy us. Being a comic fan from childhood and a casual fan today I have enjoyed seeing Marvel characters make it to the big screen, but they should make sure the movies being made are good (X-men, Spider man), not mediocre (Daredevil, Hulk), or they will soon see their audience and hype for these movies decline sharply. Bottom line, OK movie but lacking the fun a movie like this should contain.",4.0,21 June 2003
An unusually different summer blockbuster.,"Certain critics have attacked Ang Lee's adaptation of the Incredible Hulk comics and quite rightly so. After all, how dare an action-packed summer blockbuster contain plot and character depth, not to mention profound statements about anger and the relationships between fathers and their children.

Ang Lee has never made a less than very good film and in my view, Hulk is no exception. It is an extremely ambitious picture both visually and in terms of content.

The basic story from the comics concerns scientist Bruce Banner, who is exposed to dangerous gamma radiation causing him to transform into a gigantic Hulk every time he gets angry. The plot of the film however, goes considerably deeper, with Banner's abusive and possibly insane father being responsible for his son's unusual powers. Add to this repressed childhood memories, a complex web of relationships between all the characters, and it makes for quite an intelligent film. Of course it has the requisite action and explosions, but for once they seem to support rather than dominate the story.

Eric Bana plays Bruce Banner and has clearly been cast because he doesn't look like a movie star. This was a brave decision and works reasonably well in the film's favour. Jennifer Connelly is quite good as the love interest. On the other hand, Nick Nolte as Banner's father is outstanding. The direction from Lee is stunning, especially in his use of wipes and split screens, giving the constant impression you are watching a moving comic strip. The special effects are excellent (if a little too bizarre at times) and Danny Elfman contributes his best music score in years.

My main criticism is the film has virtually no humour. If Steven Spielberg could invest a film as serious as Schindler's List with moments of comedy, then surely a few laughs wouldn't go amiss in the Hulk. It takes itself far too seriously and adding comedy would have enabled the audience to suspend disbelief better, as well as enhancing the human drama.

Despite this, I liked the film a great deal. It's an unusually different summer blockbuster and deserves praise for that. It also has an interestingly ambivalent attitude to anger. On the one hand anger is shown as a great emotional release, enabling Banner to confront his repressed memories, and on the other it shows it to be destructive as the Hulk goes on his rampage.

If the film is ultimately judged a failure, then it's one of the most interesting failures of recent years.",7.0,31 July 2003
"This film insults ""The Incredible Hulk"".","Having like so many others enjoyed the TV series ""The Incredible Hulk"" I expected at the very least a decent movie when this picture was recently show on cable. How wrong I was!

This film is all over the place. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, the characters are silly and lack any likability and the direction tries to be clever but is simply ridiculous;the split scenes just add to the confusion and makes the pic more stupid then it already is. Both the script and the direction look like they were done by total amateurs.

The plot and story is hopelessly confused and ludicrously complicated. It is the 1960's and some 'mad scientist' figure experiments on himself to the ultimate detriment of his yet to be born son. Flash forward to the present day.The son, now a scientist,through his own experimentation, becomes the hulk.....blah blah blah.

I turned this movie off before it was over as quite frankly it was giving me a headache and was an insult to the original series.

I give 1 mark for the performing dogs, who were far better in their roles than any of the actors, and another mark for a few of the special effects = total vote 2/10.",2.0,3 February 2005

Not an Action Movie,"This is not an action flick. You'll get about 20 minutes of it in this very long movie, but not much else. Ang Lee, the director of ""Sense and Sensibilities"" is not the right director for this movie. The seemingly endless usage of flashbacks, family mysteries, and misused starpower successfully drags this movie almost to a screeching halt. Lee did a much better job on ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". You're not supposed to look at your watch in an action movie, but I guarantee you'll be wishing it (a) to get to a good part or (b) the end to come. Unfortunately, you may feel like the latter comes before the former.

As for you ""true believers"" out there, you really don't want to know how badly they hacked the origin of The Hulk. Think of the worst ways you could misrepresent the original storyline and you'll still be 3 degrees of separation from how badly they did it in this film.

Not so Incredible Hulk,"...Is a fair comment on Ang Lee's take on 'old Jade Jaws'. However I do think Lee manages to capture a more accurate take on the comic book than the Bixby, Ferringo series did.

Don't get me wrong Bixby was great as Banner, and as a child of 8 I was awe stuck by Ferringo as the Hulk. However taking off the old rose tinted spectacles for a moment. The 70's show is awful to watch 30 years on ! It also bears no relation to Stan Lee's & Jack Kirby's Hulk of the 60's or more importantly the more well realized Peter David, Todd Mcfarlane, Dale Keown, Gary Frank Hulk of the late 80' - 90's.

I enjoyed the comic and still try and read the odd issue now even as I approach 30 years of age, and it's this vision of the Hulk I wanted to see on the big screen.

Lee falls short in lots of areas, the creation of the Hulk differs, this I can live with, no one wants to see the central heroic character (Banner) design a 'Gamma Bomb' for the government after all ! But the addition of Banner's father (Nolte) as a kind of pseudo 'Absorbing Man' just to give the Hulk something to fight doesn't work.

Bringing to light the abuse that Banner suffered at the hands of his father, which caused his personality to facture given rise to the Hulk persona is a nice touch, and draws its inspiration directly from the comic book.

The acting though out is good Eric Bana is perfect as Banner, Jennifer Connelly is fantastic as Betty, and Sam Elliot is superb as General 'Thunderbolt' Ross. I even though Nolte handled his role as David Banner well (a tribute to the t.v. series which renamed Bruce as David, where in fact Banner's father is actually called Brian in the comic).

The other major bug bear viewers have with the film is the eponymous hero of the title the Hulk himself. Lets be honest having a guy painted green in a 170 million dollar blockbuster would have sucked ! The Hulk I personally think is well realized, granted at times he doesn't look real, but people that's cos there ain't not 10 foot tall be people who happen to be green ! He don't look real cos he ain't !

The problem I have with Hulk cgi is Ang Lee, he was motion captured for the role, and quite frankly he doesn't give the Hulk the motion and movement I wanted to see, he doesn't quite look powerful enough at times. It's a minor quibble but it does detract from my enjoyment of seeing the big green guy throwing stuff ! After all he throws a tank, come on people ! A TANK ! and it goes miles ! More of that would have helped !

All in all I think a good take on an iconic character. Not Marvel's best but If your a fan of the comic a must see.",,20 May 2004

A Fantastic Comic-Noire-Indi-Blockbuster,"Months ago i could be heard saying, ""The Hulk, yeah i'll be sure to see that...when im sentenced to an eternity in hell!"" But....I came this past week to think, maybe Ang Lee could make it happen, so i bought my advanced tixs.

The Film, to state it quickly was a little slow at first, allowing u to breath in the characters before all the action, then it kicked up a notch using a pannel multi split screen look to make the Comic in it arise. In all it was a settleing, action packed, but mostly character driven piece. With great acting from all sides of the spectrum, And to top it all off, you got Alan Lee, and the original Hulk as security guards....keep an eye out.

The Unbearable Hulk,"Somewhere, Bill Bixby must be rolling around in his grave. Ang Lee managed to take a fantastic comic book story written by the genius Stan Lee, and twist into this garbled mess of a movie. I'm not a comic book purist, so I'm not going to debate the origin of the Hulk as depicted in this movie vs the comics. However, Ang Lee's adaptation of the Hulk origin is bizarre, and frankly just not that interesting.

The acting is fine, but it's really the directing and editing of the movie that is really sub-par. The scene transitions were just nauseating...I think Ang Lee was trying to keep the movie feeling like a comic book (with the ""panels"" of action going on) but it didn't do it for me.

The special effects when they do show up are pretty good, but if you're looking for any big fights, then you'll be sorely disappointed. There's a scene where the hulk battles 3 dogs (granted, they were mutant dogs, but still...how lame) and another scene at the end that defies explanation, as to how stupid the fight is.

The most underrated Hulk film ever!!,"As the life long fan, overly obsessed with the Incredible Hulk my favorite superhero, thanks to the tv series from the 70s watching reruns with my Dad are some of my best memories, and the reason for my obsession with the Hulk.

I first saw it when it was released in 2003, I was 10 I didn't fully understand it, but regardless I loved it a ton, it was the best version of Hulk made by Hollywood at the time, I didn't know any better. As the years went on the Hulk would return in 2008, with the reboot The Incredible Hulk, which I saw on my 15 birthday and I loved it even more then this one. The point I'm getting at is for many years after both Hulk movies had been out for a long time, I started to hate this one as I felt it was inferior to the 2008 film, after having rewatched it, the love and appreciation I had for it as 10 year old came flooding back into my mind. I won't compare it to the 2008 film, because they're totally different, one is a monster movie/drama and the other is a straight action movie. Both movies are amazing, but at the end of the day this one has far more substance than the 2008 film and more interesting character arch's. Eric Bana is fantastic in the role, I feel the emotional weight from his performance, and Jennifer Connelly is absolutely gorgeous, and perfect bringing a lot of trauma to her role as Betty. I'm just sad that when it was released it didn't have the appeal necessary to bring enough money to warrant a sequel with the same supporting cast. Either way it's an underrated superhero film that deserves much more praise. 10/10 easily.",10.0,6 March 2021

"Pretty good, cartoonish, but I suppose that was intended","It's too bad Ang Lee decided to spend so much time on character development. Normally, that wouldn't be a bad thing in a movie, in fact the opposite is a very common complaint. However, in this case, we are talking about a comic book superhero! No need to waste too much time on how he came to be the Hulk, just get right to the bashing and the smashing.

The CGI effects in this movie are impressive. Unfortunately, in my humble opinion, there are not enough of them. I fully expected that in 2.5 hours, there would be numerous Hulk fight scenes. I can't complain about the scenes they did have, there simply were not enough of them. More than half the movie goes by before the Hulk makes his first appearance, and then most of the rest of it is the Hulk being chased by helicopters. A few battles with dark forces along the way wouldn't have been a bad idea.

Jennifer Connelly is excellent in her role, but who was really watching her ? We were all waiting for the big green man! And did anyone notice that the Hulk was very different in size in some scenes, and smaller in others? I know that he is supposed to get bigger the madder he gets, however in some scenes, like when he trashes the lab, he easily fits in a room. Yet when he is breaking out of the military facility, at one point he comes out of the circular open elevator hatch and can barely fit through the opening. Just moments before we had seen Bruce Banner go down that same elevator inside a hyperbaric chamber accompanied by at least 8 armed guards. Now he is so big his fist is almost as big as the opening. At any rate, it didn't detract from the movie as a whole, it's just an observation.

A good adventure flick, has rewatch value, worth the price of the DVD. I'd give it a 6/10.",6.0,15 October 2003
"The Hulk: Not a bad film, although probably not what most people would be expecting.","This film doesn't resemble most of the OOT CGi fests summer superhero blockbusters that have been coming out over the last few months (possibly a good thing if you have overloaded on them like me). Matrix fanboys might find it rather dull, in fact. The movie it most closely resembles is Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. It has the same sedate pace, some of the beautiful desert scenery shots with accompanying classical music could actually have come straight out of CTHD. (It even has a fight in the tree tops).

Lots of reviews have complained that it takes 45 minutes for the Hulk to appear, but it didn't feel like a long time to me. I actually liked the creation storyline and build up at the start. The other complaint i have seen around is that the Hulk looks fake. I actually thought the graphics looked pretty good (and about as real as a giant green bloke CAN look) and in general better than the scenes in the trailer made them look. My only real problem with them was that they seemed to be trying too hard to make the Hulk a good guy... he never seemed to hurt anyone (almost A-Team style with people always crawling out of crashed vehicles) and in fact came off a little too much like a sulking 2 year old throwing a tantrum and not enough like a menacing hulk.

All the acting was good, especially Jennifer Connelly (grr!) and the old guys (Elliot, Nolte). Eric Bana was ok as Bruce Banner, although since he was playing someone who repressed their feelings he didn't really have a lot to work with.

My favorite bit of the whole film was the cool split screens and clever foreground->background and background->foreground cuts which i thought gave a great comic book look to the whole thing.

So: If you are looking for mindless non-stop action and explosions you probably want to give this a miss... if you liked CTHD or LOTR:FOTR and don't mind slower paced films then you might like it. 7/10

I can't get on-board with the reappraisals,"I think I get what Ang Lee was trying to go for-- a more introspective, tragic superhero story. Instead of drenching the film in grey and black visuals, and going for somber direction, Lee makes the movie more comic-book-y, with split screens evoking comic book panels. However, the whole thing never really comes together. The direction is every bit as obnoxious as Kenneth Branagh's Dutch angle-laden THOR would be years later. The story plods and mopes-- in terms of character development, the more traditional Sam Raimi Spider-Man films or even the Tim Burton Batman movies do a better job at making us feel for their heroes and villains.

What kills the movie dead is the lead performance. Eric Bana's Bruce is a sadsack nonentity. He's not soulful or charismatic or ANYTHING really. I can't tell if it's the acting or the writing though-- none of the actors really shine, though Sam Elliott is the only one who feels like he's actually trying.

Overall, I was very bored and disappointed.",3.0,9 September 2022
Interesting but where is the fun,"I went to see the Hulk being a fan of Stan Lee and all the marvel movies so far, and I have to say I was let down. First, the film takes too long to develop and then once it does, it plays more like a ""B"" monster movie then a comic book. I think with this film they missed the whole point of comic books, they are for fun. The computer generated Hulk is OK and the action, when there is action, seems to work. But the rest of the film is just boring. Even the actors seem to be hardly breathing. When Jennifer Connelly is attacked by monster dogs, she sits in her car like she is waiting for a bus, no fear, no anger, she looks like she is practicing Zen. This film made Dare Devil look like a barrel of fun. The plot is interesting, but we all know it is too far fetched to be taken that serious. The best think I can say about the film is Nick Nolte does a good job. I don't know maybe I am missing the point, but I don't think so, I think this film is just not that good.",6.0,21 June 2003

But THIS. This is not in anyway remotely interesting to anyone except those who think that terrible acting and clunky dialogue is enthralling. All the actors are either over-acting egomaniacs or dull morons with no acting talent at all.

But that's just half the film. The rest of it concerns the HULK RAMPAGE and holy ****, I couldn't believe it. I have nothing against CGI except when there is no alternative. Obviously that means a lot of comic adaptions need it. It's the quality of it that really gets me. Remember the Hulk Cartoon For Kids?

Also in the excellent cast are Betty Ross(beautiful Jennifer Connelly) and her father General Ross(Sam Elliot, grizzled and effective as always).

He also fell from the top of the earth's atmosphere into the Ocean and was fine.

This didn't have anything in common with Ang Lee's other films. There was some great scenary in almost every location where the film was shot. The decision to cast Eric Bana as HULK was perfect. Apparently Billy Kudrup of ALMOST FAMOUS was Ang's fist choice but the actor turned the role down. Ang even turned down the change to direct T3 to direct this movie.

A Deep and Engrossing Comic Book Epic!,"Sure many folks have problems with the cgi Hulk, but get over it. Even if the Hulk looked 99% real, he still would have not seemed real - because you know he's not real. Get my drift?

Hulk is one of more realistic comic book adaptations because of its emotion and taking time to develop the character(s). Ang Lee does a masterful job of executing a flawed and limited script with excellent direction of the two young stars. Bana and Connely give real depth to Banner and Betty - you really care what is going to happen to them, their relationship. But overall, this movie is about the relationship between parent and child. It delves deep into the interworkings of very complicated child/parent relationship. Even the Hulk touches his inner human (if you will) in a flashback of a repressed childhood memory. The movie has depth and heart. Ang Lee should be commended for not directing the typical comic book movie. Even if you don't want the emotional side, Hulk delivers in its final hour with a slam bang wrap up. My score: 8/10!",6.0,28 October 2003
Hulk smash bad movie!,"I walked into Hulk excited. I was hoping for a joyous smash-fest movie about the Hulk and his destructive powers. However, I got majorly disappointed. The movie started out with some promise, with an acceptable origin, and a decent Bruce Banner. However, everybody else is so ridiculously different than in the comics that if you changed the Hulk and the names, you could fool somebody into thinking this wasn't even a comic movie.

Now, the first thing you notice is that major characters have been removed or revamped. I never knew Betty Ross was a scientist. I didn't know Rick Jones was apparently never born. It seems so, since he is completely removed from this movie. This might be a decent movie underneath everything they made so different, but as an adaptation, it's awful.

The best thing about this movie is when the Hulk is set loose. The CGI they used to make him is extremely well-done, and makes for a very believable not-so-jolly green giant. However, he also has a total of two lines, one of which is in a dream sequence. You don't hear a single ""Hulk Smash!"" throughout the entire film. Still, he's strong, and does pull a couple multiple-mile leaps. So really, the Hulk is the best thing about it.

Now, the humans aren't all that great. They came up with a decent way of modernizing how Bruce Banner got the monster in him, but it is way too hammed up, just as all the other characters are. It might seem they're deliberately trying to be campy, and they are, but not in a good way.

The villain is completely implausible. I won't identify him for sake of spoilers, but he makes no sense and is completely new and has nothing to do with the comics. Bad. And the fight scenes, while they show Hulk's strength, can be ridiculous. Hulk-dogs? Just seeing a green, mutant poodle made me want to vomit in my seat.

However, there is a very nifty comic-book touch in how the movie's shot. Occasionally, multiple camera angles will be shown on screen at once, which gives a feel very like comic book panels. It's a really nice touch, and a very memorable thing that I hope more comic-book movies do, at least the campy ones.

However, there's just not enough I can say to compliment this movie. There are nearly no Godzilla-esquire destruction scenes, which would make the movie well worth watching. The characters talk too much. It tries too hard to pull a Spider-Man by focusing more on Bruce Banner than the Hulk, but they failed to notice that the Hulk is interesting and Bruce Banner isn't. All in all, this movie is simply impossible to recommend to anybody who's ever read the comic. However, if you've never read a Hulk comic book before, you may be able to enjoy this. It's just sad this appeals to the opposite of its intended audience. 4/10",4.0,16 April 2005
Problematic comic book film,"This film, featuring the rampaging Marvel Comics character, played by a CGI creature, is an interesting film... The filmmakers decided to expand on the comics storyline with a backstory of Nick Nolte as David Banner's father, and claiming that he was responsible for what becomes of his son. Plenty of scenes with Nolte and Eric Bana as David Banner that play off the father-son conflict and consume much of the first half of this overly long film.. However, the filmmakers seem to have misjudged their audience, thinking that people who go to see a film called ""The Hulk"" want to sit thru an hour and a half of psychobabble before getting to the action. Once the creature finaly appears, we get some entertaining action sequences where he smashes things and battles helicopters and tanks and some fun setpieces. The CGI work is better than expected from the trailers and kinda works in context though it's certainly not realistic by any stretch. Some of Ang Lee's stylistic touches, such as his inventive use of wipes and split screens to aproximate the comic book feel are kinda neat, but don't really advance the storyline. The film has a couple of problems.. the biggest one is that Eric Bana as Banner is so bland and uninteresting that we can't wait for him to get off screen and be replaced by the Hulk, who even as a CGI creation has more personality than Bana does. Jennifer Connelly as the love interest is ok, but the thankless part doesn't let her do much more than look mopey most of the film. Another flaw is the over reliance on a contrived backstory and flashbacks, some of which don't get explained. A definite hit and mess affair, that is still worth seeing for those end fight sequences, though having one key character become a weird water creature at the end didn't make much sense.

Pure Junk - A Disgrace to the original hulk,"The director should be banned from hollywood. I would never see any of his future flicks. This movie put me to sleep. It hurt to watch it. So boring. Horrible acting, horrible script, need I say more? Got to be one of the worst movies of all time. How this junk can be approved by anyone is beyond me. And how people actually can pay to see this junk is also beyond me. Garbage all the way around. Did this waste of a director even watch the original tv series? Most definately not! STAY FAR AWAY!!",1.0,28 June 2003
"Best, and least understood, comic book movie",,10.0,3 June 2018
Bad choice for director.,"I remember back when I first heard that Hulk was being made into a motion picture. At the time I was rather excited, as I grew up watching the Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno TV Show and really loved it. But then a bit later a director by the name of Ang Lee was hired on to helm the film. I vividly remember my first thoughts: ""He is going to ruin it!"" At the time I'd only seen two other Ang Lee films, ""The Ice Storm"", which was a fine film, but nothing spectacular and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (Which personally I thought was a complete waste of time). So, yeah, I'll be the first to admit that I judged the film before I'd even seen it, but I knew his directing style and it just wasn't going to fly with ""Hulk"". After seeing the preview I was less than thrilled with the special effects, but even still, it looked like it might be fun and just maybe he'd prove me wrong. Sadly, he did not.

In some respects, the film was better than expected, but not many. For instance, I thought the special effects were much better than they originally looked in the trailers...it may have been that they were in context within the film, maybe they had more time to work on them, or maybe I'd just come to terms with them, I don't know. But in any case I thought they looked pretty damn good at certain points and rarely looked terrible.

It is my personal opinion that in order to make a really good comic-to-film adaptation you need to base the film in reality and then throw in some border-line far-fetched sci-fi and finally some fantastic characters, all without going too far. In my opinion Ang Lee went too far with the fantastic-ness of Hulk. Bullet-proof...OK, maybe. Being able to hurl himself miles in a single bound...I don't think so. It's not a major plot point in the film by any means, so I could get passed it, but it was just a little too much for me...it made him look a little too cartoonish.

The fact that you have to watch quite a bit of character development before you get to see the green beast didn't bother me too terribly much, but the editing, the acting and the way the story was told did bother me. I really didn't like the whole comic-book-editing that he tried in the film. Sometimes it worked, but other times it was too distracting and made it painfully hard to ""get into"" the film. Personally, I dislike any editing that reminds me that I'm watching a film and that this is not reality.

As far as the acting talent goes, I thought it was less than impressive. Sam Elliott is usually a great actor, but I found him incredibly annoying in this film, like he was acting overly angry throughout the entire film. Eric Bana was OK, but I didn't buy his angry moments, he just didn't pull it off. Jennifer Connolly did a fine job however, I can't say anything bad about her. Josh Lucas was decent, but nothing spectacular. Nick Nolte was also decent, but very annoying at times, more due to the dialog than his acting abilities.

And the last order of business is the actual story used to bring ""Hulk"" to life. For the most part, I thought the story was actually pretty good with some really good ideas...but then again, there were some god-awful ideas too. The entire last 20 minutes of the film was HORRIBLE, just plain RIDICULOUS (special effects were pretty good though). As one other reviewer on this site said, it seemed like they ran out of ideas so they slapped together something to get the film released, while not bothering to think that perhaps this just doesn't make any sense. There were also other minor story points throughout the film that either didn't make sense, seemed silly, or just plain didn't work.

I'd also like to say a little something about the soundtrack. The soundtrack was really good, but way too repetitive, I was in shock how many times the main theme was used. It sounded good, but too much of a good thing makes it not a good thing anymore.

All in all this could have been a really good film with a different director. Ang Lee may be a good director within certain genres, but comic-based films is not one of them. I'd place this film somewhere between Daredevil, Punisher and Elektra as far as quality goes. Far below Spider-man (1&2), X-Men (1&2...and probably 3), Fantastic Four, and Batman Begins. Although, it was far better than Catwoman. I guess I can say this, if you are a die-hard fan of Ang Lee and like experimental films, then you might like this film. If you want a fast-paced, fun comic-book film, this is probably not the film for you.",7.0,21 December 2005
Very poor put together film,"I was so sad when I went to this. This CGI looked like a play station game. I would love to know how fabric purple shorts fit after growing a number of feet. I thought clothing stops fitting after a Thanksgiving dinner. I think the t.v. show was so much better. I hated that he grew tall it just really dumbed down the film. The film was to long and slow. Boring for kids. The lady lead actress is dull and the only thing it had good going for it was Josh Lucas. Don't make these same mistakes again if the film's producer's are reading this.

HULK want sequel NOW!,"While other people might have most enjoyed seeing the HULK leaping about, I really liked the first part of the movie - the part that sets up the story and contains no HULK scenes at all. It's quite a drama, not a kids' movie or a cartoon. Don't take your toddlers; it's rated PG-13 (in the USA) for a reason! It rewards those who pay careful attention, so I wouldn't recommend it for those who prefer the typical twenty-two minute TV episode, either. The soundtrack is crafty. This movie never creeps into MTV territory like some movies I've seen, but the music relatively unobtrusively adds to the mood.

Eric Bana's acting is very different to his characterizations in ""Chopper"" and his other earlier work, which impressed me. He showed another side to his acting ability, something that people who have seen him only in this movie might not appreciate. Nick Nolte's and Sam Elliott's characters were a bit overblown - or maybe it's set in a world where men become increasingly unstable as they age! To me, Jennifer Connelly's character is more of the cookie-cutter Hollywood romantic interest. Overall, I guess to some people that makes it a ""guy flick""... oh, yeah, and there's that giant green monster, too.

I also appreciated the ending. It's not the typical Hollywood ending, all sweetly tied up with a pink bow or a wedding or whatever. Instead, it provides an interesting point for launching into a sequel....",,21 June 2003
Even I doubted this movie but was very impressed,"After the hype and previews got me turned off to this movie, I decided to go see it anyways opening day and much to my surprise ended up really enjoying it. The CGI turned out to be very impressive and the story line and acting made it a very credible movie. I actually would catagorize it as a Matrix 1 quality movie. Everything was done right but the only one problem was my butt started to hurt because it was such a long movie. It worth it to see it once in the theatre and then own it on DVD so you can watch the whole thing with the comfort of a REAL chair. I'm picky about my movies so take my point of view as a person who is pessimistic about this style of a movie and even I turned out to like it.",7.0,22 June 2003

Basicly the story tries for big time epic drama but stumples and falls almost immediatly.

"The Hulk Hysteric, Nolte goes Nietzsche and Connelly Calms","The Hulk is angry again and this time hes not Lou Ferringo but a CGI monster, as strong as he was in the Marvel comic and greener than ever. But why is Nick Nolte, with his now trademark vagabond look, lurking in the background?

The Hulk here becomes a symbol of male aggressiveness in general, or an over-aggressive person in particular. Its about power, and Nietzsche is paraphrased by Nolte on more than one occasion. The military is of no use here, they are just another type of aggressive power, and no power is as great as Hulk power! The Hulk can only really be stopped by a female, a Jennifer Connelly is needed to calm his green ass down.

Ang Lee is no fool - the film makes a quite conscious attempt at creating a more systemic mythology, which gives it a substance that makes it rewarding to watch, in a way that it otherwise would not have been. Much like 'Batman Begins', and the Spiderman films, there is enough humanity within the frames of this picture to make it more than a CGI extravaganza.

An FX feast it is though, but also cinematically beautiful. Photography, scenery and overall aesthetic is quite perfectly executed. Eric Bana as Banner works just fine (though he is no Bill Bixby!) and Jennifer Connelly is always very nice to watch on screen. Nolte plays his slime-ball card well.

All in all 'Hulk' is more than meets the eye, and what does, is quite appealing as well.",7.0,11 May 2006

Slow and mediocre.,"This film was slow, and Ang Lee's attempts at comic-book feel (through the use of split-screens and multiple angles) degraded the quality of the otherwise decent cinematography.

Eric Bana was fortunately a good fit for the role of The Hulk. The film's problems were primarily the pacing of the story.

One Comic Book Movie,,,19 October 2003
(extremely good 3D + action + mostly cool editing) - (lengthy uncool bits) = worth seeing,"Amazing cgi fuels great action sequences. The HULK character is a thrill to watch. I was mezmerised by scenes starring the HULK, and wasn't distracted from the fact I was watching a big 3D render. Sure I marvelled in the known truth that this was all built by artists on computers, but I'd quickly get lifted out of that perception the next time a big close-up of HULK filled the screen.

The details in the skin, movement, and expressions effectively prevent your mind from ""summing up"" what you see before you. There just isn't time to scan the image and build enough evidence against the illusion that HULK is in there with the actors.

Not all HULK scenes are equal though! There is particularly a handful of scenes and moments where he looks spot on real, no question. Other times you might pick up on obvious 3D side effects, such as very slightly over-enhanced colour or lighting on HULK, or slightly exaggerated movement or odd momentum. 3D characters in other movies suffer from a definite animated-look. Luckily for the HULK, he mostly pulls off the illusion of really being in there on the set.

Eric Bana plays a good Bruce. Some of the talking scenes are long, and you start wanting the HULK back! A lot of orchestral music - too much in movies today I think, and it puts me to sleep! It seems everything else in movies has evolved except sleepy orchestral soundtracks.

Comic box editing effect a bit over-done, or not used very well, but it's cool. General editing and camera is still excellent.

In the end you get the best 3D ever and one menacing green mofo!

A flawful movie,"The movie is called ""The Hulk"". But our superhero gets cheated as Bruce and Betty takes up most of the time in the movie. The movie tries to be really serious, but how can it? It is about the Hulk! And to add more insult to its seriousness, the Hulk computer-generated character is unconvincing. Which leads us to the biggest flaw of all, bad CGI. Although it made a valiant effort in new territory, making computer-generated humans look real is still a long road ahead. The Hulk does not look real. He is very silly when he is with real humans since he stands out like Roger Rabbit. During scenes when he fight with other CGI creatures, it looked like a video game. Because he looks so fake and stands out from everyone else, you don't really feel for him since he is not perceived to be real. Perhaps they should use a wax Hulk next time.

Packs too much of a wallop to hold to one movie.,"It's a fine film of its nature but I think the main problem that it has is the fact that it put too much in the film's story to make every thing seems implausible. If they just stick to the simple origin of the Hulk instead of trying to put too much too soon, it would have been a better story. If they wanted to tell more of the Hulks origin, they should have waited for the sequel instead of packing this film with too much detail. The special effect does not do the character justice, and we really don't see the big guy intill 45 minutes into the picture. The acting is top notch, and the direction is fine but with out a script with some coherency (Hollywood's biggest sin) you don't have much of a film at all.

A Hulking Underrated Film.,,10.0,9 July 2015
"I was very excited when I went in, but very disappointed when I left","I was really looking forward to the release of this film. I always loved the comic books, and with the visual effects capabilities now, I thought this movie could be really good. That being said, I want to point out that the reason I even gave the movie a 6 rating was because there are a couple really cool scenes. If not for those two or three scenes I would have really felt ripped off.

Visually it was absolutely stunning. I couldn't have asked for more. I also thought the acting was just fine. Unfortunately though, the problem was that Ang Lee tried to hard to make too much out of the film. It seems like an eternity before anything even remotely exciting happens. I found myself very bored all the way through and just waiting for the Hulk to re-enter and create some havic. Not to mention the movie felt really long, and the end climactic Hulk versus bad guy scene is a big let down. With the exception of the few cool scenes, the other audience members started to leave, and yell things. So obviously I was not alone in my feeling. I think this movie will start off well at the box office, because of all the advertising, and then come crashing down. If you need to see this movie, it is a movie that is good to see on the big screen. I just hope that someday someone can really do this film justice, because this wasn't it.",6.0,20 June 2003
Complete and utter travesty,"This 2003 modernization of the Hulk by Ang Lee is total and utter garbage. Nothing works in the film's favor, NOTHING.

Many have praised the film for it's comic book style look, and it looks good enough; too bad the film is such a disappointment that it doesn't count for much. Director Ang Lee wanted to flesh out Banner's psychological state, and while it may have been fascinating for him to deal with, it's unbearable for the audience. The film drags incredibly and the father vs. son story which takes center stage midway through the film is bad beyond words (climaxing with the father turning into some sort of electric entity???).

All the actors are good but here they look bored and uninterested. Who could blame them? Bana, who's proving to be quite the player in Hollywood, completely sleepwalks through the entire proceedings and Connelly doesn't look like she just picked up the Oscar. It's not surprising that Bana, who said earlier that he might want to reprise the role, has suddenly found that he can't find the time to do a sequel (maybe if Ang Lee is MIA he might reconsider his time schedule).

Special effects, well, they're good but totally overblown. The look of the Hulk is bad, Lou Ferrigno looks way better as the green giant. Those PJ's he's wearing here are just plain tacky. I for one didn't like those airplane jumps he continually makes and that scene where he grabs hold of a fighter jet and makes the journey to outer space is completely ridiculous. Ahhh, I hate Ang Lee, he's better off directing costume dramas concerning gay cowboys. Is he secretly trying to destroy every tough guy image, whether it be tough horse riders or monster green giants?

I'd go as far as to say that a lame episode in the Hulk television series starring Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno is far superior to this piece of junk. If there's a Hulk 2, I pray Ang Lee will stay far away.",1.0,6 July 2006
It's Not Easy Being Green,"`You're making me angry,' says Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) before transforming into the muscle bound Hulk. `You won't like me when I'm angry.' Oh yes we will Bruce. In fact, we like you lot more when you're angry. Director Ang Lee has taken the comic book bully's story and added touches of intelligence, style and grace, everything in fact, except personality. Bana (whose Ken doll hair I found very distracting) plays Banner as an emotionally detached zombie, draining him of any spark.

Recent Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly doesn't fare much better. Her Betty Ross is a pretty picture - beautiful to look at, but lacking in any dimension. It is amazing that a movie which expects the audience to buy a wild chemical explanation as to why Banner blows up into his hulking alter ego can have so little chemistry between its two lead actors. There is barely a glimmer when they are on-screen together.

Not so when the big guy enters the picture. The CGI creation is part King Kong, part Frankenstein and all Harryhausen, but yet seems like nothing we've ever seen before. Like Frankie and Kong before him, he capable of mindless violence and mass destruction, also has a gentle, compassionate side. In one scene that seems to echo King Kong, Hulk picks up Betty in his massive fist before gently placing her on the roof of a car so he car get a better look at her. Here we see the marvels of the CGI and the Hulk's wonderfully expressive face. This collection of pixels and binary code ironically brings the movie to life. Of course the Hulk on a rampage is more fun, but Lee paces the action carefully, barely giving us a glimpse of the main attraction until almost an hour into the film, and then uses him sparingly.

People expecting to see an action movie will be sorely disappointed. Hulk (the movies drops `the') has its moments - the battle with the killer mutant dogs is exciting and violent while Hulk's desert show-down with the army has the makings of a classic in the superhero oeuvre - but favours the cerebral over the physical. Most of the action here takes place inside Bruce Banner's mind as he battles with his fate. Hulk historians will note that stylistically Lee has crafted a film using crazy jump-cuts, dissolves and split screens that emulates the wild design of the original comic books.

The supporting cast fares much better than the above the title actors. Josh Lucas hands in a one-note performance as the fleabag military weapons contractor turned Hulk's punching bag, but seems to be having a good time while doing it. Sam Elliott plays Ross, an army muckety-muck who is bent on destroying the green blowtop. In the hands of a lesser actor this would have been a stereotypical turn as the paranoid, untrusting military man. Instead Elliot gives us the stiff façade of a career warrior, but reveals a softer core - someone who is tormented by the unpleasant choices he has to make.

But it is Nick Nolte's scene chewing that steals the movie. With his hair standing on end (think of the famous mug shot from last September) and wild eyes blazing Nolte is an organic visual effect that rivals his CGI co-star. As David Banner, the scientist father of the Hulk, he experimented with his own DNA and passed the genetic flaw on to his son. The elder Banner is only playing with only 44 cards in the deck, and Nolte's over-the-top performance makes his a riveting character.

Hulk may have its flaws, but Ang Lee has done something really interesting here. He's taken the hoary old superhero genre and freshened it up visually while adding a level of thoughtfulness and context that is missing from other movies of its kind.",,22 June 2003

This is a great Hulk feature (although not as good as The Incredible Hulk).

Falls a little short,"From a cursory evaluation of the talent involved, Hulk appears to be the most interesting and unique comic book adaption yet to be brought to the silver screen. Director Ang Lee has just come off a career high with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Jennifer Connelly is also flying high from an Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress for A Beautiful Mind. Add in Nick Nolte and the red hot Marvel comics franchise, Hulk would appear to be a winner from all avenues. What emerges, though hardly poor, is somewhat underwhelming, and lacking in the very thing some critics have praised the film for, emotional depth.

Most people are familiar with the outlines of this story, in many cases simply because of the late 1970's television series starring Lou Ferrigno (who makes a cameo here, along with famous Marvel editor-in-chief Stan Lee) as the green goliath. Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a man who has some trouble with rage, and after an accident in his laboratory involving nanobots and gamma radiation, his rage is now manifested in a transformation into a walking giant, green skinned and ranging between nine and fourteen feet tall. The creature is all rage, and can only be tempered by Bruce's feelings for his former girlfriend and fellow scientist, Betty Ross (Connelly). The situation is made complicated by a number of factors: Betty's friend Glenn Talbot(Josh Lucas) who is interested in Bruce and her research for military purposes, her father General Ross (Sam Elliot), Talbot's superior, who is suspicious of Bruce because of his past dealings with Bruce's father, David Banner (Nick Nolte). But Bruce's father proves the be the greatest complication of all, wondering back into his life from nowhere, and with motives that seem less than pure.

Hulk is definitely the most different of the modern comic adaptations. It is not just a popcorn flick, although it has many of the attributes of one. It contains the requisite action scenes and elaborate special effects, but the film has an art house soul. It seems to be interested mostly in the characters and the effects of the story on them. But yet, at the same time, it can't seem to quite accomplish this to a satisfactory end. Perhaps it is because the film is about emotionally stunted characters (both Bruce and Betty are victims of a form of mental and emotional child abuse, if not physical) that the narrative fails to grab your emotions and get you involved in the character's plight. The scenes between the leads feel somewhat cold, leaving you without a center to grasp hold of in the picture.

It doesn't help that the plot isn't exactly a tightly wound, carefully constructed piece either. The main story, concerning experiments that David Banner performed on himself and passed on to his son, is inadequately explained. More than once during the film, I found myself unsure of the details, leaving me scratching my head as to what was trying to be resolved. Also, the dialogue at times seems to resemble stilted 1960's comic writing more than any other recent adaptation, with melodramatic lines that are overplayed by the actors, such as a scene where General Ross confronts David Banner with such lines as ""Human experimentation is just to dangerous! You are playing with nature!"" Scenes such as this pull you out of the film and make it seem more like a comic book adaptation and less like a story about real characters.

Ang Lee and editor Tim Squyres have added one interesting visual trick to the film, assembling scenes with split-screen techniques and comic book style panels which make the film seem as if it is a filmed, moving comic book. This works at times, such as when the technique is employed to show two different characters reactions to developments when in a normal camera set-up only one could be displayed, but it also proves distracting at times when the individual pieces seem to be even in their importance and we are left unsure which to focus on.

No element garnered more criticism than the use of computer generated imagery to realize the Hulk. I, for one, think that the work is exceptional, although not without flaws, and find myself wondering what people really are looking for when complaining about the Hulk. Would a six-foot-five man, or even a seven-foot man, have served the story as well as a nine-foot to fourteen-foot behemoth, especially in scenes where visual effects would have been required no matter what? The work is not perfect, but it does push the envelope, and what would have happened had Steven Spielberg and James Cameron not pushed the envelope a decade ago (although some would question that they should have, but that is for another discussion).

In the end, Hulk proves to be a film with great promise that falls short of fulfilling it's mission. There is a lot to like here, and credit must be given to the filmmakers for being willing to push the comic book adaptation in new directions, but it doesn't quite add up to a success.",7.0,12 October 2003
This movie sucks!,"I went to see the sneak preview of this movie in the hopes that it could follow in the footsteps of some of the other comicbook adaptations that have ended up becoming good movies, i.e., X-Men, Spiderman. Instead I got what I consider a joke of a movie, the plot was weak, the Hulk looked like a cartoon, and there was very little action. The movie spent entirely too much time on character development, and not nearly enough energy went into plot development or action sequences. The two and three way split screen shots make the movie look like a cheap TV show, and the acting and dialogue follow suit. In my opinion, this movie completely relies on it's CGI ""Hulk"" to put people in the seats. I wouldn't even say there was a conscious effort to make this an entertaining movie, but more to show off what the film industry can do with computers & CGI.

Grrr,"there are comics and there are movies. i love comics and i love movies. but i have yet to find a comic made into a movie that i love.

they messed with the origin yet again. why? because ang lee wanted to. i have finally given up on comics becoming movies. the hulk looked great, acting was fine, story line was good. but what sets the whole tone of the movie (any comic movie for that matter) is how they handle the origin. is it really that hard to take the origin from the comic... heck why not use the comic as a storyboard for the origin and just do it frame by frame, line by line. they wouldnt even have to waste any time and effort in writing anything its all there. but no... we have ang lee's hulk, sam rami's spiderman... etc. i honestly cant go see any of these movies again. while the movie itself might be great, change the origin even a little and you change the character.

i hope others enjoyed the movie more than myself. i did enjoy it at first but the more i thought about it... i give the movie a 1.",1.0,23 June 2003
Rigid and Sincere,"An honourable and serious attempt at rather bland source material, director 'Ang Lee' makes the green monster more human in his well versed and visually stunning action drama. Eric Bana is perfect in the role, and is the master of serious conveyance of feelings and emotions. The film oozes brilliance around him with gorgeous and memorable sets and outstanding CGI battle action. It's a heavy film that echoes the weight of its protagonist.

What drags the film down somewhat is the overburden on the hero which feels unrealistic in parts, and the villain appears delusion and is badly explained to the point of being confusing, leading to a drab final act.",7.0,31 May 2024
What a Shame,"It just didn't have to be that bad of a movie. But, it was. This movie fails on so many categories I am not sure where to begin. Everything annoyed me. The long (60-minute) introduction into how Bruce becomes the Hulk. The fact that we get no real action until half way into the movie. The fact that the acting was horrible, the directing was equally as horrible, the script was putrid and the actors were miscast.

About the only thing of any worth in this movie was the SFX. Besides that I hated this film. What a shame. They had a great story in the Hulk. Where X-Men and Spiderman thrive this movie flounders. I could not wait for it to end and thought to myself that you would have to be a complete idiot to make Hulk - The Sequel. Unless you totally get new actors, new directors and new script writers. 4/10 stars.

First I want to say months ago I didn't give much thought to the Hulk.Well I sure did when I saw the film!The music by Danny Elfman is great!I was really surprised this time!I didn't think he could tie his score of Batman and the Planet of the Apes!The cast was really perfect!Eric Bana played the part very good!Jennifer Connelly was really good and she was so much different than she was in the Roceteer.Sam Elliott was great!Josh Lucas play his villain part well and I hope to see him in more bad guy parts and as for Nick Nolte give him the academy award now!Lou Ferrigno looked awesome in his cameo!Ang Lee's direction was very good and his comic split screens really worked well.As for the action it was incredible!It is hard to say what I like most of the action scenes but I loved it when the Hulk was just destroying those tanks!This is a very,very,very,serious movie and there is very little humor if any and I really don't know if kids will like it because of the serious attitude and dark story it has.This isn't just another movie based on a comic book,it is very unique and all together different.The special effects were great and I loved the way the Hulk looked and he looked very real!The end of the movie was good.I am satisfied with film.I think this is what all Hulk fans have waited for!Go see it!",10.0,5 July 2003
Not as bad as people say.,"I went and saw this film on opening night, and although there wasn't as much action as I would have liked, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I think the main reason people are giving this film negative reviews is because they expected ""HULK SMASH PUNY CAR/HUMAN/TRAIN/TANK!!"" right from the beginning of the film and were upset that they had to wait forty minutes to see Banner transform. I did not mind so much, because I believe an excellent job was done giving background information and depth to the characters before we see the monstrosity at work. Final thoughts: If you want to see a feature length smash fest with no depth then skip out. If you want to see a good, but not great film and are a fan of the comics, then definitely see The Hulk.

It takes a grindingly slow hour before we ever get to see the titled star of the film in all his green glory. In his second scene we get to watch the brute pummel a trio of mutant dogs to death while Jennifer Connelly sits by watching without much emotion -- a lack of feeling shared by the audience.

Not as bad as the people would suggest.,"I will not write a lengthy, highly detailed recap of the plot for this movie. Instead I will say that the Hulk was decent. Since the success of the first X-Men movie, Marvel and Hollywood have been churning out comic to movie adaptations like no tomorrow. That might be why this movie wasn't as well recieved as say Spider-Man or X2. As a long time fan of comics, I enjoy it when any of my favorite heroes make it to the big screen,I watch and critique these movies as just that, movies. Sure, the basis for these movies are small colored books dating back to the early 60's so I'm willing to let certain character and plotline inequities go. What people don't realize is that when a comic or cartoon or videogame for that matter gets picked up for a theatrical release, the writers must try to make it universally acceptable or understandable to all who see it. Sometimes this ruins the movie, making it either too complex or too shallow. I believe the Hulk was a success in terms of capturing the comic book feel. The acting isn't as bad as everybody says. The CGI of the Hulk is realistic looking enough. There were times in the movie he looked fake, others, like he was really standing next to Jennifer Connelly. I do feel it lacks in action, the biggest fight is Hulk vs. the dogs and there's no real showdown at the end between Hulk and an all powerful villian. There was a showdown, but it wasn't really interesting. My final grade on this movie: For general audiences:C For comic fans: B",,30 October 2003

let down,"When I was a kid I use to watch the hulk the tv show that is and watch Lou Ferrigno (David Banner) dominate all that was in front of him. The movie by Ang Lee is another story, it was a major let down. The beginning to the middle was entertaining at most and then the end was just like what happened. Then ending was ambiguous especially when Bruce and his father talk for the last time in that hanger and the fight scene occurs between the both of them. Well maybe the Punisher will be a little more interesting.",6.0,23 June 2003
A bad example of CGI,"The movie could've been okay if the Hulk looked realistic, but he didn't. Give me Lou Ferrigno (or anybody else as I would've rather watched Gary Coleman as the Hulk than the crappy rendition they gave us). It was like watching a cartoon character mixed with real settings and real people (think ""Mary Poppins""). CGI can be done much better and we've seen it - just look at the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park"" or at ""Spider Man."" Even Jar Jar Binks looked more realistic than this garbage! I can't believe they were able to pass this off as a movie. The story is intelligent and the actors do a good job but the Hulk is the centerpiece and he is horrible. Come on Hollywood, take the time to at least make the CGI halfway believable if you are going to use it!

The film itself takes forever to get started; comes to life for about forty minutes when the pretty funny looking--but still fun--Hulk begins to smash things, although the ""Hulk dogs"" are the worst idea imaginable; and then totally spirals out of control with the most ludicrous and non-sensical ending of any film this summer.

Gut-wrenching masterpiece. Too bad most people misunderstood it,"2003 Hulk is exceptionally underrated in my opinion. Perhaps because people didn't get what they were expecting? The older one is more cerebral and insightful with lots of flashbacks to the past and more back story, whereas the 2008 version was more about let's get to it, smash up action and special effects... although I don't think the special effects were so bad in this one for 2003. The characters and acting are what make this movie great. Eric Bana, Nick Nolte, Jennifer Connelly, and Sam Elliott are all the best at the characters they play. I find myself now disappointed with the later incarnations. The 2003 version had deep, thoughtful characters, with appropriately developed motivations. The scenes particularly between Nolte and Bana near the end are gut wrenching and disturbing. With a current rating of only 5.6, I guess most people don't appreciate that. To a certain degree and especially now with superior CGI, I can understand somewhat why this movie hasn't held up. Parts of it come across as cartoonish and the split screen method showing multiple angles and viewpoints at once was unconventional... but hey, isn't this based off of comic books? In that regard, this movie holds up the most consistently with the Hulk's comic book roots. I'm willing to forgive some weaker special effects, especially since they were so unique... however the dog fight scene where Hulk protects Betty Ross and then the tussle near the end with Hulk smashing apart military tanks, tossing them miles away like rubbish, are still impressive to this day.",8.0,4 June 2019

movie of the year,"first up, i am not a comic book fan and so far (before the hulk) i don't think much of all the movies made from comic books ie spiderman, daredevil and even x-men. they're all average and sometimes even dumb (see spiderman). but i guess since their target audience are kids n ppl who just like action n nothing else so i guess they're made that way. anyway, back to the hulk, i must say this is the best movie of the year. i am surprised myself. after watching the not so inviting trailer and just the fact that its a story bout someone turning into a mindless green monster and trashing stuff, i am very surprised that i LOVED it. i liked the fact that it has MORE DRAMA than action and i liked the fact that it uses TALENTED ACTORS. anyway, this makes u think and even feel sorry for the hulk. ang lee did a great job. nick nolte and eric bana was superb. the trailer didnt do justice to it. i remember watching the trailer and going 'thats so cgi' but when i watch the movie, its more realistic. some ppl might complain that it doesnt look real, but to me that is as real as a 15-ft green man can get. the only comic feeling to it is the multiple frames that was used in th film. overall, great plot, great storyline, great actors and a great movie altogether .. all 140 minutes of it. and id definitely watch it again!",,19 June 2003
Ang Lee made me Angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.,"I don't remember Bruce Banner being the son of Charles Manson in the comic book. Jeez, Nick Nolte! Any emotions I was supposed to feel with their relationship was lost with Nolte's scenery chewing. I bet he still has pieces of blue screen stuck in his teeth. I have the same kind of troubled relationship with my father and I felt nothing during those scenes except embarrassment for the actors. Not only were these scenes embarrassing but also unnecessary since they weren't based on the comic.

The fact of the matter is, in a comic book movie there just has to be a great villain. It's the villain that really makes these kinds of films. The best superhero films or just action films in general always have a strong actor playing the villain. Josh Lucas is a decent actor but not very striking and his character might as well have had a black hat and handlebar mustache. But wait...Bruce Banner's biggest enemy is himself, right? Right. But we really didn't need that explained to us for 2 and 1/2 hours!

And the final chase, while it was supposed to be beautifully poetic in the Ang Lee style, with Hulk jumping across the Southwest, ended up looking ridiculous and being nonsensical and boring. I don't remember him having the ability to do that in the comic and there's not much fun in watching a solitary figure fly through the desert. This scene might not have been longer than five minutes. But it seemed like an eternity. Why not have Hulk jump to the Vegas Strip while you are it? At least that would have been visually stimulating.

On the plus side, the acting by Eric Bana, Jennnifer Connelly and Sam Elliott was excellent. Especially, Connelly making a mountain out of a molehill of an underwritten role. She really showed the pain of loving someone who is emotionally unavailable (both her father and Bruce). Bana is actually very fortunate that this movie failed because it has freed him to take on a variety of interesting roles without being typecast or contractually obligated. Welcome to Hollywood, mate. Please stay!

Ang Lee is a fantastic director. But he was the wrong man for the job. No, he didn't write the script. But his writer James Schamus added a ton of his usual flourishes to the hacky script by John Turman and Michael France, leaving the viewer with two different movies HULK SMASHED together. The comic book panel scenes were a nice touch by Lee and he made the film visually interesting overall. But a different director could have taken the script and made something exciting out of it. (Look at the other films Michael France has written for example) So ""Hulk"", even with the pedestrian script and weak villain, could have been a lean, mean summer popcorn flick and a perfect set-up for sequels under someone else. Too bad. My rating 6/10.",6.0,3 December 2005
Unfortunately mostly boring,"I think the 2003 Hulk has artistic value. Not only the split screens which resemble panels of a comic book were a good approach, but also the different camera angles & shots which capture details. Also showing which thoughts the different characters have was a nice addition, but sometimes too dragging for an Action movie.

The first half felt almost relaxing and soothing, I think it's good they showed more than just blatant action. I also felt in love with the music score by Danny Elfman.

To compensate, there's action when Hulk shows and I think the CGI is good, there wasn't a moment where I cringed due to it in the important sequences.

But, if I was someone who went to the movies in 2003, what was there ? LOTR: Return Of The King, Matrix: Reloaded, Pirates Of The Caribbean, Kill Bill Vol. 1. Compared to these movies and more, Hulk is unfortunately very boring.

'Hulk' feels like an older movie but with CGI added and even if the movie has an artistic atmosphere and good pictures in it, it also puts you to sleep.",6.0,4 January 2019
Sets a new record in the stupid cinema,"Well, I'm sure this ""movie""(?) has already been the target of many hate and flame, to the point of being used as an icon of comparison when discussing other movies, as in ""almost as bad as the hulk"", or when trying to insult the doubtful qualities of a critic saying ""you're surely the kind that thinks the hulk was a good movie"".

I agree with all that, but it makes me think why also the mediocre mass of ignorance hunger that pays to see this film and its kind, flames it as if they'd want to revindicate the fact that they're not as stupid as the box office proves. Well, I suppose it's the same people that affirm to hate Bush, just because they think it's cool to hate him (but still voting for that donkey).

Not Incredible (get it? ha! I'm clever.),"Why? why why why why why why why? At least Marvel's older, crappier movies (The Fantastic Four, Captain America, Punisher) were so bad they were fun to watch. With the Hulk, we get what we've come to expect from the horde of new digital headaches that include most of Marvel's new films (save X-Men 2) A.) Yet another Marvel opening credits sequence where the ""camera"" rushes through some sort of bloodstream, DNA thingy, Spider-Web, etc. (you know what I'm talking about) B.) A long, drawn out ""origin"" scene that weighs down the movie (every person on earth knows how Spider-Man, Hulk, X-Men, Daredevil, et. al were created!!!! You didn't see this kind of heavy handed exposition in Batman, the standard by which all comic movies should be judged). C.) Stan Lee Cameo. This time accompanied by Lou Ferrigno--which, by the way, some jackass guy involved with the new Hulk movie on some MTV special had the audacity to proclaim that ""with current special effects technology"" there's ""no more use"" for someone like Ferrigno. Well, guess again. The look of the Hulk in this movie is about as convincing as Rolling Stone magazine calling Christina Aguilera ""sexy."" That is to say, not very convincing. And speaking of Christina Aguilera, she is actually uglier than the new hulk, which is all cute and babyfaced looking. They call him a mindless monster in the movie, but then he's all about saving the iddle bitty soldiers inside the tanks he smashes up and looking sad about doing it. I'll wind this up. The film is way too long (OVER 2 hours), I don't know why they got Ang ""everything is weightless and unconvincing"" Lee to direct it, there is a Punisher teaser preview before the movie (""They killed my family, and I'm going to Punish them!"" Wow! Here we go again, true believers!) and ultimately no ""Hulk Smash!"" line which I anticipated for two hours with baited breath (or popcorny breath) to no avail. There are a few good scenes in Hulk, but not enough to merit seven bucks. Unless you're a lady, that is, in which you get to see Bana's bare ass. I was excited when Marvel started getting some movie success, but now they are just churning out run-of-the-mill, shiny blockbuster crap (Daredevil, the upcoming Punisher, you name it) like Hulk.

First time seeing in 2023.,"Ang Lee's Hulk came out all the way back in 2003 and yet I never got around to watching it. The movie lives in the past and it's relevance to today is nonexistent. The plot is straight forward, however, a bit messy in delivery. The main focus is Bruce Banner and the serum that makes him the Hulk, and how the army is after to get him along with a lunatic who wants the serum for himself. Banner's father played by Nick Nolte is also a part of the madness. His story is tied in with Banner's grim childhood and then how Banner seeks revenge against his father towards the end, the final fight, cloaked in extreme darkness and hard to make out the action sequences. Eric Bana plays Bruce. Truthfully, I have never heard of Eric Bana, before or after this movie came out. Similar to Brandon Routh playing Clark Kent, they are both fine in their roles. They don't do anything wrong or perfect, but neither actor is mainstream. Jennifer Connelly as Betty and Sam Elliot as the General and Betty's father. I didn't find that there is a lot of chemistry between them and Betty's constant blank stare and gazing on the screen gets old really quickly. Neither, Connelly or Bana are given a lot of dialogue and their chemistry also comes off as distant. Hulk himself is well done. My favourite scenes are of him evading helicopters and taking massive leaps around beautiful scenery backdrops. The score by Danny Elfman is ok and effective at times.

Ang Lee forgot he's now in Hollywood!,"First, the CGI (Hulk himself) looks fantastic on big screen. I don't know why people (most of them from online reviews) keep saying he's just a bigger ""Shrek"". Well, he isn't, ILM has once again lived up to the expectations. More of him would be nice, I'd say!

All actors in major roles are great. Jennifer Connelly is solid (always looking sexy after all these years!). Nick Nolte is crazy but not over the top, you really do feel for his character. And Eric ""Hulk"" Bana makes a believable Bruce Banner. This is only his second films in US and with Troy next year, we'll sure see the best of him soon.

Finally, one thing that so far people haven't mentioned is that the style of Ang Lee, this is where the film being let down. I'm not talking about the ""split screen"" stuffs. It's the constant used of ""flashback"" and ""dreams"" sequences. This is very typical of Asia or to be exact, Chinese film making. You can almost see it in most Chinese drama movies. Luckly, he didn't use the ""slow motion"" which is a fav. of John Woo!

What it does to a big action film such as Hulk is slowing the pace of it. It's tedious and quite frustrated to see people keep going back to their past every 5 minutes.

If they decide to do a sequel soon, I'd say dumb Lee and go for a more traditional Hollywood type. Ang Lee is a OK director but somehow I don't think he's suitable for these kind of film.",8.0,29 June 2003
Enjoyable movie,"The Hulk was unexpectedly brilliant. It totally shocked me, I was expecting a major disappointment. This movie is jam packed with action from start to finish and the effects were visually stunning.

that's ok,"i'm not a big fan of action movie and thus nothing disappoints me in this new work of Lee. in fact i find it quite interesting. the action is impressive. i like the camera works also. the description to characters is ok, especially the inner world of scientists, although i would be happier if it can go a bit deeper. of course it's still much deeper than movies like Matrix Reloaded. perhaps it's no easy task to keep a balance between certain commercial elements and Lee's style. i'm not saying that Lee can't make a commercial-success movie. Crouching Tiger is an example. it's not the best work of Lee but certainly worth seeing. but of course please don't expect something like T2. 7/10",7.0,27 June 2003

Mixed Review--Mostly Bad,,6.0,21 June 2003
Hulk SLEEP!,"It is probably unfair of me to blame the failure of a past relationship on a film, but nonetheless I hold Hulk accountable for the pointless arguing it caused after I convinced my ex to see this this snoozefest.

I can't believe how much time I spent apologizing to my ex for my having convinced her to see such a mind-numbingly boring film as Hulk - because admittedly it's much easier to sleep during a boring film than it is to sleep when you're being nagged about dragging someone to see a boring film...

All of that aside, even two years later I am haunted by the experience of sitting in the movie completely and utterly uninvolved in the film I was watching. I had expected bad CGI from the trailers, but held out hope anyway...only to have them crushed by the weight of a big, lethargic green cartoon character. The 15 minute-long scene of Hulk bouncing around in the desert was so god-awful I was almost embarrassed for the artists that had spent their time working hard only to fail so miserably. Hulk's fight with the giant dogs was done at night probably in an attempt to hide the poor effects, but it was ultimately only successful in making the scene too dark to know what the hell was going on...not that I cared by that point.

The acting...well there's not much I can say about it because actors can only do so much with a script that moves slower than a glacier. Really, everyone involved with this film has done far superior work on other projects, and doubtless their failure here is due to the pacing of Ang Lee. Lee wanted this film to be a serious take on a comic book character, yet the film comes off as simply morose and uninteresting. Call me a fool if you will, but a good part of the $8 bucks I paid to see this film was spent to see a hopefully cool-looking Hulk smash stuff. I mean come on, Ang...this is Hulk, not Hamlet. When the day is done Hulk beats people up and throws tanks around, and when he does it he should at least look cool and not induce catatonia.

So in closing, yes I hated this film, because for me it broke the cardinal rule in that it was not entertaining. It was so boring that even my attempts to ridicule it throughout could not keep me from wishing for my time and money back. Needless to say at this point, but my ex- girlfriend was also bored to tears...but to her credit at least she had ME to blame for seeing this flaming dud of a blockbuster.

Save yourself the 2+ hours that this film takes in spinning its dull, ponderous web. You've got better things to do, I guarantee it.",3.0,27 April 2005
"""Hulk"" deserved to be more of a smash.","On a budget of $120 million, Hulk (2003) made $132 million. This makes me wonder, does this lower the bar for the box office expectations of the new Incredible Hulk movie, coming out in 2008. But first, I recommend you see this Hulk, in a different universe and starring Eric Bana, so you can compare the two. This Hulk is actually very good and was better than I had expected. But did its flaws really weigh it down?

If you've read the comic book series, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, you know the story - otherwise, I can't say much more. But it seems to play the typical mutation in comics, caused by a gamma ray experiment. The creation is the ""Incredible Hulk"" - a giant, green, muscle-bound creation of pure surprise and unexpectedness. As you've probably heard before, you won't like him when he's angry. I can't guarantee you'll like the movie either (a lot of people didn't) but the CGI animators were at the top of their game making this movie. And director Ang Lee won't be recognized for this film a lot in regards to his own work, but his own touch is clearly in the film, and you know what that means: greatness.

So, if you're checking out the new Hulk movie, try to at least rent this movie first. There's no saying you'll be glad you did, as many people didn't see that. But in my opinion it was a good movie, and worthy of a big old HULK-SMASH!",7.0,16 April 2008

Hulk Smashes!,"Where to begin? Just saw the redeye at the megaplex last night and I have to say after reading all the reviews that all of them are right to one degree or another.

The Hulk is a very ambitious film and the atmosphere created to host that ambition is flawed. Still, it manages to be more of a believable story given you understand that Eric Bana really is SCARED to death to be playing the role of Bruce Banner, a man who is perpetually scared to death. So I disagree that he did a bad job. In fact, he did it right since Bruce IS a cold fish who doesn't let anyone get close if he can help it because of his terror. Also people should remember that Bruce takes a long time AFTER he starts turning into the Hulk to unwind and become a real person. Before that he is an introverted genius who is so self absorbed that a cure is all he cares about. Before he realizes that the Hulk actually can do some good in the world, that is. Then he loosens up and begins to actually think he might manage to make a difference. This is shown in the last scene in the movie and with a tip of the hat to Bill Bixby as well.

The special effects are great if you are a microbiologist or geneticist. To the layman and the kids a lot of the more vivid scenes are merely swirls of color unless you can tell mitochondria from whole cells at a glance and are familiar with species of desert lichen. The figure of the Hulk himself is as perfect a comic book CGI adaptation as there has ever been. Ok, so there are some minor texture and coordination issues. Still it gives us a view of the Hulk we wish we'd seen on television years ago. What is being shown here that doesn't quite get through is that the Hulk is ultimately a product of the environment and thus, yet another part of nature. Ang Lee attempts to give us a broader picture, a wider angle on the drama that is life and still retain his signature look and feel to the film. I feel it succeeded but only if you know what to look for. Otherwise, I could see kids being put to sleep by it before being shocked awake by screeching metal and loud explosions. Which is kind of like reading a Hulk comic book...

Yes, I agree with those who say this movie has flaws and yes, I agree that this film captures the essence of The Hulk beautifully as no other visual media has ever before. One has to remember that, when one sees his powerful legs propel him from a building top that, by rights, should have been crushed or, at least damaged, if he did anything more than tiptoe lightly, there is a real need for a willing suspension of dibelief here. This reminds us that this is inspired by a comic book and yet, because of the purpose and the focus, manages to transcend the genre. You aren't seeing the ""older but wiser"" Hulk of today's comics. You are seeing the beginning of his development. I honestly think this movie will inspire sequels but that they won't have the same inner purpose this does. Ang Lee and The Hulk show us the beauty of being green and free and maybe that's the way we secretly all want to be ...",10.0,23 June 2003
Nice puppy ...,"Greetings again from the darkness. Another in a line of movie versions for comic book characters. For the most part these have been handled pretty well. ""The Hulk"" is no exception. Far from perfect, very adult, but mostly watchable. Director Ang Lee (who crafted the mesmerizing ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"")provides us with a dark, message-filled, CGI overloaded film that will not have you smiling or chuckling, but if you are over 18, you will find the story a bit unsettling. The story dwells on Bruce Banner's (played fine by Ausie hunk, Eric Bana) mysterious father (Nick Nolte) and the testing that occurred when Bruce was under 4 years of age. Bruce, of course, unwittingly follows in his mad scientist father's footsteps and ends up in a lab with the gorgeous Jennifer Connelly - we should all be so lucky. NOTE: If you have never seen it, make sure you check out Connelly in ""The Hot Spot"" from 1990 - it's a gem. The story takes off when Banner's dad reappears after 30 years with a couple of ""unstable"" pooches. The film does deliver the necessary HULK action, although at times the picture is muddled and it is difficult to tell what is happening. My biggest problem with the film is Ang Lee's attempt at creative filmmaking using the worthless split screen imaging and an onslought of close-ups. On the other hand, Nolte's performance, Connelly's face, Sam Elliott's snarling and Danny Elfman's score make this a winner. The casting was brilliant for the young Nolte and Elliott characters. And don't miss Lou Ferrigno (the orignial Hulk) and Stan Lee (creator of ""The Hulk"" and ""Spiderman"") walking out of a building together early in the movie.",6.0,24 June 2003
Could be one of the worst movies of all time,"I painfully sat through this boring movie. It was long, dull, and worst of all, it made no sense. the characters stunk. I cannot believe the garbage that Hollywood is coming out with. They didn't even try to come up with a good plot. They just tried to ride the Comic Book wave of crap that they are putting out. There was about 10 minutes of good action in the middle when the Hulk was throwing some tanks around. But sitting through what seemed like 5 hours of dribble is not worth it. If like the comic books, i would recommend Spiderman I and II. Do not watch this movie or Daredevil. They both stink. Rent this movie only to burn it, so no one else has to subject himself to it.",2.0,8 August 2004
Bill Bixby Would Be Appalled!,"Bill Bixby would be appalled if he were alive to see this disaster of the big screen version of The Hulk. The film almost had nothing to do with the TV version. Everything seemed to be way off, which includes a horrible storyline, lame acting with a slight exception to Jennifer Connelly who plays a similar role to that of the Oscar winning A Beautiful Mind which she also won best actress, and worst of all a CGI Hulk. I mean come on what is that! Not having Lou Ferrigno portray the titular role is one thing, but having it portrayed by CGI. Imagine having Superman designed that way! Even if they felt Ferrigno was too old, I'm sure they're were other bodybuilders that could've taken over. This is without a doubt the worst film adaption of a comic book hero. I sure hope Mr. Bixby is resting in peace!",,30 June 2004
What incredible Hulk?,"I had to wait to see a film that doesn't even deserve a two thumbs up, what a joke. The story is shown as a comic book with moving in it and live characters and the ending is Bruce Banner unleashing his rage on some dude in South America. spider-man and X-men are at least shown on the movie screen like other movies are, without split screens. The story has no villains except for the dumbest thing they come up with, Bruce Banner's father who gets mutant dogs to kill his girlfriend. The only incredible Hulk I see is an emotional wreck. The father as another angry green giant is hardly seen, you can barely see him. The scene where he tells Jennifer Connelly's character not to go in a room is stupid because their is nothing there, so he was afraid of nothing. For standing in line for an hour, It was sure not worth the wait.",6.0,8 July 2005
Hulk Review,"The main complaints I have about 2003's Hulk rely more on the technological difficulties of the time. I find that the Hulk from the MCU looks better. This Hulk looks action figure-like at times or even like a statue from a theme park. His green skin and purple pants seem too bright. As well, Absorbing Man would be better with more modern technology.

I find the characterization alright. It's definitely better than the Elektra film. Probably better if the villains would seem like bigger threats. It seems like the Absorbing Man issue was resolved a little too quickly

I feel like this would definitely be better if it was released today with modern CGI and keeps the same script. Maybe some changes to the script as well would make it better than just having better CGI.",6.0,2 June 2024
This is god awful,"Leave it to Marvel to forget what they do best and BS a story of the Hulk. I prefer the original Stan Lee story, but I guess that a classic isn't good enough for Hollywood. They didn't screw this bad with X-Men or Daredevil, but I guess the great run good movies is over.

This is a great Super Hero Action Flick.,"I really enjoyed this film. I was pleasantly surprised at the CGI of the Hulk. In the teasers it looked kinda cheesy, but in the actual movie it looked good. I thought the story and the performances were quite good. Nick Nolte, as Bruce Banner's mad scientist father, was outstanding, as usual. Jennifer Connelly showed why she's an Oscar winner. And Sam Elliot did a fine job playing the Army Four Star General bent on finding and destroying the Incredible Hulk. Eric Bana, in the title role, may not have been my first choice, but he was very good also.

I don't know why some people are slamming this movie. There was plenty of action, great special efx, a good story and good performances. What more could one want? I suppose there are those that don't want to allow any screen time for character or plot development. Just wham, bam! Give me the Hulk! We want two frickin' hours of just the Hulk smashing things. Huh, huhhh, huhhhhh, that'd be cool. Well, no thanks, Beavis.

I think Ang Lee did an outstanding job with the style and look of this film and showed why he's such a great film-maker. Hey look people, it's sci-fi fantasy derived from a comic book, for christ's sake. Have fun with it and enjoy. It's second only to Spider-Man (in this genre). And I only say that because I was always a bigger Spider-Man fan as a kid.

Good Director with big budget goes stupid,"How can I say the thousand of things gone wrong with this movie? I could maybe go with the scenery chewing performance of Nick Nolte. I could talk about the unnecessary use of split screen shots. I could talk about the new-agey smarmy poo that passes for a film score. I could go on and on about the heavy handed use of Psychobabble that tries to add depth and only drags this goofy mess into nothingness. I could see how the Budget probably tempted Ang Lee to try everything, like a freak show fat teenager at an all you can eat restaurant. On the same night I watched this yuck, Jackass the Movie, and The In Laws and I can truthfully say that Jackass is much better film. Ang Lee forgot one major factor when he did this, FUN. It was never for a nanosecond, FUN. This was a comic book, not War and Peace. There needs to be at least a fifteen year moratorium on making any more over-budgeted comic book movies, but as long as Hoolyweird has its way with teenage boys we will have more of this stuff until the loss of enough money stems the flow of garbage.",2.0,8 May 2004
Definitely NOT worth the wait,"I had received several movies from a friend last night one of which was The Hulk. It was the most horrendous comic book adaption I have seen(yes I am counting the last two Batmans and Superman IV the Quest for Peace). First they turn the whole premise on its head by having the cause of his transformation to be his father who was experimenting on him as a young boy. The experiment plus the radiation triggered David Banner's transformation. Second, the producers thought to turn Bruce into a total wimp which is supposed to make us cheer when he finally emerges as The Hulk. Bill Bixby's Bruce Banner was not a wimp and I don't think the comic book version was either. So why should this incarnation be? Jennifer Connelly is as always appealing eye candy and serves as the only person who can calm the Hulk's rage and transform him back into Bruce. Nick Nolte gives another redneck-from-hell performance as the elder Banner. The highlight for me were the cameos of Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee at the beginning of the movie. On a final note a friend of mine actually fell asleep watching it. That's the simplest review I've ever seen.",,20 August 2004
A few words Hulking in my mind...,"The Hulk, the latest blockbuster film spawned from the mind of Stan Lee, delivers what most fans wanted: smashing stuff. Although many scenes involved way too much drama and heavy psychological undertones, scenes in which Bruce Banner turned into Hulk were nothing short of amazing. And for being a 15 foot monster, he seemed very real and genuine. But the constant shift from looking deeper into a comic book alter-ego to crushing military choppers and flying through the air left me torn. Overall, I left the theater in approval. Now we can move on from Daredevil.",7.0,4 July 2003
Very slow but not bad,"This film is very, very slow. Also the fancy comic-book camerawork gets to be really annoying after a while. Despite this I still found a lot to enjoy about Hulk, I though Jennifer Connolly, Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot were good in their roles. Less so Eric Bana who was a bit bland and boring, I thought he was great in Chopper the only other film I've seen him in. I thought the CGI was great once we eventually got to see it. If they make Hulk 2 I hope they get another Director as I think this could have been a great film if Ang Lee wasn't so serious about everything, I feel really sorry for any young kids who went to see this they must have been bored stiff.

I'll tell you what happened here : Ang Lee.Action Fans do not want some artsy fartsy rendition of Pop Americana.Ang Lee would be fine if you want something in the likes of The Ice Storm,but for Hulk he just sucks.Most of the people I have talked to that have seen this have the same problems,and are as follows : # 1 - Hulk Dogs.Hulk Dogs ??? Okay I can live with that......but a Poodle ? What genius thought of that idea ? # 2 - Bruce Banner's Dad was a sick, twisted,murdering individual....not a sick,twisted,murdering super villain.Who's brilliant idea was THAT one I wonder ? # 3 - Transitions every few seconds for no apparent reason.Hey Ang,you're making a movie about a comic,not a movie INTO a comic ! Boy did those grate on my nerves.... # 4 - The apparent lack of any coherent direction.Someone tell me exactly where the direction was in this picture ??? This movie presented itself as a collage of unfinished ideas slapped together with all the precision of a first year film student.Horrible. # 5 - The ending.The worst ending I have ever seen in a superhero movie aside from the inept low budget Captain America from the nineties.Can you say anti-climatic ??? How about boring ? # 6 - The pacing.Before we even see the Hulk the story moves along at a snails pace.I almost fell asleep.Alright,now that I've said what drove me absolutely batty about the trainwreck called "" Hulk "" let me say what was done correctly.Unlike alot of other people I had no problem with the way The Hulk looked.I think that he was probably the most realistic character this side of Golem in any CGI movie ever made.What was he doing stuck in such a boring movie like this ? I also liked the character of General Ross.Nice performance there Sam.Great as usual.That's what was so sad about this movie as a whole : it had great actors, but it lacked any coherent direction or intriguing story.Someone should have told Avi Arad that you need to find a good writer and director as well......Truth be told I hope there is a sequel.Why ? Maybe they'll get it right the second time around.As it stands now,the t.v. show with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno was a whole lot better.My favorite comic character flushed down hollywood's toilet.What a waste.

"Good film, but now needs a fun follow up.","Its not that bad. The CG Hulk is amazing and there are great hulk effects. The screen play is well constructed and the plot well delivered. Overall this is a good film.

3 things let it down.

1. It takes itself far to seriously.

2. There is a lack of emotional depth. This can be pinned on the slightly limp performances of Banner and Connely.

3. The film only really deals with how the hulk came to be, and ends where things might get really interesting. ie when he goes off into the world on is own.

Hopefully they will make another and have a bit more fun with the possibilities of the indestructible green man. (and don't make the Hulk smaller so people can empathise with him) I did hear such talk, he's the hulk, your supposed to run from him not think he's sweet.",7.0,11 June 2005

"Thank you Ang Lee, thank you very much!","After seeing Ang Lee's ""THE HULK"" at the Premier Tuesday night (6/17/03), I just have to say to everyone involved with this project... ""THANK YOU!"" It was everything I hoped it would be, and more.

First let me qualify my review by saying I'm not much of comic book buff, but for some reason I've always been drawn to the stories of The Hulk & Spiderman. I can relate to these two guys. They've always been very real to me, unlike many of the other Comic Book Hero's we all know and love. So I was understandably torn between excitement and concern when I heard each of these Films was being made.

""SPIDERMAN"" certainly didn't disappoint me at all, but I wasn't nearly as connected to him as I was to `THE HULK.' Growing up watching the TV show, I definitely had a level of expectation for Ang Lee's Film that would be very hard to meet. Well let me tell you, Ang Lee, along with his Cast & Crew, have succeeded in not only meeting my expectations, but they have surpassed them with huge, mile covering leaps & bounds.

Now I'm not going to try to rebut any of the many criticisms I've heard about this Film. I'm sure those critics are at least as hard to please as I am, and probably just as stubborn. You didn't like it? That's cool. No, I don't think you missed anything. You just didn't like it. A lot of other people probably won't like either. However, I did like it. In fact, I liked it a lot. I believed it. It's as simple as that. I absolutely believed it. For the 1st time, I actually believed that Bruce Banner and The Hulk was the same person. It really came through in his eyes. I saw and felt everything Bruce/The Hulk was going through. And again, I believed it. They were actually able to make Bruce Banner look like `The Hulk' (and vice versa), instead of having to replace one Actor with another Actor who was a lot taller and worked out a lot more. Oh please don't get me wrong, I LOVED the original HULK. I never missed a single episode. Lou Ferrigno was awesome (and still is). But every time David Banner got angry on the TV Show and turned into The Hulk, I always knew that it was a different Actor. What Ang Lee was blessed with the ability to do in this Film is something they only dreamed they could do back then.

What I liked most about the Film is that Bruce Banner as The Hulk doesn't just get mad & smash everything he sees. Well okay, maybe the 1st time we see him as The Hulk he's doing some mindless smashing. But after that his reactions are the direct result of the attacks being made on him. And during these moments in the Film I not only want him to, but I absolutely need him to react the way he does. And I want to stand up & cheer each time he makes it through one of those amazing battles. This is where Ang Lee's thoughtful and inspired vision really comes through. He seems to have successfully captured the deeper, human origin of The Hulk, which is the part of the story I relate to and enjoy the most.

Another aspect that I was very impressed with was the growth of The Hulk as a character through the course of the Film. We get to see him develop from birth into someone who's at least somewhat aware of his own abilities. I think Ang Lee presents this aspect of the story in a masterfully subtle way.

And as far as the acting goes I thought Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Sam Elliott, Nick Nolte, and Josh Lucas all did wonderful work throughout the entire Film. I'm tempted to go on about their work, but I'll hold off for fear of spoiling any parts of the Film for anyone. Suffice to say they all did a great job of keeping me thoroughly engrossed throughout the entire Film.

Well that's about it. I totally enjoyed Ang Lee's version of THE HULK. I went into it with some pretty high and unrealistic expectations. But please let me say again, Ang Lee, along with his Cast & Crew, have succeeded in not only meeting my expectations, but they have surpassed them with huge, mile covering leaps & bounds.

I would recommend this Film to anyone who asked. I'll be back in line Friday to see it again, and again.",10.0,18 June 2003

The Hulk (Dumb and Dumberer in disguise!),"I was unfortunate enough to go to a preview showing. Way too long--over 2 hrs. 15 min.--too short on plot, and details that would put you to sleep. It couldn't fill 30 min. of a decent sit comedy. A violent portrayal of an entertaining television program with an over the top performance by Nick Nolte, obviously taken from his recent encounter with the law, including that now-famous hair style. Theatre was filled will all age groups and the audience's laughter at some of the intense? emotional? scenes pretty much indicated the reaction by conversations overheard as we walked out. Waste of time, even for free. The Hulk himself became 4-5 times or larger than a normal human being...next time, bring back Lou for the role rather than just the cameo at the beginning.

"Lacklustre, obtuse superhero movie disappoints and repels.","There's been a wave of revival for the old superhero genre in the past 2 years. We have been presented with exciting comic-strip adaptations such as `X-Men' and `Daredevil'. The fifth in line is `Hulk'. You may have noticed that they changed his name from `The Incredible Hulk' to just plain `Hulk'. I suppose the reason for that is because they didn't want the franchise to seem campy. And `campy' is certainly no way to describe the movie. Those expecting a `Batman Forever' style succession of cheesy jokes and stylish action will be disappointed.

For what lies ahead on screen is something that no one was hoping for or wanted in the first place. If you've seen the TV spots/ teaser trailers, you'll find that they portray it in a good vs. evil style, which is totally misleading. If the producers didn't want audiences to be disappointed, they should have been more truthful in the previews. This is different from most superhero movies, but not in a good way. The main problem is that it lacks the feel of a comic book film.

All is done in such a monotonous `what do we do now?' scientific way, that it's hard to believe this could be compared to `Spiderman', `X2' et al. Ang Lee utilises the split-screen technique to achieve a comic style look, but completely fails. The method was totally overused and not once did it remind me of a paper-ish look. It just seemed like Lee was showing off, using that which was completely irrelevant to begin with.

On the plus side, there are generally good performances all across the board. Aussie Eric Bana is perfectly cast as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk. Just as good is Academy Award winner Jennifer Connelly who is inspired and substantial as counterpart Betty Ross. Nick Nolte is er, Nick Nolte. Not much he can do about that. And there is also generally good support from Josh Lucas and Sam Elliott. Most important is the CG work on the Hulk himself. Initial doubts that he would look unrealistic have departed. The model work/ conceptual art is solid and ultimately synthetic.

The real flaw here is the script. It lacks first view thrills, jump scenes and the overall effect is deadening and unexciting. Stylised action is put on hold for the most part; opting for psychobabble and poorly conceived emotional sequences. The pay-off is good, but with such a long wait it should have been better. At 138 minutes, there are plenty of `technical' scenes that could and should have been excised from the already lengthy script.

The weakest effort in the comic book revival yet, `The Hulk' shares very close resemblance to `King Kong'. Truly a great concept in search of a script to match. A stylish cover isn't matched up with a cold, sterile core. Far from a total disaster, it still should please those who are fans of the original comic. Nevertheless, this is lacklustre filmmaking and a rather bland effort from renowned director Ang Lee. My IMDb rating: 4.8/10.",,1 August 2003
How do you force a concept into submission?,"Force? Submission? Well, let me explain. Movies are a lot different from comics, and presently there isn't room to make a comic adaptation into a movie without recurring to known formulas or marching into a too many times charted territory. At the time of release of this picture, the Batman, X-Men, Daredevil, Spawn, Superman and many other adaptations have been released, some with success, some without, some needing to be revived, some needing to be killed once and for all. And also, The Hulk is probably one of the most difficult characters to adapt to movies because his powers rely on strength and destruction, not on fly-bys, jumps, athletic qualities and state-of-the-art machinery. So how could Ang Lee pull this off? Frankly, you need some particular vision and flare to turn a movie about a beastly man into a thrilling ride, and even so, you'll have to dedicate a lot of time to the characters and the main story to be able to unleash hell in the second half without turning the movie into a caotic festival of mayhem. So Ang Lee tries in every shot to state the point that he wants this one to be different. And indeed, as he splits the screen in tens of separate vignettes, when he makes transitions that look like a panoramic shot over a comic book page, and when the story (in a frankly innovative move) puts allies and enemies in such a close, almost familial relationship, the result must really be different. But is it good afterall? Well, it's really a set-piece creator, jointing pictures and concepts that, while no landmarks in the history of movies, are eye candy to the max. But there are some strange things going around in this obsession with making this one so unique - the split screen option is funny at start, but then it is just another baroque gimmick. The actors are no stand-outs, and even the staring Eric Bana doesn't look like he's really inside the complex emotions his character experiments. Nick Nolte is probably the best, in a wicked creation that generates at the same time empathy and repugnance. But it's great fun and as a popcorn ride is above average - the Hulk sequences in the desert and the final showdown are at some points jaw-dropping. But don't look to closely or you will find that all that green skin can at some point turn into normal fare again - and is not for watching Bruce Banner that we came into the theatre in the first place.",7.0,21 July 2003
"""Grr....all hulk wanted was hug from daddy..........""","The hulk was a lot different from the all action smash em up I was hoping for. Rather than a straight up live action comic book action adventure in the vein of the Spiderman or x-men films , ang lee has presented the hulk as an emotion driven art movie that happens to have a giant green monster in it . Its an ambitious attempt to add depth to a superhero movie ,and while its mind blowing in some places its not entirely successful.

When the hulk does his trademark temper tantrums of mass destruction , its very entertaining to watch as he destroys tanks , mutant killer dogs and fighter jets . But all the stuff in between is a bit hit and miss. There are a lot of revelations that occur in the story but the characters are so casually played that these plot developments are not as shocking and moving as they should be when they occur .

As for ILMs hulk , all the money and complex development techniques used to create him was worth it to an extent - it does look amazing , but only from certain angles . Close up he looks as real and organic as every human actor in the film , but from a distance he looks a kind of video game character .

Hulk is a very different kind of comic book movie ,that's of an acquired taste and while it wasn't the best way to interpret the comic in movie form , its definitely got some great ideas and its miles ahead of many a superhero flick in terms of artistic integrity .",7.0,8 July 2005

A victim of its own ambition,"This 'comic' movie has been done like none before it. It has been done by a serious director in a serious way and, in the most part, pulls its off. This in itself is a rare thing making a movie about a 15 foot green giant serious. There is no humour in this movie, it takes itself very seriously. As others have said, the performances are all very good - perhaps too good. I think in the most part this movie has trouble getting an audience. Because there is no humour and the emotions dealt are very 'adult' the kids get restless whenever the green giant is not on screen. And for the adults, well they didn't come to see Shakespeare and for them to accept this as serious cinema might be hard for them to admit - even to themselves. The acting is great, the CGI is faultless. But the subject matter could do with lighting up and the editing could be a bit sharper - knock maybe a good 45 mins off the top.",7.0,27 June 2003

How do the pants stay on?,"I went to see the HULK on Saturday despite reading some mixed reviews. I liked the first part of the movie which was making me think it was going to be like Darkman but 15 minutes the after ""the accident,"" I was wondering if he was ever going to change at all. As in Daredevil, there was way too much back story, and the plot conveniances were a bit much. Some of the CGI scenes are so dark you can't tell what's going on. Despite its flaws I did like the comic book paneling done through some of the movie and the cameo with Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno was pretty awesome. The CGI worked for most of the movie, but there wasn't much in the way of bad guys to balance out the hulk. Having the hulk attacked by a guy in crutches is kinda.. pathetic? The biggest weaknesses though were that the movie ran too long and the story line too complex when we just wanted to see some smashing.

"Some great action, its a shame about the story.","Hulk was one of my favourite comic book hero's, he is great so my expectations for this film were a little high. Now I am going to hate myself for doing this but.......the film needed to be dumbed down a bit.

The story although OK got a bit confusing and there was no real explanation for the things that were happening. That combined with the fact that when they did explain things you still didn't understand because Nick Nolty mumbled his way though his line during the whole film. Also the big fight at the end of the movie just leaves you scratching your head going HUH??? The basics of the story is not the HULK, so hulk fans beware.

The action was 100% Fantastic it almost felt lifted straight from the comic, Its fast paced and epic. However there is not enough of it, so you get bored allot sitting through a story that just drags. As soon as the Hulk is on screen though wake up. Hulk fans this is HULK action, straight from the comics. Some of my friends thought it was silly when he jumps a few miles, but hey he does that in the comic all the time.

The effects are also fantastic, there are a few questionable scenes where they look a little dodgy but the Hulk who is 100%CG looks pretty cool throughout the movie.

The acting is also superb and i would give them all an A+ with the exception of Nick Nolty who in my opinion was one of the reasons the film was not as good as it could've been.

It is a shame really that a film with Great acting and Great action, is let down by a story that over complicates quite a basic concept....oh and Nick Nolty.

So HULK fans beware this film takes some liberties with the story but check out the action. People with Kids have the remote ready to fast forward to the action. For non comic book fans, stay away.",6.0,11 July 2006

He was big and strong and ready to take on all comers but they may as well have had a censor dot fighting the bad guys, then we would at least be left with a sense of mystery and possibly awe.

An Honest Review,"Well, let's be honest Eric Bana didn't bring the charm to the role that Mark Ruffalo does, but to be fair you don't get the sense that he took this as much as a serious acting role as Ruffalo does.

In fact, it makes you sort of wonder what Ruffalo doesn't take seriously.

And Eric Dana isn't exactly believable as a scientist or really as a tormented soul. He's always just sort of there. Always ready to be surpassed.

In other words, the movie suffered from bad casting. Jennifer Connelly, really, love her to death, but she has as many issues emoting as Kristen Stewart and throwing her into a role like this is asking for her to phone it in.

So the film suffered.

And then the plot itself...well, if you read comics, you come in expecting to see the Hulk jump around in a blind rage and destroy things...and you got that in spades. In respect to the source material, it wasn't really that bad.

The problem here is the casting. In the Hulk you expect a lot of mindless carnage and destruction so in movies about the Hulk, you need actors that can breathe real life into the action. You just don't have that here.",4.0,16 November 2016

Bottom of the Marvel barrel,"I remember seeing this movie when it was quite new - almost 20 years ago. I hated it, and all these years it has remained in my ""worst movies ever lists"". But since many years have passed and I have seen many bad movies I thought it's fair to give it another chance. Maybe it's not as bas as I remember?

I usually watch movies in one sitting, often even two movies in a row, but rarely when I'm too tired I stop the movie halfway and continue the next evening. Well, when I watching hulk again it took me... four nights just to see this one movie. I'm not even kidding. The first night I watched maybe half of it, but every next night when I tried to watch the rest I started to feel so dead sleepy I just couldn't finish. And I'm a preson with problems with falling to sleep. But this movie puts me to sleep like a drug.

To not make this review overtly long, let's try to pinpoint the issues. 1. The cgi is the worst ever. That's what I thought years ago and that's how I feel today. A very digital hulk doesn't look like he belongs to the same picture as the background. And he doesn't just smash walls which would be the thing to do, he jumps on mountain tops which looks ridiculous. Other characters are not much more interesting. Not even the woman played by Jennifer Connelly whom I adored in Dark City. And the overall visual look of the film is dull to look at, it has a weird grey tone.

The only thing I actually liked was the occasional panels of multiple images like in comic book pages. It shows they tried to do something.

But it's absolutely one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. And I've seen it twice and survived to tell about it.",1.0,5 August 2023
Obviously It Is Not Easy Being Green.,"A long and pointless ride into nothing that is overblown and almost totally void of any merit. ""Hulk"" is of course based on the famous comic strip which became a minor television series success in the late-1970s. However, this character lacks everything that superheroes like Superman, Batman and Spider-Man have. It is the late-1960s and a mad governmental scientist (Paul Kersey) is trying to improve on himself and go beyond the work of God. Naturally military man Todd Tesen is worried about Kersey's work and knows that his research could be potentially dangerous for all of mankind. Kersey (who ages to become Nick Nolte) soon has a son (Eric Bana) and that son grows up to do scientific work as well. Tesen's (who ages to become Sam Elliott) estranged daughter (Jennifer Connelly) also ironically becomes a research worker in the same lab. Bana and Connelly shared a short-lived romance that was broken off because of Bana's inability to show deep emotion. Soon Bana's believed-to-be-dead father comes back and soon the Hulk does show himself for the first time. Elliott realizes that the titled character poses national security risks as Nolte continues to have possibly deviant plans for his son. Also along for the ride is scientist/opportunist Josh Lucas who has plans of his own for Bana. Director Ang Lee (who has always been over-rated, especially for films like ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") continues to show numerous shortcomings as a film-maker. His problems are more pronounced in a special effects-heavy production like this. ""The Hulk"" wants to be thought-provoking and deep, but ends up being down-right dull and boring most of the time (the fact that the Hulk does not show up until about an hour into the movie did not help either). Dependable performers like Jennifer Connelly and Nick Nolte seem out of place in this film. Ultimately they are left to carry ""Hulk"" and they cannot overcome the other problems associated here. Eric Bana (who hit gold in ""Black Hawk Down"") is an odd choice for this movie. He is not near as good as the late Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno were in the television series (as mediocre as it was). Overall ""Hulk"" was way too long, too bulky, too silly and way too incoherent to even make an impression with me. Watch for Ferrigno and creator Stan Lee (no relation to Ang) early on as security guards. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,29 July 2003
The Hulk,"The Hulk focuses far too much on the storyline of how Bruce Banner became the hulk but people don't want to see Bruce Banner for 3/4 of the movie we want HULK and lot's of him.Unfortunately we overall get like just over 30 minutes of Hulk and maybe 45 minutes of overall action not what you want in a film about a huge angry monster trashing stuff and wasting people.Instead we receive more of a drama and without the few and far between action sequences this would've been a really good drama.This movie really makes you connect with the characters and they really give each of them a huge back story and a lot of depth but honestly this is the wrong movie for that.Comic geeks will more than likely hate this movie because it doesn't have hulk smashing the crap out of everything for an hour and a half instead they get an emotionally driven forbidden love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross.The camera angles are really cool in this film i love how they show many of the scenes from three different angles and perspectives it was a very original and unique aspect of the film.The Hulk looked alright I suppose but he was first off way too big and way too fictional looking the whole time you're think that's so graphics.People weren't ready for a love story filled with passion,angst,and unjust situations that force it's audience to feel what the characters feel people just wanted The Hulk to have just enough story and character development to help us understand and then scene after scene of the incredible hulk causing destruction and mayhem and i guess i sort of was too.I respect and enjoyed this completely different and unique take on The Hulk and what he is all about as a person and how his actions effect both who he loves and who he hates.Overall fantastic acting,great characters, and a different interpretation unfortunately with very little action and too much talk.Not enough Hulk too much Bruce Banner 7 out of 10.",6.0,11 January 2007
Better than expected.,"I had my doubts about hulk being transferred to the big screen. Thought that he was too cartoonish to be a believable realistic character. X-men for example was a comic book movie too but you could buy what was going since it tried to be realistic. After watching the hulk though, he was still cartoonish but I accepted the fact that he could exist in that world. The problem I have with the film is the excessive use of fancy transitional effects. There was an abundant use of multiple onscreen frames likely used to simulate comic book pages but that eventually began to hurt my eyes and became a distraction since you couldn't focus on a single frame without ignoring the others. Hulk is a decent movie but it suffers by being way too much like a comic book which in the past, of early comic book films (fantastic four), brought the genre down.",6.0,20 June 2003

The character played by Nick Nolte was awful, played no useful role in the movie and killed all momentum that was generated. Cut out every mention of his character, every scene he's in and the movie would jump to 8/10. (Hello shortened directors cut!?) NICK NOLTE KILLED THIS MOVIE. Sam Elliott chews up the scenery and is always fun to watch. Jennifer Connelly is smashingly beautiful (and a wonderful actress) as the love interest Betty Ross. Eric Bana makes an interesting choice for Bruce Banner. More buffed then would be expected based on the comics, but he's a good actor modifying his role to suit himself. The character of the Hulk was impressive. Some didn't like the computer generated Hulk, I did. Hulk battling the tanks and the creatures...generally causing mayhem is what the fans want to see.

A miserable confused experience,"Wow. Justjust wow. Dear god in heaven. This film is one of the worst, most sorry excuses for coherent cinema I have ever seen, it's bad but it's the worst kind of bad, it's 'no fun at all' bad, it's 'cry out for humanity' bad, it's don't even think of trying to watch by yourself bad. This movie is horrendous. In order to go over how this movie fails across the board I have to go over the worst aspects one by one. Acting: this film's acting is some of the worst I have ever seen. None of the actors or actresses give believable performances, everyone sounds like they're here for their paychecks. Effects: this film uses primitive CGI and so the effects are horrible you can practically see the little numbers and lines from production. Story: this movie has one of the most needlessly complicated plots I have ever tried to slog through; characters do random inexplicable things, nothing makes sense, clichés manage to work their way in there, and with a concept like Hulk its amazing that this film manages to be no fun at all, there's a scene where Hulk's dad sends a trio of hulk dogs to try and kill the love interest forsome reason and hulk has to fight them, about one fourth of the way through the scene you're bored. Let me say that again, a scene with the incredible Hulk fighting a trio of Hulk dogs becomes BORING!!! Music: the music is uninspired and lazy, Danny Elfman at his worst which is frustrating because Darkman and Nightbreed have proved that the man can do so much better. Tone: this film is way, way too serious, it has not the first clue what kind of material it's working with and tries to do it's best to create a thought provoking movie, It fails. Cinematography: this movie goes for a really really pretentious visual style with big wide far away shots, mainly of deserts, instead of giving a sense of scale which I think was the intention it just makes the film feel big and hollow. The editing: this is where I actually have my biggest problem with this movie: this film's visual style is so out of place and so jarring it actually breaks the illusion. Not even the worst Ed Wood movies did that for me. Ang Lee seems to be playing a game called 'transition the scene in a different way ever time', sometime the next scene slides across, sometimes it comes out from the centre, sometimes it comes from on top and once it even flow upward all wavy like water. I am not kidding. Aside from the scene transition game this movie also tries to have a style which brings comics book panels to mind with two different but related scenes or even the same scene but from different angles happening right next to the each other with a thick black line in-between. The comic book panel thing is creative and in a better movie it might have worked but this is a movie that's going out of its way to be serious a thought provoking, it can't do that with comic book panels and clumsy scene transitions. This movie is a black hole of fun, Hulk is one of the most simple and fun concepts in all of superherodom but this movie sucks it all away, the movie's two hour runtime and lacklustre feel mean that it overstays it's welcome fast. The only good I could possibly see this film bringing is as an endurance test for the most die-hard cults of bad movie fanatics. Every copy of this film needs to be hunted down and destroyed, with fire, it's the only way aside from maybe silver bullets.",1.0,4 April 2016
Somewhat underrated and misunderstood,,9.0,7 June 2023
Ang Lee is both the film's blessing and curse...,"'The Hulk' is the most interesting and original approach to a 'Hollywood blockbuster' that I've watched in a long time. It's also the most problematic and for that you can thank Ang Lee, who a certain webslinger would call both the film's blessing and curse.

'Hulk' looks stunning - some typical art cinema symbolic shots, others so beautiful you want to frame them. Even the action sequences - which, despite the Hulk's much criticised CGI are great - have a real poetry in their rhythm. A lot of comic-style screen wipes and camera zoom-outs as well as split screen techniques to try and establish pace too. Also, this is FAR more character and psychologically-driven then any blockbuster I've watched before. You really feel for the Banner/Hulk character - a real feeling of pathos and tragedy surrounds him (Lee pays homage to the original Frankenstein at one point with a scene by a pool and the 'tragic monster' similarities are plain throughout).

The problem is that you also expect certain things of a comic book film and you can't help but feel that Lee struggled to compromise himself for the audience that 'Hulk' will appeal to. That's to be applauded at one level - but, at another, it made it a distinctly uneasy mix. The film is almost uniformly downbeat in tone and, when Ol'green skin doesn't appear for the first 45 mins, it becomes a little gruelling despite setting up some fine melodrama. Also, the rhythm is of the film is uneven because the Hulk sequences are so energised up to the rest of the film. The fancy editing and techniques talked about above are used in strange places sometimes - they're refreshing but whether they add to the film's 'feel' is questionable.

Overall, you have to applaud Ang Lee for attempting what he has - it works on some levels and it's astonishing that he had the artistic freedom to do it (you can clearly see where the 'Hollywood' stops and Ang Lee starts). But the mix is also a problematic one as its far less 50-50, more 75-25 in favour of Lee and it is easy to see why audiences have had real trouble with accepting it. Personally, I hope he gets the sequel - am sure that, with mainstream action practice now under his belt, he could refine it to be an absolute classic film. But I dunno if studios will take the chance again. A valiant effort, but flawed masterpiece or interesting failure? Hard to tell.",6.0,5 August 2003
A convoluted and boring mess,"Back in 2003, before Marvel created their 'Cinematic Universe' and started to explore their more obscure, lesser-known characters, superhero movies were starting to hit their stride. Origin stories such as Bryan Singer's X-Men (2000) and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002), while certainly far from perfect, demonstrated just how fun these movies could be without sacrificing plot or character development for the sake of a set-piece. Ang Lee's Hulk took this idea a tad too far, delving into the psyche of its not-particularly- interesting protagonist and forgetting that this is a movie about a giant green rage-monster who smashes things to pieces.

Dr. Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) works with his former girlfriend Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) at the Berkeley Biology Institute, experimenting on cell repair using gamma radiation. Due to a mysterious, traumatic event when he was a child, Banner is haunted by the vague memories he has of his parents, now believed to be dead. Naturally, one of his experiments goes awry and he is exposed to a dangerous level of radiation, which allows him to turn into a big green monster whenever he gets angry. His father David (Nick Nolte) turns up alive to complete the experimentation he was prevented from completing by Betty's father Thaddeus (Sam Elliott), who imprisoned him for 30 years. Learning of David's return and Bruce's new power, Thaddeus will not stop at nothing to take them both down.

I remember quite liking Hulk when I first saw it back in the cinema, but watching it again 13 years later, I found it a convoluted, and quite frankly boring, mess. There are a couple of things to admire, such as Lee's attempt to translate the comic to screen with the use of multiple split-screen, but this device is employed too often, and in situations that don't really call for it. Nolte is also enjoyable to watch, as he is let loose to the point where it seems like he has wandered onto the set after a particularly heavy binge. However, the film spends far too much time with a mopey Bruce as he struggles with the memories of the past. When the action finally comes, the special effects just aren't up to scratch, even by 2003's standards, and the climax is a confusing muddle of giant clouds obscured even further by the fact that the picture is too dark to make out what is happening. Hopefully, if Marvel ever make a standalone movie with Mark Ruffalo, they will finally get the character right (fingers crossed for Planet Hulk!).",4.0,12 August 2016

I really enjoyed Nick Noltes preformance as bruce banners father. Ang lee deserves most of the credit for turning this comic book adaptation into a cinematic masterpiece. I'm predicting hulk to break the weekend record with about 118 million in it's first weekend alone.

"Boring, long Marvel movie---3/10","I just came back from watching this crap and i have mostly negative things to say, but first i want to say that Ang Lee is a great director but a lot of the direction in this movie gave me a headache. Too many shots of DNA and molecules spliced into where they don't belong. The only good things about this movie is Nick Nolte and Jennifer Connelly, the former for some great acting and funny moments, and the latter for being something nice to look at during an otherwise horribly boring flick. The action scenes were pretty decent, but not frequent enough. The story sucked. Maybe because i am not a Hulk fan. I did enjoy watching him destroy things but other than this the movie falls flat. Only if your a die-hard Hulk fan should you see this. Otherwise, i would steer clear. 3/10",3.0,20 June 2003
Hulk ... ? maybe ... Incredible? ... not by a long shot,"I'll start by saying that this movie gets a 6.5/10 ... Here's the breakdown ... What follows is the ""Bad News""

1. This movie really has nothing for acting. First and foremost, who is Eric Bana? No, seriously, like, I've never seen this guy before. If you're going to try for a blockbuster movie, let's pick a blockbuster lead? I have a feeling we won't see much more of Mr. Bana after this.

2. Why did Josh Lucas have such a small part? Why did Sam Elliott's part take him to the depths of dull? Neither of these actors, both far more capable than our leading man, were put to the highest of their potential.

3. What was with the beginning of this movie? Flashback, flashforward, flash-to-middle-of-dream ... I mean, come on, I haven't seen that much jumping around since, well, EVER! Give us something to build off ... I left the theater still wondering where some of those scenes came from ... come on now ...

4. The CG was ""incredibly"" overdone ... that's about all I have to say about that ...

5. Ok, there is absolutely no reason this movie needed to be as long as it was ... cut out, oh, I dunno, the first HOUR of this movie and it probably would be much better.

Ok, and now the ""Good News"" (AKA, the part that kept me awake)

1. The scene with the destruction of the tanks was very cool (unfortunately, we saw that in the trailers)

2. The dog fight (as CG as it was) was at least able to make me sit up a little bit from the slouch I was in.

3. As small as his part was, Josh Lucas played a great villain (had his part been expanded, this well could be a 7.5 out of 10)

4. This movie was released at the same time as the huge and sudden influx of comic book hero movies ... why is this good? Maybe it will be overlooked by the much more powerful X-Men movies ...

Overall, this movie PROBABLY deserves less than what I'm giving it. However, I'm keeping this 6.5 because of one other reason; I believe that this movie, more than any of the other comic book movies, sought to keep a little piece of the comic books in the film. How so? Many of the scenes contained box-style viewing, a classic for fans of comic books. Though, at times, this was slightly annoying, it created a different viewing style that moviegoers aren't so used to. Furthermore, as little as I know about the original comic (hence, no comments were made about that above) I have heard that the movie was pretty true to its backing, a trait I greatly respect and like to see. Would I recommend running out to see this? No. But when it comes out on video, it might be worth the rental fee to check it out.

Gray or Green,"A story that has evolved and devolved since 1939, this newest rendition of the Green (Gray?) monster's tale is about as interesting as the earlier ones. There are fans of comics that can differentiate the various geneses of Hulk eras, and can expostulate on the running characters or the Creature himself (there even has been a She Hulk!) in monologues as boring as those in Ang Lee's version of `The Hulk'. This is an incredible waste of time.

Generally speaking any movie from which a video game can be made is sure to be dull or flat-out bad. In this incarnation, a scientist is bathed with gamma rays in a botched experiment, making him prone to becoming an enraged and socially dangerous monster. We immediately wonder (not being moved by the unfortunate accident), since he was not exactly a warm human being beforehand, why the people in his life care about him; we certainly don't.

This to point out the completely implausible attraction of Jennifer Connelly (playing Betty Ross) to either his ugly self or his normal self; he just ain't lovable. The only chemistry discernable between them involves a laboratory, as this is an asexual and non-sexual non-thriller.

Jennifer Connelly is wasted  no, wait; everyone is wasted  in this movie. It really is about The Hulk throwing things or pummeling stuff. Sam Elliott, as a military commander intent on destroying the creature, is fun to watch. Nick Nolte, looking like the first homeless scientist we have seen, is certainly given license to do whatever he wants, but cannot or does not convey any sense of concerned fatherhood we can understand or know.

The use by director Lee of panel drawings split screened into the film is interesting, and will be much copied in the future. This was well telegraphed before the movie was released, and drew some film fans in, but does not redeem it in any way. And it hardly moves us to relate to others that the movie is a must-see. It really is designed for viewers ages 8-12. They can tolerate a 138 minute (should have been 90) sitting better than any.

Fans of comic book characters projected onto the big screen must find any conversation a frustrating interlude. Mostly we see Jennifer Connelly crying a lot after one of another of Eric Bana's (our un-Hulk human actor) frustrating misadventures. But when conversation does occur it, as is required in comic-based movies, is so serious and therefore laughably rendered that we surely itch for him to be prodded into greenness (grayness?) via a paper cut, stubbed toe or SOMETHING.

This is not really what the big screen is for; this movie is made with big screen TV viewers in mind. A really comfortable chair is necessary for this one.

CGI are wonderful!! People need to review their own concepts.,"I wonder why people keep complaining about the CGI in the movie, as if the special effects were the main character of the movie. It is NOT. Bruce Banner's wicked mind is.

Moreover, IF CGI was the main character of the movie that wouldn't became a problem at all... ** CGI in ""Hulk"" is absolutely fantastic!! ** I just don't understand why people say it sucks. It's as good as Episode II's Yoda or The Two Towers' Gollum.

What did you expect from a 50 feet green monster jumping between cities? Realism? C'mon. People are mixing things up. Hulk would never look really REAL, since he has an humanoid form and we are all inclined to compare humanoid forms with the real humans we know. So, the problem isn't in the CGI but in our mind and comparisons patterns. We compare a giant emerald hulk with us, human beings; not how well the CGI was made.

That's exactly why most people think that Jurassic Park's CGI are still the best ever seen and Scooby Doo's are the worst! We have dogs in our houses to compare with Scooby, but we don't have velociraptors as pets. That's why they look so cool. I bet if we had raptors in backyards people would be saying that those from Jurassic Park looks fake...",7.0,27 June 2003

Hulk smash! Ang Lee destroy!,"First off. Better than Spider-man, not as good as Daredevil, on par with X-Men 1 and 2, not a scratch on Batman, a little under Spawn, and crushed by Superman. If you do not like any of the films i have said the Hulk not as good as, then go and see it. If you agree with the films i enjoyed, then go and see Hulk any way.

Good to see that Ang Lee has used the comic book for basis, and not the TV show. Don't get me wrong. I loved the show. But the film needs to be a comic book adaptation. So all you people saying, (IN WHINING VOICE) ""Why is he 12 feet tall?"" keep it shut.

I am not too sure i liked the transitions. Lee draws too much attention to them, thus retracting from the film and withdrawing the fantasy element. If you want people to belive what they see, they need to become one with the world they are viewing. Using silly comic transitions will take away from that.

I think we should have had a bit more Hulk for our money. Despite the fact that i would love to sit and watch Jennifer Connelly play sexy scientist for two hours, it is the big green beast that i have come to see.

Apart from Nick Nolte, most of the acting is very wooden. There is alot, of what i call, porno dialogue. Sentences seem to be written and spoken in a very abnormal way, the actors do not seem comfortable saying them. The scenes become very un-natural. However, saying that, nothing i have seen in ages compares to the famous Banner line said in another language. I actually yelled out in joy, after reading the subtitles. I cannot believe that Ang Lee made us wait until the final moments of the film to hear Banner say it. But it is definately worth the wait. I think he says it in Columbian.

The major problem with this film is that it is a spectical. The CGI, the silly fighter jet scene, the pathetic battle scene at the finale. These are all heavily reliant on the audience being wowed. There is no sense of reason behind them (Obviously, Lee has been watching the Matrix Reloaded too much).

The film is a good attempt at re-inventing a slightly confusing comic book character (what is the Hulk's actual purpose?). However, it falls slightly short and becomes just another Hollywood flopbuster.

Even the effects were unreal and ""fake"" compared with the other Super hero movies.Compare this with any of the x-men movies and you will be horrified...The Hulk charicture was bad enough but...the dogs??...Aw please...Sadly I thought I would try this being a newer movie..But I think I would go back to Bill Bixby and Lou Farregno.

Tries too hard,"In a time when many comic books are getting a big-screen treatment, ""Hulk"" stands out like a sore thumb. It's not exciting like ""Spider-Man,"" it's not as thoughtful as ""X-Men,"" it's not even as entertaining as the average ""Daredevil"" was. It has a distinct style of direction with Ang Lee at the helm, and Lee often uses split-screen camera techniques like comic strips, but the film itself really contains nothing underneath the gloss. It almost makes it seem as if there's something solid under the mess, but basically this film is another B-monster movie with a bigger budget.

The Plot, the crap in between taken away: Scientist Man Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) gets gamma radiation, turns into big monster, military man Sam Elliot (what's he doing in THIS?) doesn't ""understand"" him, so he sends the military to kill him, Hulk fights back, yay, he's a hero, he even saves the girl (Jennifer Connelly) and comes to understand his mad scientist father (Nick Nolte).

In ""Spawn"" a man died and came back as a super-hero. In ""Spider-Man"" a young man got bitten by a radioactive spider and mutated into a super-hero. In ""Daredevil"" a young boy fell into radioactive material and (here comes the surprise) turned into a SUPER-HERO! And in ""X-Men,"" they didn't even bother with an excuse and just stated that in the future there are mutants. I suppose that the mutants in ""X-Men"" are offspring of ""Spider-Man"" and ""Superwoman,"" but I suppose we'll never really know.

Granted, this is taken off of the classic Marvel comic strip ""The Incredible Hulk,"" but the problem is that the film doesn't really try to be anything. The story goes nowhere, and is not nearly as convincing nor attaching as ""Spider-Man"" was. The special effects on the Hulk are ""incredibly"" disappointing; you might as well call this ""Shrek 2."" And after the first half, I found myself leaning back in my seat and not really caring about anything on-screen. It's not a very bad movie, it's not even what one would call ""bad""; the problem is that it just doesn't do anything new, and it doesn't interest the majority of the viewers I have talked to, including myself. No, I didn't talk to myself. Stop taking things so literally.

You can only use the same plot a certain number of times. I loved ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men,"" I even slightly enjoyed ""Daredevil,"" but if I have to sit through one more ""new"" story about super-heroes who gained their powers by coming into contact by either radiactive material or radioactive creatures, I will scream at the top of my lungs and do something stupid. With a film like ""Spider-Man,"" we all know the story and can be forgiving, especially seeing how darn great the movie was. I could give ""Hulk"" a chance with the recycled plot, as it is a classic comic strip that was one of the early radioactive mutant strips. But ""Hulk"" doesn't want to be given a chance; it rips off the audience and deserves its negative criticism.

I won't really criticize Ang Lee (brother of Stan?) nor his filming technique, which in a sense is the definition of ""solid."" It's hard to explain, but the film itself seems to carry a green overtone to it, a dark, grainy, greenish look; the same color of the Hulk. So I assume this is on purpose.

The camera techniques are nice, I enjoyed the comic strip effect the first twenty times, but after a while it gets annoying. Though it is very much like a comic strip, it reminds me more of a ""Boston Strangler"" rip-off than anything new or original.

In the end, I have to ask myself what the HE-double-hockey-sticks Jennifer Connelly is doing in this movie. The young actress who stole the screen in the dazzling fantasy ""Labyrinth"" and won an Oscar for the drama ""A Beautiful Mind"" is doing this movie? Didn't she read the crap script? I guess I can't really blame her: There are so many hit comic book movies often that just about any celebrity will try to get a spot in the Next Big One. Who knows, with rumors of Brad Pitt starring in the second screen-adaptation of ""Captain America,"" and newspaper comic strips like ""Garfield"" getting their turn on the screen, I'm guessing it won't be too far off until we see Tom Cruise playing Dagwood, Snoopy getting his own appearance on celluloid, and Danny De Vito gracing the screen as the Incredible Flying Short Guy (is that even a comic? Who cares). It's not that I have anything against these movies, but if only every one could be a ""Spider-Man""...

"""Hulk"" proves to be what may be one of the most interesting comic to film adaptations yet","***SPOILERS WARNING***

The film opens in the late 1960s with a government scientist working on genetic engineering. The brass don't like him playing God and order him to stop, but he does not. At least he uses himself as the lab rat. Unfortunately, he did this before he had a son, named Bruce, who inherited his manufactured genes.Things go very awry and Bruce ends up orphaned and living with an adoptive family, taking the last name Krensler.

He grows up to become a geneticist researcher in Berkeley, California, where he works in a lab with his ex-love interest Betty Ross whom he still gets along with in a friendly manner.Ross and Krensler have more than work and a near-romance in common, their fathers are both absent. In Betty's case, her military dad, a general was always more interested in work than her.But now they have another problem - the venal, smug entrepreneur Talbot who wants to take Banner's research on making the body self-healing to the military.

Big money in that, after all. Talbot also has eyes for Betty, which does not sit well with Bruce. It all comes to a head when, during an experiment, Bruce nobly jumps in front of a blast of gamma radiation to protect an injured colleague from getting hit. Not only is he alive when he should have turned into bacon, but he's better than before. His injured knee is healing.

It's at this point that a janitor shows up, claiming to be Bruce's father. For the rest of the movie we have the oedipal conflicts interspersed with Hulk battles. At least the fathers have a chance. The Hulk is impervious to pretty much anything. General Ross has this hell bent mission to destroy the Hulk as though it harmed his daughter, when in fact she's the only thing that can control him.

At a time when so many movies are beyond completely and totally brainless, Hulk would seem to be exception. But no, instead we are treated to a film that seems to take it's self very seriously. True, Hulk himself does not appear in the film until 45 minutes into the movie. But those 45 minutes deal with most action movies tend to always ignore: Character development. It deals with, and never but, setting up the rest of the movie with a story and excellent character background.

However, the film has many vaults. For example, I think they took far too many liberties with the comic books, like staying in Hulk form long after he should have calmed down and growing larger and larger as he gets more enraged. It's something that I found hard to ignore, seeing as how I am fan of this character, and many other Marvel characters, and I just hate seeing classic characters being mistreated.

And also, the father issues I love. The reason why I love this movie is that it does have some what of a story, and doesn't try to fool the audience into thinking this movie is a joke. But it could have at least dropped some of the father plot line just to heighten the action and would probably be better for it. It could have cut down just a bit during the first hour and more people would most likely enjoy it.

Personally, it makes me green... duh I mean mad that people rat on this film. People are always complaining that action movies are far too brainless and have no story. When we finally get one, Hulk, people complain that it's too much story induced. Wtf? I guess some people are morons and will never be pleased. It actually makes me mad quite a bit. The vaults that are subjected in the Hulk are many, but for the first time, actually make the film all the more interesting.

This is the kind of film that anamorphic widescreen DVDs were created for as any attempt to pan and scan this thing will result in an unintelligible, visual mess. But like I said, in spite of its many faults, Hulk is one of the more interesting attempts at bringing a comic book character to film. One could even say that those faults make it a more interesting film, one that definitely deserves a look.

***/*****",7.0,14 October 2004
One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"""Hulk"" was, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was missing some very basic elements, which I will recount for you now.

The first thing I notice was the conspicuous absence of a plot. This movie was deathly slow. By the time anything happens, you're so tired of waiting for something to happen that the payoff simply isn't worth it. What happens is this: a guy (Eric Bana as Bruce Banner) becomes the Hulk, and they military doesn't like it, so they fight him. Also, Banner's father (Nick Nolte) shows up for some reason and is revealed to be some sort of weird, crazy guy who is also a doctor, apparently, who also fights him, although we're never entirely sure why (we'll get to him in a minute).

The directing was terrible. Yes, terrible. I've heard criticisms that I just didn't understand the film, but frankly, what's to understand? The director was trying to make a movie that watches like a comic book, which is a mind-numbingly stupid idea. He utilizes split-screen shots to try to emulate comic book panels, overlooking the fact that comic-book panels are a limitation when trying to present action to an audience-- a limitation that thankfully the medium of movies can circumvent. Not this one though. The director, apparently completely unaware that he was doing a movie based on a comic book, tried to be artistic.

The characters were all terrible. I don't blame the actors; the cast was in fact pretty incredible. But the characters were terribly written. No sympathy, no empathy, and no development. Bruce Banner was apparently some sort of personality amputee, although it may be by some birth defect that he was simply born without one. Trying to care about this character was a chore in itself, and detracted from what little there was to enjoy about this movie altogether. Again, I can't blame Bana for this, it was a badly-written character, but I have to say, acting like nothing doesn't really count as acting. Nor is it in any way entertaining to watch. The love-interest, Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) is extremely lukewarm. She's the ingénue, who loves-him-because-she-knows-what's-right, despite the fact that Bruce Banner has all the lovable personality traits of a toilet plunger, but with a tendency to rip the heads off puppies because he gets cut off in traffic. The chemistry between them is bland at best, and quite frankly, someone who looks like Jennifer Connelly could do much better.

By far the worst character was Bruce's estranged father (Nolte) who shows up out of nowhere and rambles incessantly in an irritatingly mumbled voice like some sort of hobo with a Ph.D. . This sort of thing goes on for tedious minutes on end before one stops wondering ""What in the hell is he talking about?"" and begins wondering ""when is this scene going to end?"". Father (for that's his name) also develops an unlikely super-power, which he describes, in typical form, as the ability to ""partake with the essences of things,"" which essentially means he can become stuff. (Admittedly, the visuals here were actually pretty cool. Not cool enough to make up for having to hear him describe it in prolonged bouts of Ivy-League gibberish, though). In the end, Nolte and his son fight for some reason (I think because he's a weird, crazy nut-ball, and Bruce is just a guy who fights people), Nolte partakes with the essence of some lightning and strikes Bruce, and presumably the whole thing is over, except that, for no reason whatsoever, Banner emerges several months later in the amazon, telling some South American drug lords ""you wouldn't like me when I'm angry,"" at which point I actually found myself in throes of agony in the movie theater thinking ""Dear God, he survived, they're setting up a sequel.""

In short, a man who turns into a giant green monster and tears buildings in half when he gets mad should be quite exciting enough to hold my attention for an hour and a half. If you can make tedium out of that, you might want to reconsider what line of work you belong in.",1.0,15 June 2005
"much hyped, overall disappointment","While the cinematography and animation was beautifully done, I came away disappointed. The story left much to be desired and the actors didn't seem to be in synch with each other. Eric Bana was flat, even for Bruce Banner; Sam Elliott & Nick Nolte were caricatures; Jennifer Connelly didn't belong in the movie. I felt as if I was watching a comic book.

"What Dino De Laurentiis did to King Kong, Ang Lee does to the Hulk","I can't believe there are people who like this movie, which fails both as a standard action picture and as a deeper psychological study. It's just bad, with a dumb, poorly structured script. The movie it most reminded me of was the 1976 King Kong, which blew up the tight, simple original into a tedious, pretentious, waterlogged mess. But at least Kong let you see Jessica Lange's breasts for a couple of seconds.

Nolte is fun to watch, Connelly is decent, Bana is forgettable.

The only real notable aspect of the film is the editing. The movie is full of cool tricks, with lots of cool split screen stuff and a couple of interesting morph type things. It's actually really nice, and it's a shame it's not in a better movie.

Awful directing,"I was very disappointed when I finished watching this movie, why? first and main thing that really bothers me is,that the direction of this movie is terrible, the director constantly opens 4, 5 or even more frames of action within the screen at once, you end up seeing nothing, because you don't know where to look at, and the screens are too small, its utterly confusing and also anti-climactic. I assume the director wanted to create a ""comic"" effect or something, but all he achieved was confusion that makes no sense and is not justified at all.

I also had trouble understanding anything that nick nolte said throughout the entire movie, his distorted ultra low voice sounds like an old car running on this movie, or like a dog with a bad case of cough, they should have subtitled his lines. Jennifer connely usually has a good actress rep. but her betty role here was disappointing to me, she is supposed to love Bruce Banner but doesn't act too concerned when the army is using their whole bomb arsenal on him.

the effects of the hulk were good,although the Hulk isn't as unstoppable as I would have liked to see him, but that's alright,anyway, as I said, the visuals are good but there's so many things that make this movie so.. soo... BAD.

the story until the middle or so of the movie is not so bad and pretty much follow's the Hulks original comic story, but after a while, your oh so ""creative"" Hollywood script writers come up with absolutely vomitive ideas that result in something a 4 year old could have written. the ending was really bad, and also, hard to understand what the hell happened there.. it seemed like a totally improvised ""well, we gotta end this somehow"" type ending by those ""talented"" scriptwriters who get payed the big bucks.

Underated,"I do not agree with the general criticisms and opinions on this film. Let's ignore the comic book book, for now.

I am not sure why people ""slam"" this film, so much. It has a great plot, story line and consistent plot development, especially with providing us background of the main character.

With regards to honoring the comic book origin, it does provide some interesting ""camp"" and nods to the ""comic book,"" itself. Character dialogue, interesting comic book scene box titles, and plenty of beautiful colorization, with great effects.

The acting is quite good with a ensemble of gifted actors. Sam Elliot is a superb, ""General Ross."" Nick Nolte, Jennifer Connelly, Josh Lucas, and let's not forget Eric Bana.

The CGI is NOT the problem with this movie...,"... the problem is the director!

Did Ang Lee have to make such an angst ridden movie? I mean come on, I saw Daredevil, it was quite a dark movie at times, even Batman (the orginal one that is!) was a little dark, but this was like watching an essay version of The Hulk.

I mean, was it 40 minutes before the Hulk himself appeared? I knew the CGI was not going to be that realistic, I had heard reviews already from the USA, but it wasn't that bad. I have to say it was like watching a real human being turn into a cartoon, but that really didn't bother me overly.

What really irritated me was how slow the movie was, how many deep and meaningful pauses and drawn out, pained phrases and wounded facial expressions there were.

Eric Bana is a good actor, he could have played this part brilliantly under a different director, in fact, I think the movie would have been much better without Ang Lee, he just isn't a comic-book-hero movie director, it's just not him.

All in all, I would say to anyone who is planning on dishing out some dollars to see this movie:



I saw 3 adults walk out during the performance, which is rare, but I could understand it because they had young children with them who were obviously not enjoying the movie.

Let me finish with one important fact: I have been looking forward to this movie ever since I heard about it being made, and that's quite a long time, and I don't think I have ever been so disappointed.

No wonder the box office so far has not been good, I think it'll be a stretch for this movie to make it's money back at all, except when it goes to rental at home.

Hulk is Incredible!,"The Hulk is one of my favorite superheroes and I was looking forward to this movie. I truly enjoyed it and couldn't wait to see it again. That said though, it does have it's bad points. Ang Lee is a great director but I felt he was the wrong choice for this movie. The main problem with the film is their is to much emphasis on drama and not enough action. In order for a comic book hero to have a terific film, It has to have the same dose of action and drama because if you have too much of one or the other, it doesn't work. That was why Spider-Man(2002) and Superman(1978) were so memorable. I understood what Lee was trying to do with this film and he truly put his heart into it, but still I felt he shouldn't have been the director. Perhaps the worst thing about the movie were the constant split screens, at some points you had as many as four images on with different types of action that you couldn't concentrate on one without missing something else on the others. This type of effect may work on maybe one or two scenes of a movie, but it becomes annoying after a while. However, the best part of the movie is the cast and the CGI Hulk. Eric Bana as Bruce Banner and Jennifer Connelley as Betty Ross were the perfect duo to play the troubled scientist and his love interest. Sam Elliot, who is good as Gen. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross and Nick Nolte,who is a scene stealer as Bruce Banner's mad scientist father David is also unforgettable. Industrial Light and Magic, wich made the CGI Hulk did a good job as well. (Watch the final hour of the movie to see the best part of it.) The Hulk may not be the greatest superhero movie, but it still holds it's own. 8 of 10 stars.",,21 June 2003
A pleasant surprise,"After the laughable trailers I was worried that Ang Lee had made Tim Burton's mistake of not taking his subject with the respect it deserved. I was worried for nothing. Mr. Lee treated this subject as it needed to be treated; not as a comic book but as a monster movie in the tradition of Jekyll and Hyde and King Kong. There are allusions to comic book style, of course (the comic-frame edits got very annoying), but over-all the subject and the characters were treated with dignity. Above all, Mr. Lee resisted the temptation to make the monster appear ""cool."" Instead, the rampaging beast was treated as it should be; the manifestation of the rage felt by an unfortunate young man caught between two powerful, obsessive men. Banner's father seeks to literally consume the offspring he envies; the general sees only a threat to his estranged daughter and wishes to destroy that threat. Bruce Banner, a victim never in control of his own destiny, succumbs to the terrible temptation to free himself from both of them as only a man who's emotional development was arrested at age 4 could; by lashing out. Bruce Banner's relationship with Betty Ross has been compared to a very similar role also played by Jennifer Connelly in A Beautiful Mind; basically as a loyal, highly intelligent and loving partner. There are other lesser elements which distract somewhat and keep the film from being a total success, which is why I voted a 7. Overall, it was worth my $7.25.",7.0,22 June 2003
"Too much plot, not enough Hulk","I love Ang Lee. Brilliant director, incredible visual style, and that style works well here. I even liked the CGI...but the plot left a lot to be desired. It takes 40 minutes into the movie before the green one arrives. Another half-hour before a decent action scene takes place. Too much brooding and under-acting by the two main characters can bore the crap out of you before you get to the payoff of the Hulk running wild. It is also a superhero movie without a villian. If this was Batman, there is no Joker. If this was Spiderman, there is no Green Goblin. There is nobody to root against. You cannot blame the people that are after Hulk...you would be too. I enjoyed the look, but unlike Spiderman and Batman, I cannot see watching this one over and over again.",6.0,20 June 2003
not good,"I was really hoping this would be entertaining. Instead it stunk really badly. Plot was difficult to follow, it was boring as all get out. My wife fell asleep. Bill Bixby is spinning in his grave!

Everyone, particularly Bana, spoke in a dull monotone. Even Sam Elliott, who was so stellar as 'Wade Garret' in Roadhouse, was boring as heck. Eric Bana was as exciting as mayonnaise on wonder bread. Nick Nolte played his Down and Out in Beverly Hills looking character for the umpteenth time.

I loved the TV show growing up and this movie was a real downer. Supposedly, the movie hulk is truer to the comic book, but I'll take the TV hulk.",1.0,5 June 2005

Ang Lee should be arrested for stealing my 8 dollars!!,"I would comment that this film seemed to have been written by a group of 8 year olds.... but if that were the case I am sure that they would concocted a better story line to tie in the random, but visually appealing, action scenes. I loved the CGI Hulk BUT not enough to justify telling anybody to waste 8 dollars to see it on the big screen. The fact that this awfully acted and directed mess of a cinematic comic strip made it to any screen is preposterous. After hearing the glowing reviews from some respected cinema buffs it only serves to justify what I had always expected... that the Ebert-types of the world are getting kick backs from the movie production companies to aid in the theft of your dollars. In a nutshell... rent The Swamp Thing.. although it is a campy, comedic attempt at a super hero, it never claims to be more than that. Hulk, disguises itself as blockbuster and fails miserably. It is true that Ang Lee has taken cinema to points never seen before... unfortunately these points are so low that no one figured they would be witnessed on the big screen.",1.0,26 June 2003

In Ang We Trust,"When I saw the first 'Hulk' trailer over a year ago, and noticed the big names attached to it, I laughed. I couldn't imagine taking a giant green destroyer and making him a character that people could take seriously, or even partially care about. I do enjoy being proven wrong.

Have you seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon? The Ice Storm? Sense and Sensibility? If you enjoyed any of these films, you owe your gratitude to Ang Lee. You can show your appreciation by giving the man the benefit of the doubt.

To many, the 'Hulk' may seem altogether unappealing. Being in those same shoes, I understand completely. But I must ask you non-believers to take a leap of faith.

However, it is not for everyone. Our younger audience looking for non-stop action will be sorely disappointed. This is a character-driven film. There is a lot of meaningful dialogue, and thus, considerably less action than the trailers will lead you to believe. Not interested? Go catch a John Woo film (sorry, John).

If I've managed to convince you thus far, then allow me tell you how awesome this film really is. When the Hulk is angry, he is a force to be reckoned with. You can feel his boundless energy in every frame. It is terrifying. It is everything the destruction of Isengard in 'The Two Towers' should have been (a bit of a tangent--sorry). You will be amazed.

The entirely CGI Hulk is very impressive. There are many shots that are 100% believable; there are some that are less so. But I'm not complaining, and I don't think you will either.

The performances range from very serviceable, to first-rate. Eric Bana has no problem carrying the film. Jennifer Connelly is lovely as always. Nick Nolte was my favorite. The man is amazing, and he fits the role perfectly. Supporting roles--super.

Stylistically is where the 'Hulk' really excels. It is edited like a comic book. Shots flow into one another, composited in many various, interesting manners. Much of the cinematography is to die for.

Enough of my comments. If you have the patience for a skillful mix of character development and action, you owe it to yourself to catch the most remarkable surprise of the summer.",,20 June 2003
A Noble Failure,"It's sad to see so many people lay into ""Hulk"", saying it's dull, confusing and has far too little Hulk in it. While I didn't exactly love the film, I would like to speak in it's defense here. I believe that the relative failure of ""Hulk"" was down to the fact he isn't as iconic or popular a character as Spider-Man, Batman or the X-Men. Also, it is hard to relate to CGI characters and at times I'm sure the audience felt alienated from him. Now, I'll agree that Hulk had to be CG but ILM's effort didn't seem that convincing, especially when compared to the dinos in Jurassic Park or Gollum. Also, the marketing campaign was terrible-all the kiddy tie in merchandise and the Hulk filled clips, making it look like any regular summer movie. So when people sat down and saw it was a physcho dramatic movie about hidden potential and inner demons, I'm sure they shifted uncomfortably. In the age of dumbing down, Hulk seems lost. People seem to complain that the film was ""dumbing up"". I also want to point out the common complaint that Hulk doesn't appear until 40 minutes in. Well, compared to the 58 minutes of ""Superman"" or the 47 minutes of ""Spider-Man"" this is quite speedy (although the fugure on Spidey doesn't include the bit when he is in sweats.) The actual film is indeed flawed, but there is a lot to like-strong performances all round (especially from Bana and Nolte, who ""tantrum"" moment is a highlight.), the effects for the most part are stunning and it continues the tradition of serious, edgy comic movies. Sadly, this movies disappointing performance may make Hollywood nervous about making a sequel or making comic movies serious, meaning that we may go back to more ""Batman and Robin"" level A-Grade trash.

Score-7/10",6.0,5 June 2004
"Hulk Smashes, Crashes!","I was so tempted to go with the cliche, ""It ain't easy being green."" But considering that every newspaper and magazine (including EW) already has done so, I'll throw aside the tripe and get down to business -- this movie was a BIG disappointment.

The beginning moves way too slow and given how much time is spent on dialogue, we're only given caricatures of characters. Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) cries, Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) mopes and General Thunderbolt Ross (Sam Elliott) gets mad -- and they all do it a lot. This is supposed to be a movie about a giant green monster who smashes things, but the action sequences are short and too spread out.

Director Ang Lee basically has tried to making a thinking man's film about an unthinking creature ruled by emotion, most of it rage. The concept just doesn't work.

Also, even though most of Industrial Light and Magic's work in creating the totally CGI Hulk is good and makes a believable creature, some of the effects are sub par. The ending battle sequence between Banner and his father was too dark and I had trouble making out exactly what was going on. The same was true -- though not as bad -- in an earlier fight sequence in the film between the Hulk and some gamma-irradiated dogs.

After reading several articles about the making of the film, I would guess that Industrial Light and Magic and Lee added shadowing to make the Hulk look more realistic and just went overboard.

This wasn't a terrible film, but it's not going to set any box office records. Wait for the DVD.",6.0,20 June 2003
Top Five worst movies,"I went to see the Hulk for two reasons, the first being that I have seen all the other movies out at the moment and second I was bored. I have to say that I am an avid fan of movies and love all kinds. You name the genre I have seen a vast range of movies that will fall into the category, in short I have seen a obscene amount of films. I have to say that his movie is in the top five of all time in my opinion. I hate the fact that I went to see it and contributed to its box office success.

Why did I hate this movie so much well to be completely honest there was not one thing redeeming about it. The story has been done over and over again. The effects would have been better if the film company used a cartoon where the green creature appears instead of the so-called state of the art special effects. The characters were so obnoxious except for Josh Lucas who looks good in suit and plays a good power hungry vilan and Connely whos wasted on such a stupid movie.

The effects were so fake a sixth grader in paintshop could have created a more believable looking hero. Sorry to insult six graders, I meant to say first grader. I thought the effects in the Martix and in Terminator 2 made over 10 years ago were so much better and if at times looked a little fake you could see it wasnt for a lack of effort. The Hulk looked more like Shrek than the comic book character that we know and love. No offence to Shrek.

Nevermind the acting, if we concentrate on the actors themselves. Nick Nolte a word of advice get out of the acting game. Bana don't even think about starting. Nick Nolte is so bad and annoying that I have lost all respect for him as an actor. Bana is the biggest geek I have ever seen in a movie, even worse than Jason Biggs in ""Loser"" and Brendan Fraiser in ""Bedazelled"". I could not stand him. I thought because he is a scientist that he might have that ""feeling sorry for"" oura about him but he comes off as unsimpathtic and does not even change into a cool bad-a** by the end but remains a unsimpathetic geek.

The story can be summed up like this. The animation of the Hulk is a fake and far fetched as the story. In short its crap. Written on the back of a pizza box. Also Hulk is not the only animation in the movie but his dad played Nolte also transforms into this inexplicable ""thing"" influenced by electricity or something, oh and that is also blatantly fake.

Conclusion, do not go see this movie unless you wish to avoid someone, because I guarantee you I they follow into the movie they will leave after 47 seconds due to boredom. It was a total waste of time and the only reason why I didnt walk out was due to the fact that I have never walk out before the end of the film.",1.0,10 July 2003
"Ang Lee's ambitions efforts based on the popular DC Comic book series are often masterfully executed, yet fails to bring toughness and excitement critical to this genre.","Even with all the muscle and rage, potentially explosive `Hulk' is an unsatisfying action film experience. At first, it seemed like an odd choice for a character sensitive director like Ang Lee but considering his genre-breaking resume, the producers were hoping to breath art into action. As it turns out, Ang Lee's ambitions efforts based on the popular DC Comic book series are often masterfully executed, yet fails to bring toughness and excitement critical to this genre. Nick Nolte's tyranny and Jennifer Connelly's aching stare are effective as the tormented father and compassionate girlfriend, Betty Ross, respectively. Eric Bana's Bruce Banner and Sam Elliot's military man Ross are serviceable but too often get eclipsed by their counter parts. Danny Elfman, a veteran scorer of blockbuster movies, provides the film with energy often lacking in the film.

`Hulk' aims to remain faithful to the original material and to connect emotionally but come at a price of tensions either being subdued or indirect, critical for an action arena where the experience is more visceral than emotional. Making a good action film that rock is as difficult as a good art film that transcend. Still, it is welcoming to see Hollywood trying to do something different and this one rates 7/10.",7.0,23 June 2003
Not the worst marvel movie I've seen,"I actually quite enjoyed this movie, obviously the special effects weren't the best but they probably were at the time. I liked the story line and it had a great cast. The one thing I didn't quite like was the colour they chose for Hulk I reckon they should've gone with a darker tone. This certainly isn't the worst marvel movie in my opinion that position goes to Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance but it's not the best either. I do like the 2008s MCU movie The incredible Hulk a bit better but my favourite portrayer would have to be Mark Ruffalo In the Avengers films. Overall this is a really good family film and quite enjoyable to watch and if you like marvel or superhero films just give it a try",5.0,28 January 2021
Enjoyable film with impressive special effects but low on the re-watchability factor,"Yup, it's yet another comic-strip superhero adaptation and for me personally, this film takes me back to my childhood. The Incredible Hulk' was a famous television series when I was a child and was one of my brother's favourite programmes. Unfortunately, he rarely got to watch the show in peace as the sound of the theme tune alone was enough to send me into floods of tears. Even now, I can still vividly remember the transformation which was the source of my trauma: the bloodshot eyes and bulging green flesh becoming visible under the ripped material of Bruce Banner's shirt ..

Director Ang Lee succeeds in capturing a comic strip feel in the film. Often the action is split-screen and the way that the camera switches between scenes mimics the way someone would scan the images when reading a comic.

On the whole, the cast is good: Jennifer Connelly as Bruce Banner's ex-girlfriend is effectively tearful when necessary and Nick Nolte is disturbingly tramp-like and manic as the elderly David Banner. The special effects are also very good; the Hulk is an impressive creation but as a result of being completely computer generated, he is not as scary as in the television version. What does come across in the film is the Hulk's awesome invincibility with his ability to smash up buildings; defeat mutant dogs and spin tanks around his head with ease (the violence is perhaps too much for young children).

Unfortunately, I feel that the story telling does not really justify the need for the film to be over two hours in length. Not much time is really spent on providing the background of the hero and as a result, you don't really get to know the main character and cannot sympathise with him. In a speedy introduction, we learn that genetic scientist Dr David Banner has passed his self-mutilated genes on to his son Bruce through using himself as a guinea-pig for his genetic modification experiments. Like his father, Bruce grows up to become a genetic scientist. Following an incident in the lab which causes Bruce to be exposed to a dose of gamma rays, he transforms into the Hulk' in moments of stress or anger. Other than that, there really is not much else other than the military finding out about this monster and seeking to capture and destroy him. The film is also let down by a chaotic and silly ending and of course, like in the television series, you are still left wondering how Bruce's pants stay intact during his transformation!

Overall, I did enjoy Hulk' but unlike some other comic book adaptations I've seen, this is not a film I would choose to watch again.",7.0,23 July 2003
Could have been MUCH better,"More focus on the past and how he became the Hulk and less focus on the plot to create the ULTIMATE human! The movie leaves you to guess on the exact circumstances surrounding Bruce's conception and eventual adaption into the Hulk. We see flashbacks but there is no real background information about what is going on! What was the purpose of Professor Banner's laboratory studies? Why was it so radical that he would use human samples for his studies? Why did Betty's father hate Professor Banner so much? At least that part is evident! Not to mention, what was the purpose of Professor Banner destroying the lab? The only purpose of the laboratory explosion, in the comics, was so that Bruce could become the Hulk. But since he was born the Hulk, there really was no need for the explosion at all! This movie leaves a lot of questions to be asked! That is why I give it a 5!",5.0,1 May 2006
Incredible...,This is the best movie released by Marvel so far.

The Hulk: A deeply confused movie.,"If I could describe The Hulk in one word, it would be confused. Everything about this movie is either confused or confusing, and you may get confused as to why the movie is so confused. Now, don't get me wrong, there are many good qualities about this movie. The acting, the action and the visual effects are all excellent. There are ambitions about this movie that are very brave and daring. But they all seem inferior when you look at the movie as a whole, because in that perspective, it just does not all hang together. The movie is confused about what it wants to be, where it wants to go, where it wants to begin, where it wants to end, when it wants to start, and when it wants to stop. It's confused about how fast or slow it should go. It's confused about what to emphasize and what to downplay. And the most annoying confusion is how many comic-bookish transitions and split-screens it should use, because there are waayyy too many. It gets pretty irritating after a while. Even in the most inappropriate scenes for these transitions and split-screens, there they are. And there are many moments when the movie seems to be building to something high, but then wimps out. Almost everything about this movie is indecided and lost, and thus the movie really suffers. There were actions and decisions made about the movie and scenes included that had my mind boggled as to why they happened, or why they were there. Some of the experience of watching this movie was frustrating and trying, rather than thrilling or moving. Sure, some scenes are thrilling and some scenes are moving, but it just doesn't help the fact that the movie is deeply confused. Maybe it's because Ang Lee was confused when he directed this. After all, I'd probably be a little confused if I were an acclaimed director stepping into a comic book flick. All I know is when the DVD comes out, I want to watch this movie with director's commentary on. I have many questions about the movie, but somehow I doubt there are very good answers. And that in a nutshell is my big problem with this movie.

I give this movie a 7/10. I'm torn as to whether this score is too low or too high, but this is the way I think I feel about this movie for now. But what I do know for certain is that it falls way behind comic book movies like X2 and Spider-Man, and this movie, more often than not, is lost and confused. But it's worth seeing once, I guess, if you're curious.",7.0,22 June 2003

My best film of the year so far,"First of all, I love comics and nearly every popular comic-book character Marvel put out. Following the success of movies like Spiderman and X-Men, a screen adaptation of The Hulk seemed inevetable. In my opinion, it was even better than Spiderman, and considering that The Hulk is probably the most difficult character to actually make a film about, the filmmakers have outdone themselves here.

The movie really is amazing. I've never seen a comic-book adaptation that really captures the feel of a comic-book so well as in this movie. People may think this is yet another addition to the current Marvel superhero craze a la Daredevil, but you really have nothing to fear as the film is helmed by highly acclaimed director Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and has a totally different feel compared to it's Marvel predessecors. Just be prepared for the frenetic pace of the film.

The movie is very dark. There is quite a lot of violence and there are several scenes that may scare the hell out of little children. Eric Bana is sure to blow up after this. He suits the role of Bruce Banner extraordinarily in this movie. The supporting players, such as Jennifer Connely and Sam Elliot, are all strong and faithful to the characters, but are overshadowed by a creepy and mysterious Nick Nolte as David Banner. The last hour or so of the movie is absolutely terrific, and literally had me glued to my seat.

This is a type of movie that, had it been made twenty years ago, would just not be realistic or gripping enough. But with modern technology, the hulk is a completely computer generated character and looks exactly as in the comics. The CGI and visual effects in the movie were breathtaking and some of the best I've ever seen on screen.

In conclusion, The Hulk is on par with The Matrix Reloaded as my favourite film of the year so far, and I advise everyone to go see it to see just how a movie on a comic-book character should be made. Forget any doubts you have about seeing this movie, The Hulk is the blockbuster of the year. I give The Hulk 10/10.",,28 June 2003
Um...... the sequel was good.,"Don't get me wrong for saying this,but this isn't a bad movie nor an excellent masterpiece.Instead,it's more of an OK movie that's has some value,but not a lot of it.So I recommend that you watch the sequel instead.But since I'm talking about this movie,I going to cut to the chase. This movie tells us about Bruce Banner and his past,especially when his father went psycho and killed Bruce's mom.Many years later,Bruce gets into an experiment that accidentally unleashes the powerful brute inside him.That's the plot and that pretty much sums up the entire movie.So like I said,this is a watchable movie with some decent special effects,but I recommend the sequel,which has more story and more action.Basically,this movie is a solid C plus.

Hulk:C+

Flawed but interesting,"Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" is without a doubt the most bizarre big-screen comic-book adaptation I have ever seen. It's a bizarre dichotomy of comic visuals and arthouse drama, with a couple of big action sequences thrown in to appease those viewers who were expecting a summer blockbuster.

""Hulk"" is not about a large green monster smashing things, although it has that too. It's about how parents mess up their children and then deal with it in all the wrong ways later in life. Bruce Banner is an emotionally dead ticking time bomb thanks to his evil father's genetic meddling, while his recently-ex-girlfriend Betty is completely estranged from her career-military father due to his lack of involvement in her life. When the Hulk himself finally comes along, we realize he's not Banner's rage - he's ALL the psychological baggage his father left him with.

Fittingly enough, the two show-stealing performances here come from Nick Nolte and Sam Elliott as the two fathers whose sins are at the core of the film. As it stands, ""Hulk"" is not the best movie around, but it's an interesting one, and I prefer a unique film that makes me think to a more consistently paced one that doesn't. It's a fine piece of unexpectedly cerebral melodrama - but it's far too thoughtful to be a successful action movie.",7.0,7 November 2003

The only problem: not enough chemistry between Bana and Connelly. The scenes between them that should have resonated with deep feeling - the actual emotional core of the film - somewhat missed the mark because I didn't feel the two characters actually had a connection. Still well-worth seeing, for the plot involving the two fathers (Nolte as one of them) and the overall high-mindedness of the venture.",6.0,23 June 2003
Very bad indeed,"This movie looks all right at first as we see the huge big guy with creepy eyes staring at us (the audience) but, when comparing the television version with this, well, too bad that the TV's version is much more better. First, the creature at the movie was original and from human transformation. Secondly, the tune/music/theme are so sentimental/touching it gives us the feeling that this is a tragedy.

Now, the movie version has more action on it. How can a guy can be that big and that green and that funny. It(His) face expression in the movie is very ridiculous and funny. He(It) looks Fat!

"HULK: One that is large, clumsy, or awkward (Webster's dictionary)","That's exactly what this movie is. Large, in that it is well over 2 hours long and probably cost a fortune to make. Clumsy, in that no one wants to see a movie that turns into a cartoon whenever the main character is on screen. And last but not least, awkward, in that similar more successful movies, such as ""Spiderman"", have proved that live action is what makes a comic book hero come to life on the big screen. If a man could be transformed into a ""Predator"" or an ""Alien"" over 20 years ago, surely todays make-up artists can turn one into the ""Hulk"" in 2003. What were the producers thinking? I can't believe that Stan Lee allowed the makers of the ""Hulk"" to turn what could and should have been a cinematic breakthrough into a second rate misfire. A fine cast is totally wasted in this convoluted mess. Eric Bana was excellent as Bruce Banner. Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte were also feasible in supporting roles, but the whole concept of transforming from a man into a cartoon character is totally unforgivable in a time when modern technology (CGI for example) allows us to accomplish almost anything on the big screen.",6.0,19 January 2007

Most underrated superhero movie,"I watched Hulk recently on TV, and was just reminded of how good it is compared to ALL other movies, not just comic adaptations. Especially since it is not your usual superhero story with a boy who gets superpowers and gets to fight crime, bla bla bla...

The best of the movie for me are the facial expressions of Hulk - they are done so well here with the CG that I am starting to believe they hired the real Hulk, filmed him and then added some shaders to give it a CG feel :D But seriously though, the story is really moving, and Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly and Nick Nolte really pull the movie in the right direction.

So if you are reading this ""review"", go watch it, you won't regret it no matter your taste of movies.

Mixed reaction,"I have very mixed feeling after having seen the Hulk. As background, I have never read the comics, but watched the TV show as a kid.

One thing that is definite is that the movie payed tribute to its comicbook heritage. A lot of editing (split frames) reflected this. To me it was more of a distraction, especially the first time it happened. Some people might like it though.

Also the origins of the hulk were different than I remembered from the TV show and what I know of the comic book. I suppose that is inevitable because the Hulk originated in the 60's and not in modern day, but sticklers will not like it.

There were a few fight scenes in the movie that were incredible. I won't give away all of the opponents, but one of them is the military as featured heavily in the trailers. My only objection to these is that the Hulk appeared a bit too cartoony. Not comic book, but cartoon, as if the Hulk were covered in a rubber suit.

Overall I did enjoy the movie, and would give it 7/10",7.0,20 June 2003

A love or hate film?,"When I saw the film, two of my friends decided to watch Charlie's Angels 2 instead. So I watched it alone. And what an experience it was for me. The first half of the film, with the flashbacks and unique visual style absorbed me so much that I ended up watching it again the next day. It's a beautifully written story about CHARACTERS, with flaws and back story and broken pasts. I loved the quiet scenes and interactions so much that I found the action getting in the way sometimes. And then there's the music. If ever I was delightfully surprised by a music from a film, this would be it. Danny Elfman really delivers something so different and involving. Quiet moments before the big battle, the emotion filled dialogue companions, and the sense of coming of storm in the main theme. Why do some people hate it I can never understand. When they say it's boring I can understand, what with the newer MTV style editing like Charlie's Angels and Fast and the Furious.. but how can people say that it's badly written and acted.. that's just beyond me. I mean, what standard do they judge it by? So in the end, I can say that it's a love or hate film. I for one, LOVE it. I can only hope that in the future I will find more films that pleasantly surprises me like this.

not as bad as the trailers made it seem...very comic-book style,"Contrary to the impression I got from the trailers for this movie, it was actually pretty good. Which is not surprising considering Ang Lee directed it, and he is a master of evocative character development. The animated-Hulk took a bit of getting used to on the trailers, but in the movie, the viewer gets gradually adjusted to the transformation. Also, Lee does a good job of playing up the ""kitschy"" comic-book feel of the movie, so you feel like you are watching a liquid version of a paper comic book. Quite interesting, actually. Best of all, though, Lee does a good job of showing character development, which many comic-book movies don't always do. I enjoyed it.",7.0,2 August 2003

"Achieved their goals, but that wasn't enough","Though I was thoroughly disappointed in this movie, Ang Lee and company did accomplish what they set out to do. Instead of a film adaptation of a comic book, they tried to make an actual comic book on screen. The editing, cinematography, etc. were very cool in that sense, because it was quite literally like watching a live-action comic book.

That is about all that I found interesting. The acting, delivered by some very talented folks, was very flat and unconvincing. The plot and villains were uninteresting. The CGI, though well done, was just so sensationalized that it seemed ridiculous. It's worth watching, but definitely isn't on my ""must-have"" DVD list.

They promised us a good movie and look what we get a freaking reject. One thing thats good about it is nothing. I am so glad that they are making a whole new hulk movie with a new cast. At least they're not retards, old hags or low budget actors.",1.0,29 August 2007
HULK SMASH!!,"I love super heroes, so of course I had to see 'The Hulk' opening day.

I wasn't disappointed. Unlike other recent Marvel movies (Spider-man, X2). The Hulk is strongly character driven. Bruce Banner doesn't even transform into 'The Hulk' for the first 45 minutes. Once the action begins though, it comes hard and fast and very very cool. I was beginning to wonder if I had wasted 8 dollars until the first major fight scene began. From there, the movie goes from one jaw dropping action sequence to the next (with small breaks to develop the story, of course). Ang Lee's use of split screening to give a comic book feel was 'cool', but distracting. I was impressed by what it must have taken to do it, yet it jarred me out of the story by reminding me I was watching a movie.

The Hulk's story line is dark and sometimes a little scary (too scary for young children).

Another high budget super hero film, not the best but not the worst either.

"The Moose Hole - ""Hulk Mad! Hulk Smash!!"" Wish I could!","Almost every boy can remember reading a Marvel comic book at some point in their childhood reading in astonishment about the amazing adventures of world's most favorite superheroes. One always wishes that they could see those feats in real life. Well now, in a way, we can. A recent trend of adapting comic book heroes to the big screen has taken Hollywood by storm. Starting with the success of films like Blade and X-Men, this trend expanded rapidly with the huge success of Columbia's Spider-Man, which grossed $400 million domestically and broke most box office records. Now every studio wanted to get into the act as each new superhero film seemed to out do the last one. Even films based on lesser known characters, like Daredevil, were met with success. The general opinion of the American public seemed to be that they were willing to rush out to the theaters if the studios were willing to pump out more of these amazing comic book adaptations that brought boyhood dreams to life. The most recent example of this theory is the $210 million domestic gross of X2: X-Men United and the critical acceptance of the film as well. But sooner or later, one has to admit, the dream can only go so far. Whether we liked it or not, the American public will receive a superhero film that does not live up to their expectations. The only question is what film will that be? Universal hopes that it is not their adaptation of the big green behemoth, The Hulk. With a $135 million budget and several rewrites on the troubled, Ang Lee hopes that his version of The Hulk will continue the superhero trend but will all that hard work end in failure for the promising director?

The story goes that Bruce Banner is just a normal man like everyone else. He was adopted as a young child and has no remembrance of his past life as a young child. But nothing really seemed to set him out from the crowd outside of the fact that he was very quiet and always bottled up his emotions preventing him from feeling any real connection to anybody. That may be the reason why he and fellow scientist Betty Ross recently ended their relationship together. But the end of this relationship is just the beginning of the troubles for Bruce Banner. The father he never knew comes back after Bruce has a freak accident in a lab experiment involving radiation. He reveals to Bruce that he is unique and that the world will never accept him for what he is. Bruce still fails to understand what he is but that doesn't last for too long. Every time Bruce feels emotional anger within, he looses control and becomes The Incredible Hulk. Bruce must learn to control his emotions before he is eliminated by the army. The story for The Hulk is mediocre at best but what can one do when there isn't much story around The Hulk to begin with. Sure there is the story of his origin but outside of that it is just basically, `Hulk get mad! Hulk smash!' Ang Lee tries his best but those attempts end in failure. There is no consistency with the story as it is either too slow or too fast in some parts of the film.

The cast of The Hulk tries its best to make due with what is given to them and some cast members work better then others. New comer Eric Bana, who stars in WB's summer 2004 tent pole, Troy, is actually quite good as the human form of Bruce Banner. His look, which is quite similar to Orlando Bloom, seems just right and the way he tries to control his emotions makes the character all the more sympathetic. Bana is probably the best member of the entire cast as he plays his character to perfection. Jennifer Connelly, fresh from her Academy Award winning role in A Beautiful Mind, is moderate as Bruce's love interest, Betty Ross. She tries her best to bring some emotion out of the character but there really anything that strikes a cord with the audience. The problem is that she is crying in every other scene. There is suppose to be connection between her character and Bana's but there just isn't one that we can clearly see but that is not all her problem. Rather it is the problem of the story. Nick Nolte is great as Bruce's father, David Banner. The only problem with his character is that he seems to just disappear for moments of the film and then reappear. There is no clear distinction on what the purpose of his character is. Is he really just a misunderstood loving father or a power hungry psychopath? No clear answer is given. Josh Luca's character, Glenn Talbot, seems just pointlessly placed in the film. What does his character have against Bruce that makes him attempt to kill him in his home? A highlight within the beginning of the film was the cameo of Stan Lee, the creator of The Hulk and Spider-Man, as a security guard. It is nice to see him appear in each of the films based on his famous comic characters.

Overall, The Hulk tries so hard to prove itself a success that it just ends in dismal failure. There are so many problems with this film that they can't all be named at one time. The comic book styling of the film with split screens and cuts and wipes was just ridiculous. One does not go to a film adaptation of a comic book character expecting a comic style to it. If one wanted something like that then you could just pick up a comic book and read. A film adaptation is expected to bring a comic book to life rather then just incorporate the comic into film. The story is also a big problem. Either the actions are going too slowly or too fast. There is no sense consistency at all for the film. Many questions are also left unanswered. Why did Bruce's father not kill Bruce? He killed his wife but only accidentally. He had the opportunity, why not take it? His father is sent away for 30 years but how does he escape and get back to Bruce? How is he able to work at the lab, even just as a janitor, without them knowing where he is? And what is the deal with him at the end? How is Bruce able to change back from being The Hulk to being normal Bruce? Nothing is cleared up correctly for the audience to clearly understand what is going on. Based on the issue of the special effects, the CGI is moderate. The Hulk seems pretty realistic at night and when he is slightly hidden in shadows but looks absolutely ridiculous in the desert and in broad daylight. The chase scenes are nothing more then an attempt to show off the CGI Hulk. Those scenes do nothing but make the story go around in circles. One doesn't see a problem with a giant green monster flying through the air? Ang Lee is a great director with his work on Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but The Hulk is just a huge mess from beginning to end. Guess not all comic books characters are meant to be brought to the big screen.",3.0,20 June 2003
Sigh... Phenomenal!,"Well I found this movie deeply satisfying - it actually brought a tear to my eye, can you believe that?? ;-) ... Maybe I just hit the right movie on the right day. Warning to those who expect a ""normal"" movie about super-heroes, this is something more refined, I think. The patient approach to the outburst that provoke B. Banner into his initial mutation is phenomenal. A story of energy accumulated and exploding - a story of metamorphosis and dark sides... I think it takes about 45 min before we finally witness the Hulk coming to reality, but by then the pressure is intense! This one just hit me right in the eye - I hope it'll do the same for you. Although this would not be the best movie I've ever seen, it has been one of the most satisfying movie-experiences of my adult life.",10.0,2 May 2005
"Adequately entertaining, nothing more","Ang Lee tries hard to make the film good, but his efforts to inject substance and art to the project are misguided. Why couldn't he have just tried to make it fun? Last year's Spider-Man fulfilled a lot of that promise. The Hulk (or Hulk  imdb provides the `The,' which isn't in the main title of the film or on any of the posters) does entertain when action strikes. There are at least three great action sequences, although a couple of them take place at night, making them difficult to comprehend at times. The finale is especially muddled, and I could only barely tell what happened. But I had to love the Hulk  literal id. I want the sequel to be Bruce Banner-less. The rest of the movie is better than it ought to be, with particularly good performances from Jennifer Connelly (who seems to think she is vying for her next Oscar) and Nick Nolte (who is the only one who seems to know exactly which movie he's in). Director Lee tries to present the movie as a living comic book. It doesn't come off too badly, but this has been done better before in the animated television series The Maxx. 7/10.",7.0,20 June 2003
Too much pump!,,3.0,26 October 2003
"I set my sights low, but they were exceeded beyond my wildest expectations ...","Admittedly, I set my sights very low for this film. Of course, after Matrix Reloaded crashed all my hopes of it being a perfect science fiction trilogy, I was extremely cautious about Hulk. After all the advertising had innundated every billboard; the merchandise was everywhere in stores. So I had low hopes for Hulk. I was expecting a Daredevil. Maybe, at best, a Spiderman. but hulk shot way past both of those, into classic film history, for me. First, allow my to tip my non-existant hat to Ang Lee. I know now that I should have trusted in his directing to begin with. The way this film was presented - the multiple frames - brought home SO much that this was not a film based upon the shoddy TV series; or the godawful film; but indeed a film based on the Marvel comics. True, it got a little tedious at times, with needles frames showing two angles of the same instance; but in other cases, it brought home the cmoic element of the film. Eric Bana. Here is a talented actor. I had not seen any of his serious roles - not Black Hawk Down nor Chopper - I had ony seen him in Full Front as Plastic Hair Ray Martin and ""Poiter"", so I didn't know what to expect. Yet again, I was amazed. Eric Bana brought to life that character of Bruce Banner, and also of Hulk. He made it believable that this geeky scientist posessed a rage so terrible; he ahd the prescene about him that indicated that he could snap at any minute. No one else, I think, could have made this role so believable - as no-one has the dark intensity; the slight cold streak; the uncontrollable edge - to be able to realistically and fittingly play Bruce or The Hulk. ILM. Well, the CGI surprised me. The close up shots of the Hulk were fanastic; brilliant. As were the transformations. The distance shots still left much to be desired; but it was still a dramatic improvement on anything they've done on anything else yet. Overall, I was absolutely thrilled by the Hulk; and I can't understand why it got so many disappointing reviews. Perhaps it is because the average twenty-something, action-craving cinema goer would have balked at the slow pace of this film; and been agitated by the character build up and personalisation of the character of Bruce Banner and his backstory. But I think those who were displeased with this film missed something great; they missed a truly groundbreaking film, with a lot of heart, and gutwrenching emotional impact. They also missed the pioneering of a new genre of film; a new style of filmmaking. There have been comic based films so far, yes; but this is what I would call an on-screen comic. It is a breakthrough; and it is what I think will make Hulk stand the test of time, and become another classic breakthrough in film, such as Bladerunner. It will certainly outlast other action-packed on-screen comic adaptations such as Daredevil, and probably even Spiderman. Hulk, I think, like it's subject, it a film of raw power and emotion.",,28 June 2003
"Hulk hurt by studio, Hulk mad!","The Hulk was both a giant on the screen and in the media, hyped up beyond belief during the 2-3 weeks prior to release. One could not escape from The Hulk's fury. Now, granted I was excited about Hulk but I preferred to let my own expectations guide myself into the theatre and not some magazine cover so I didn't let the hype get to me. I enjoyed watching the teaser and year prior and the Superbowl adbut that was about it, (I like to get a small taste to get my mind going). But I felt the hype went overboard, granted it wasn't as bad as Godzilla's was, (then again, Godzilla was much worse that Hulk was) but it does suffer from the same problem: hype killed the monster.

Hulk suffers from two problems: pacing and style of direction with both mutating and causing mayhem much like the Hulk does. I have nothing against Ang Lee and respect him as a director but his style just doesn't work with this film. The multiple screen view, (where there are multiple frames on the screen each showing the same scene at different angles) works for shows like 24 but not on the big screen. The comic book drawings and designs are not need and just look ridiculous, (Bruce Banner turning into a cartoon when hit by gamma rays? Come on!). As for the pacing problems, I think there needed to be a good blend of action and plot without cramming it all into one section. The 90-minute plot at the beginning is a real drag for what Universal expected to be a summer film, while the 45 minutes of action at the end was rewarding but too shortthen there's the ending which really came out of nowhere. Basically what I am trying to say is that this was supposed to be a summer film, judging from what the studio hyped yet it clearly was not that.

But Hulk is not all bad; I walked out of the theatre feeling my money was well spent. The CGI was mighty impressive, (regardless of what anyone thinks) and really showed the green guy well. The acting was up to par while the action was mind-blowing, (I still like seeing Hulk smashing up those tanks in the desert, doesn't get old). But the pacing again was the real problem as I felt the action should have been more present with the plot doing it's job of holding the film together while not being an artificial brace.

So, why did Hulk turn back into a disappointing summer movie after being an unstoppable monster? Hulk is such a great concept; it has the character development and the action to make a great film. Hype and a flawed direction ruined its chances to become the next X-Men and provide another franchise to the superhero genre. Even though Hulk was riddled with flaws it provided an entertaining two hours, which I felt, were well spent.

1-1/2 STAR DISASTER,"This is the worst Marvel Comics film adaptation thus far. The character of Bruce Banner is now a creation of his deranged father, and was basically a monster when he was born. This destroys the entire concept of the character. Eric Bana is a total bore in a badly-written role. Is there any reason to give a darn about Banner with this new origin? Any compelling reason to follow him in a sequel? No. The much-talked-about split screens add nothing to the film since there is nothing even remotely complex enough going on to take advantage of split-screen techniques, and become tiresome after the first few minutes. The Hulk looks ridiculous not because he looks fake--so did King Kong--no, he looks ridiculous because his face looks like a fat pouting version of Eric Bana. Hulk fighting three Hulk dogs? Hulk fighting his crazy father who inexplicably turns into a confusing version of the Absorbing Man, finally becoming some kind of energy cloud? What the heck is this film, anyway? Who in the heck decided to make a film called ""The Hulk"" and then create something that includes both a goofy green monster jumping around the desert AND a flashback with a crazed father stabbing a mother as the young boy looks on? Just who did they think they were making this film for? The answer is...no one. It's a total bore with embarrassingly bad dialogue, no plot to speak of, flat performances, a couple of fun Hulk moments that are over way too soon, and a totally ludicrous third act supervillain. Hey guys, this was supposed to be a superhero monster movie, not a bogus repressed-memories melodrama. Ang Lee was the wrong director for this material, but the real culprit is the producer and writer. Shame on you, Schamus.",1.0,20 June 2003
An interesting adaptation,"Hulk is not like your usual comic book adaptation. It's a movie directed by Ang Lee, which means it's a movie based on a comic, but it's the work of a director who will try to find something different, in the material, from your normal genre movie. And he does find it. Hulk is a variation of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.Hyde, the story of a meek, controlled man, Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) who is victim of not one, but two experiments that go wrong (one that happened before he was even conceived, thanks to his father's obsession, and one that happens to him as he's working on a genetic research in a university facility), and witnesses a transformation in himself. When the rage and anger in a situation becomes too strong, a primal force is unleashed in him, something powerful and primordial. He turns into a giant creature, wild and with a strength that's almost infinite. Hulk. One of the good things of the movie, is that Hulk is not good or bad. It has no real moral connotations. It's in a way nature, the wilderness, the roots of man. But it is still Bruce Banner, in a way, in love with a fellow scientist, Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). Hulk of course attracts the attention of the military, who wants to study it, see if it is fit to be used as a weapon, and if not destroy it. One of the very interesting things in Hulk, and something that separates him from other movies of the same genre, is that there are no real bad guys, until the third act, and when the villains do appear and reveal themselves, in the story as such, well they got pretty complex motivation. General Ross (Sam Elliott), Betty's father, who takes charge of the military operations regarding Hulk, is not seen as a bad guy. he's also a pretty complex character. He knows more of the story than he lets on to his daughter, but he's someone who's trying to deal sincerely at the best of his abilities, and within his limits and flaws, with an extreme situation. There are beautiful things in Hulk (like Ang Lee's use of the split screen in the beginning, which is totally at the service of the actors), but also things that don't work. One of them, and a pretty big one, is the creature himself. It's a total CGI work, it looks like it, and it's hard to buy him as a true being, made of flesh and bones. You accept it, but you're not convince by it. But, if even with this special effects limitations, Hulk remains an interesting, fascinating movie, and it does, well that's just further proof that this unusual big budget comic book film has really something good going on in its core.",7.0,7 December 2005
I Wouldn't Want to Make You Mad...BUT,"The Renaissance or rebirth of action comic heroes to the silver screen of late has been a very welcomed change by this viewer. Having not read comic books as a child, I did grow up with the comic book culture: the television shows, animation shows, toys and figurines, posters, etc... of such dignitaries as Spiderman, the Hulk, the X-Men, Batman, Superman, etc... This being said, I was very familiar with the story of Bruce Banner aka the Incredible Hulk. What I was not prepared for when I sat down to watch Ang Lee's Hulk was a film almost entirely devoid of the elements that made me enjoy the Hulk when I was younger. True, Lee might have been much more truthful to the legend of the Hulk than anything I had been previously exposed to, but I don't buy that completely. Lee made a muddle of a film that has some solid moments, but when the final tally is taken Hulk is nothing more than one long, boring film laden with nothing more than repetitive CGI effects that create no sense of reality nor offer the viewer to have any real feelings for the characters involved. We don not even see the Hulk for the first 45-50 minutes of the film! What do we see? Not much. Some story-board comic book style scene editing that I am sure Lee thought was revolutionary but instead was aggravating. Eric Bana, Jennifer Conneley, Sam Elliot(been awhile since I've seen ham cut this thickly in awhile), and Nick Nolte, who by the way looks and acts like he just woke up on the street and was escorted to a soup kitchen, talk about things I am not quite sure they understand. I understand what Lee was trying to do. I just don't think he came anywhere to success in offering that theme in an entertaining film. For me Hulk was a major disappointment and an excrutiating time to see. The best part of the whole film for me was the last line of the film. It showed that a more tongue-in-cheek approach might have broadened the appeal of the film such as you see in X-Men and Spiderman. I might sound a little too harsh with this film. It does have some good things going for it: the acting is pretty decent from the principal leads, many of the effects are breath-taking, and Lee's direction at times shows brilliance. The biggest problem with this film is comparing the end result with what could have been done with it. Ay, there's the rub!",3.0,29 December 2003

"Worth seeing, but may lack longevity",,7.0,24 June 2003
"Bad screenplay deprives ""Hulk"" of any emotional punch","I've never been a big fan of the character The Hulk. He's not a typical superhero in that instead of being a human who has some cool new ability and utilizes it for moral objectives, he's a man with a genetic defect that turns him into a lumbering green giant with a knack for destroying things. But a love of Marvel superhero movies kept me rather open-minded for this one, and indeed, watching this film, Bruce Banner/The Hulk seems like a protagonist with a compelling story to tell about fighting one's inner demons. However, the way this story is told, ""Hulk"" completely fails to fully utilize what makes The Hulk a unique character in the Marvel universe.

In short, ""Hulk"" is a botched attempt at an origin story. So get off Ang Lee's back if you think this is bad and tear up the three-man team that wrote this mediocre script for him to work with. While Lee does give a poor depiction of the Hulk that is more gentle giant than mean green killing machine, that's the least of this film's problems. James Schamus (story) and his crew don't create a story that really gets at Bruce Banner's dilemma or even lets us access Bruce's psyche. He feels distant for a protagonist and the connection between Bruce and the Hulk is not smooth. Eric Bana as Banner didn't help. The nerd element of Banner doesn't come across and while I find Bana talented, he was too serious and plain in this film and his emotions came across that way too. Bottom line, I felt little to no pity for him, which is unacceptable in a film of this nature.

The dialogue of the script is also pretty subpar, except for Nick Nolte's lines as David Banner, the wackjob scientist that screwed up his son. The lines are a bit direct because they carry too much of the load for moving the plot forward. The beginning, Bruce's suppressed childhood memories, a mystery that sort of unfolds with time, is particularly choppy and the connection between Bruce and the viewer never really gets established. We see no more than flashes really of his past and he goes from a 4 year old to a college student in about 2 minutes. I guess the movie needed to be longer, but it would have been worth it to make us actually care about Bruce. I'm not surprised that Schamus and Co. haven't been behind any of Marvel's highly touted films since then, only the mediocre or worse ones: Fantastic Four, Punisher. In fact, Schamus never got another stint with Marvel. I guess co-writing ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" doesn't guarantee success in the world of superheroes.

The next beef to have with the film is the action. Fault both Lee and the writers here. To say there isn't enough is justifiable, but at the same time, I'll take a film with less action if it's giving me some great character drama, which ""Hulk"" obviously doesn't, so the lack of action hurts the film here. The action scenes are brief and Lee simply doesn't mess enough stuff up. The Hulk doesn't really get beat up or end up completely destroying something out of sheer rage. The dog fight scene fits the plot but is tasteless and the rest is kind of anti- climactic. For being in a state of blind rage, Lee doesn't give us a Hulk that is sloppy and destructive. In fact his blue eyes (when they're not green) make him a bit effeminate in ways. (Side note: Bana has brown eyes, way to go)

I'll give Lee and the editors credit for the paneling technique used to portray a comic book feel. At times it really makes the movie different and neat, though its use feels rather arbitrary and sometimes pointless. At the beginning it works well but as it gets used more and more it doesn't work as well. I also give credit to Nolte and Connelly as Banner's love interest Betty Ross. Connelly pulls off the soft, sensitive vibe. At least someone cares about Bruce. Lastly, kudos to Danny Elfman as always. I'm a big fan of the vibe the score gives off for this film.

This is not one of Marvel's bright spots. They brought in the wrong people for this film and ultimately as much as I could pick it apart, there is just no personality to this film and no emotional connection. The whole film is straight-faced, confusing and forgettable. No surprise 5 years later the franchise is already being reinvented.",4.0,11 June 2008
The hulk...no...the bulk (of crap),,,21 August 2006
Entertaining film with good story,"The best thing about ""Hulk"" is not the special effects but the story behind all of it. The story is about a scientist named Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) who doesn't remember his parents but in flashback sequences we see that his father worked with DNA for the government and injected himself with an experimental drug and later he gets his wife pregnant so the effects of the drug are passed on to his baby boy. Banner works with a woman named Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) and they were almost lovers at one time but he has always remained distant. Betty's father is General Ross (Sam Elliott) and he is responsible for getting Bruces father locked up for 30 years and Betty has maintained a distant relationship with her father. One day an accident occurs in the lab and Bruce is exposed to gamma rays and this activates the drug that he was born with in his system. One night a man shows up (Nick Nolte) and he announces that he is Bruce's father. Bruce has been harboring repressed emotions all his life and his anger finally unleashes the Hulk. The film is directed by Ang Lee who is known for thought provoking dramas and he aims the focus of the film in the right direction with the characters repressed thoughts and emotions. Its interesting that both Bruce and Betty have bad relationships with their parents so we can believe that they have a common bond. Nolte gives the best performance in the film as the brilliant but psychotic scientist who doesn't think twice about using his own son as a guinea pig for his experiments. His performance gives the film just the right amount of pathos to make this more than just an action film. There is real depth to his ravaged eyes and features. The Hulk itself is where the film is in real question. The shots of him at night or in close-ups are where he is most effective looking but when he is running about and battling the military than the film loses some conviction. It is fun to watch, don't think I wasn't entertained. But these scenes are just not convincing and it shows that we still have a long way to go with computer graphics as special effects. At times during the film I thought I was watching an animated feature! For you trivia fans the creator of Hulk Stan Lee and actor Lou Ferrigno appear as security guards. I did enjoy Hulk but its far from convincing. Remember how convincing the dinosaurs were in ""Jurassic Park""? This is nowhere near that. As far as comic books turned into films is concerned the best is still Superman 1 and 2, Batman 1 and 2, Spiderman and probably the first X-men film. This would fall right behind those and its clearly better than misfires like ""The Phantom"" and ""Daredevil"" and ""The Shadow"". The focus of the story with the characters and Nolte's performance are the best things about the film but even with unconvincing graphics this is still a lot of fun to watch.",7.0,29 June 2003
Not the best superhero film.,"It must be hard to write decent movie about probably the stupidest comic book hero ever created. Let's face it: Hulk ain't the most intelligent creature to have long, meaningful dialog with.

So, what they dried to do, was to bring out the internal suffering of Bruce Banner (Eric Bana), as he tries to struggle against the monster within. Other actors? Well, everyone was just so typical. Hard to pick anyone specific from there. Nick Nolte had nice role. Probably the best in whole movie as Bruce's father, who was responsible of Bruce's double identity. Jennifer Connoly was pretty in her role as Betty Ross, Bruce's, and Hulk's, object of desire.

I must confess, I've never been a fan of Hulk comics. I didn't hate them either, I just didn't care about the character. Green, muscular idiots rarely appeal to me. SO I didn't wait much from this movie either. And usually, when you approach something from that point of view you wont be disappointed badly. But in this case it's really hard to think much to say of this film.

Well first, Ang Lee tried, I mean he really tried to make a comic book movie. I mean literally. He used divided screen all the time. Action of the movie was very comic book like. I felt I was watching animated comic instead of a movie. That made it real hard to take this flick seriously, even tough it did try. But it failed, tough in some places it was very fitting. Maybe it would been better, if they'd just made this a animation film. Dunno.

And second, the special effects. Well, they worked in some places, but sadly it was far too obvious, that Hulk was fully computer generated character. He just looked so fake and out of placed in many scenes.

I'd say it was worth 5 out of 10.",5.0,10 March 2005
I am looking forward to the Edward Norton version.,"I am great-great fan of Marvel Universe and always very much look forward to any remakes of any stories related.

This is a totally, deeply, completely, profoundly forgettable and unlucky specimen. Even the Fantastic Four has been better, and I consider this an insult.

Eric Bana is miscast, to say at the least, and the rest of the crew is forgettable. The effects are not bad (they managed to get Hulk green and big, wow), but nothing you will tell your grandchildren stories of. I don't think Ang Lee got the point of the Hulk-story.

The Incredible Sulk!,"This is an embarrassment to one of Marvel's best superheroes and it makes it seem that 'it's not easy being green' especially considering that the film didn't bring much green at the box office.

For a film that has the word HULK in the title, it's very unfortunate that the film's name is totally out of place considering the story is basically a slow-paced and Hulk-lite story.

As a fan of the Hulk character, this film didn't really want to focus on its title character; instead it wants to be Bruce Banner, a sooky and whiny insult to the character's alter-ego.

For 2003 it's technically impressive and well-done multi-million dollar filmmaking, but today it's a bad egg that has collective nostalgia for some, but others not so much. I'm amongst the not-so-much crowd in that regard.",3.0,19 September 2017

The incredible  Freud?,"I think that 'Hulk' suffers from the same problem as some other recent sci-fi films, like 'The Core'. Instead of accepting that these kind of stories is all about fantasy & giving the audience a fun thrill ride, they try like maniacs to anchor them in reality & waste half the time on excessive talking & presenting ""plausible"" scientific explanations. Anybody with knowledge about this genre knows that such mumbo jumbo never makes the audience connect more, it totally works against its purpose. So it's a mystery to me that movie makers who are able to spend millions of dollars on their productions continually fail to understand basic facts about good screen writing.

In 'Hulk' the back story is presented very quick in the beginning, which I thought was good, but unfortunately this does not lead into a fun & fast paced action movie. Instead it almost comes to a full stop for about 40 minutes that is filled with romantic nonsense & lots of psychobabble. And when the action finally starts to unfold the development is still very slow, and it's only in the last half hour this really feels like a movie about the incredible Hulk. So once again we see that Freud, real world science & comic book characters don't mix well. Sorry Ang Lee, watch 'Blade II' & better luck next time.",4.0,6 November 2007
"A great, big, steaming pile of green . . .","Aside from the CGI Hulk, who looks about as good as the current technology will allow, there is absolutely NOTHING REDEEMABLE about this film. Ang Lee, in a misguided attempt to re-create the ""look"" of a comic book, divides the screen into panels (think picture-in-picture T.V. set). What he does not seem to realize is that comic books do not expect one to look at the entire page at once, but rather to go from picture to picture. At times Lee has in upwards of 5 boxes on screen simultaneously, each with a moving picture within. The result is a dizzying, nausea-fest. Add to this mix a penchant for odd zooms and transitions and you are left with a sense of vertigo akin to staring into a hypno-disc for several hours. Unfortunately, feeling ill is about the only feeling you will experience while viewing the film, both as a viewer and from the actors themselves. Script-wise,there are several attempts throughout the story to elevate the film to the level of classic Greek tragedy, but only a simpleton would be impressed with the hackneyed writing of this movie.",,21 January 2004
Different superhero film,"The film attempts to be serious, but there are some weird beats here. The dog ambush and that anticlimactic finale weren't the ideal choice for a film already struggling with pacing. Hollywood has struggled with The Hulk, even the Marvel adaptation failed to maintain an audience. This film had an interesting intention with the editing design and the acting is quite okay. It's the connections to the comic book world that drags this film down. This is not the film fans deserved and Ang Lee wasn't the correct filmmaker. He is a gifted filmmaker, but not everyone is suited to the genre. More of an indie film, not a mass marketed action film. This would make for an interesting character focused sci fi drama film, not the summer blockbuster. A film made for no one essentially, and that's the shame.",5.0,2 December 2019

Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly (Betty Ross) have no chemistry and sometimes do not even convince me that the characters are human. The film sometimes makes strange visual choices that would be comical if they were not so tragic and apart from a duel cameo from Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno, this film has little to offer other then senseless Smashing.

Stunningly dull,"I've never felt more ripped off in my life than with this film. I've been waiting for a Hulk film since I was a kid. Well, I'm still waiting. The first hour of this film focuses (and I use that term loosely) on a lot of scientists scribbling in notebooks, wringing their hands and saying ""it can't be!"" Sorry, but it can, I think. There are dozens of flashbacks of people having flashbacks of a flashback that happened to them during an earlier flashback; ie more flashbacks than a Grateful Dead reunion could possibly provide. We have Nick Nolte, once a capable actor, now looking fished out of the nearest alcoholic sewer, doing lots of hand wringing, scribbling, and whispering (""it can't be!).

Looking for the HULK...? I was, I waited and waited and waited and waited.....children ran screaming up and down the aisles, parents chatted on cell phones, others dozed. I finally took to standing up to stay awake during this snooze fest film. Surely they wouldn't make an entire Hulk film without a Hulk...? I dunno. After about 90 minutes I left, regretting I wasted my time, money and energy. Whatever Ang Lee is doing, it has nothing to do with entertainment.",,30 December 2003
Ang Lee should stick to Chinese melodramas,"What was Ang Lee doing in this project? He just ruined everything. Similar to ""Crouching tiger.."" where there was no energy in the supposedly artistic fights just a meaningless melodrama, 'Hulk' is irritating, made by someone who thought that making comic-book-page shots is a good idea.

The CGI effects are laughable. Worst than 'Spider-Man' and these were pretty bad. I mean they only had to create the monster and make it look real. Have they seen the creature in 'Two Towers'? The technology is here, it's just that they didn't utilize it.

Ang Lee go back to your melodramas and leave action movies to people who care about them.

Hulk smash!,"This film is a very mixed bag and I remember seeing at the cinema at the time it came out. It has got solid acting, pretty good special effects for 2003, a great soundtrack, and some stunning visuals. The problem comes mostly with the story. I admit that the movie earned my respect by focusing more on characters than the Hulk, but I wish it did more. There isn't a whole lot of development between the Hulk and Bruce Banner, one of the things that I really like seeing in Hulk movies. It would have mad it a lot more interesting, but unfortunately the movie bloats the runtime with a generic father-son dynamic that doesn't really pay off emotionally.

Eric Bana and Jennifer Connally having very little chemistry with one another. Sometimes the acting is a little stiff, besides Nick Nolte. He comes off as a little out of place in the film, his extremely energetic and intense acting doesnt mix that well with the more stoic and reserved acting by the rest of the cast.

The editing in the film is also quite odd, Ang decided to go for a more comic book panel style. It doesn't work tremendously well except for a few scenes, and it distracts the viewer from what they should be focusing on. The film would be a lot better without it.

The villians in the movie aren't very compelling, and seem very out of place. The final battle is a CGI smackdown although its much more about the relationship and emotions of these two characters

Speaking of the action, it can come across as lackluster. The Hulk doesn't look bad, but he doesn't seem like the rage monster he is in the comics. He's built like a giant toddler, and his face isn't that intimidating. The action is mostly Hulk fighting the military. Its shot pretty well, and its entertaining enough. The best fight was definitely the last though, having some beautiful cinematography and that awesome score by Danny Elfman. Overall, I'd say check it out if your a fan of the Hulk. It may not be your cup of tea, but I'd say for the average competent viewer, it'll be worth your while.",5.0,15 April 2021
A Good Idea Sent Astray,"My, how opinions change. I have seen a host of movies multiple (multiple=at least three) times. For many, such as ""For Your Eyes Only,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" and many movie comedies and ""Seinfeld"" television episodes, I ask myself, ""Why am I not enjoying this the way I did before?"" In those cases, I realize that my view of the movie has not changed. For some reason, be it familiarity or lack of novelty, I simply don't have as good of a time seeing them. The quality of the movie has no bearing on my feelings. That is not the case with ""Hulk."" When I saw it in 2003, I enjoyed it so much that I put it on my Christmas list. When I saw it again recently, I asked myself that question once again. There is no innocent explanation this time. My fogged glasses have been wiped clean. ""Hulk"" is a bad movie.

The most serious problem is director Ang Lee. He just couldn't keep his meddling hands off a wildly successful format that did not need updating or improvement. Tom Desanto, David Hayter and Brian Singer (writers and director of X-Men); and Sam Raimi and David Koepp (Spider-Man) understood both the quality of the material they were adapting and the desires of its fans. Lee and writers James Schamus, Michael France and John Turman either lacked that understanding or believed their vision would be superior to one that captivated readers for forty years. Imagine if Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman had radically altered James Bond in 1962. The series would never have gained wings, and some of my favorite movies would have never been made.

Ever since the Hulk first appeared in May 1962, coincidentally one year before ""Dr. No"" opened in the United States, one of the center points was Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) possessing powers he does not want. He considered them a curse. In the comics, he gained his Hulkdom via an accident, not the sins of his wicked father, David (Nick Nolte). By making the David Banner storyline the axis the movie rotates about, Lee sucks out all life. Tragedy or not, Lee was dealing with a comic book, and even the saddest must have a sense of fun. Bana noted that the on set atmosphere was ""ridiculously serious and morbid."" The inclusion of the father is a titanic mistake.

Just who is the villain anyway? General Thunderbolt Ross (Sam Elliot)? Ross may work against Banner, but he is not evil. ""You have my word I'll make sure he's cared for,"" he tells his daughter Betty (Jennifer Connelly) after placing Banner under house arrest. Note the words ""cared for,"" not ""dealt with."" ""You can trust me to do what I think is right,"" he declares later. He allows Betty to try helping Bruce. Buried under the calcified exterior and explosive temper resides concern for Banner's well being. He realizes that Banner's best interests are the same as Betty's and his own. His antagonism does not come from hatred, but fear: fear for Betty, for himself and for public safety.

Is it Glenn Talbot (Josh Lucas)? He is puny. His pupils may as well be in the shape of dollar signs. Only greed motivates him, he is never a threat to Banner, and he lacks the resources of Ross and powers of a Marvel supervillain.

Is it David Banner? Nolte is absent for too many long stretches. The movie is inconsistent with how he regards his son. Sometimes he weeps for him, at others he wants to kill him. There is a twist when David does something very stupid, but his motives are unclear. If I call his character development moronic, then I should receive a tax deduction for being charitable.

The two action scenes receive a split decision.

The first is a fight between Hulk and three mutant dogs. The magnitude of this poor decision defies words. I understand it comes from a comic issue, but that is no excuse. Imagine how audiences would respond if Spider-Man had defeated Sandman with a vacuum cleaner? That happened in one issue. The public would laugh in mockery if Columbia announced Kangaroo and Jack O'Lantern, the latter of whom uses a pogo stick, as the super-bad-guys for ""Spider-Man 4."" Just look up the villain roster on wikipedia and see how many come back from the dead or have four different people as the same character. Just because it is amusing in comic books does not make it acceptable material.

A twenty-two minute chase involving Hulk running from tanks, helicopters and fighter jets provides the second. It probably swallowed half of the 137 million dollar budget, and it looks and sounds impressive. What follows does not.

During Michael Apted's director commentary for ""The World is Not Enough,"" he stated that after Renard died, he needed to exit the movie quickly. Instead of doing so, ""Hulk"" wastes time on a pointless father and son meeting where David Banner screams nonsense like a psychotic who drank twenty Red Bulls. I can never again enjoy a Nolte performance.

My problem is not that it is too cerebral, an accusation levied at the action fan by many professional critics. To paraphrase ESPN radio host Colin Cowherd, I don't root for any focus of a movie any more than a chef roots for a pork chop. I just want it to be a good pork chop. Lee sent this movie in the wrong direction. From start to finish, it is a bad meal.",4.0,16 July 2008

"""Angry Man is unsecure.""","What a disappointment this one was. Back when it came out, I was one of the first in line to see it. My brother and I were Hulk fans from way back. We thought this would be the chance for the Hulk to shine on the big screen. Who knew that, instead of a fun comic book movie, we'd get a gloomy oddity about some guy with daddy issues?

Eric Bana apparently studied acting in a lumberyard. Jennifer Connelly gives another of her expectedly depressing turns. These two as leads hurt the movie more than anything. They soak up the somber tone of the script and drip melancholy for two hours. Sam Elliott and Nick Nolte give the best performances. In Nolte's case, however, his character is part of the film's many problems. The origin story is overcomplicated and it would have been better served without Nolte's character in it. He's a weak ""villain"" and his climactic battle with the Hulk is confusing and unsatisfying.

On the plus side, Danny Elfman's score is very good. The special effects are better than their reputation suggests. Hulk has been referred to as looking like Shrek. The only time this is sort of true are in the close-ups. Why Ang Lee did so many close-ups of that obviously cartoon face I'll never know. The scenes of the Hulk destroying things and fighting the military are among the film's few exciting moments. What the hell was with the dogs? Dumb. Just dumb.

The gimmick of using ""comic book style"" split-screens is distracting and doesn't fit the super serious tone of the movie. But if you ever wanted to know what it would look like if Brian De Palma directed the Hulk, I guess this is a good indicator. The movie's watchable but its somber tone and lack of fun do it in. I can't help but feel that if this exact same film were directed by a nobody instead of Ang Lee, its number of defenders would drop from few to zero.",5.0,2 June 2014

Puny human.,"I remember seeing the teaser for this when I saw Spiderman (2002). I was excited, bc I always enjoyed the made for tv incredible hulk movies with Bixby/Ferrigno when I was growing up (that's all I knew about it at that point). Then I went to see it,, and I was very disappointed 😞. After seeing Spiderman in the theater I had such high expectations for this one,, and at first viewing it just fell flat!

I have now watched it at least 2 more times, and my opinion has slightly changed. It's ok in the sense of an alternate universe version of the hulk,, but that's it. The Incredible Hulk (after Ironman) movie is imo the definitive origin movie of the Incredible Hulk. So good!

At least we get to see Jennifer Connelly throughout the entire movie.

I don't know enough about the comics to know which name he went by, but in the tv series/movies the Hulk was David Banner, and in this one the Hulk is Bruce Banner (David being his father). David Banner is a military scientist who is working on mutating genes and experiments on himself, which he the passes on to Bruce when his wife becomes pregnant with him. Nick Nolte plays the crazed maniacal scientist pretty well (or maybe he was juat being himself?) Elliott plays Thunderbolt Ross very well.

If I had to say why this movie didn't work for me it was the direction, the comic book like screne shots, the bad cgi, and Bana as Banner. Bana is by no means a bad actor in any way,, but just like Brandon Routh as Superman, Bana just didn't work that great in this one. Maybe it was the script, director, etc etc,, idk,, but it just didn't work. I'd give it a 5.8 rating overall.",5.0,5 June 2022

Its unnecessary long with pointless scenes and the ""comics style"" transitions just make even more pointless. The script has a lot of plot conveniences, and the Hulk growing as he gets more angry is stupid.

The first time I watched this as a Hulk fan a really hatted this film, but the second time watching just as a movie, it actually seems even worse.

"Crouching Hulk, Hidden Nolte","Now that Marvel films are some of the greatest money-makers on the planet, it feels good to reflect upon a time when they spewed out movies that weren't up to par. Remember the Fantastic 4 films? How about ""Daredevil"" and ""Elektra""? And don't even get me started on the Ghost Rider films. Thankfully, with the introduction of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, bad comic book movies are kept to a minimum. But I personally think the film that started Marvel's downward spiral was ""Hulk"".

Notorious art-house director Ang Lee is the film's field general and you could definitely smell his pretentious stench upon the first couple minutes of film. Most critics argue that his style brings out the philosophy of the character and helps explore deep psychological aspects that most comic book filmmakers haven't touched upon. In reality, his brand of cinema doesn't mesh at all with the comic book movie formula at the time of the film's release. Audiences were used to seeing over-the-top, wisecracking superheroes grace the screen. Ang Lee wanted to try something different, but I'm afraid he bit off more than he could chew. It wasn't until a few years later when Christopher Nolan directed The Dark Knight trilogy, which showed audiences worldwide how to successfully create a comic book movie with dark and philosophical themes.

First off, the look of the film is exasperating. Lee throws in a menagerie of weird Malick-like visuals to create symbolism, but it only confuses the audience. The comic book motif was cute at first but got annoying real quick. Audiences are quite aware that they are watching a movie based on a comic book. Seeing four poorly-executed shots at once should be classified as ""sensory overload"". And while the overall cinematography wasn't all that bad, there are instances where the shots and editing are just plain awful (shots being flipped for no reason, shots fading to black for no reason, ugly scene transitions, etc). The effects are laughable, to say the least. Back in the day, the Hulk looked like the real deal. Twelve years pass and now he looks like a bad PlayStation character. The Hulk Dogs were even worse. They looked like computer-generated Scooby-Doo dogs from Hell. The editors and special effects crew definitely wanted to try some new tricks out, but some of the scenes look like they were made with filters in Microsoft Movie Maker. To think this film was released ten years after ""Jurassic Park""- one of the most groundbreaking films regarding special effects. Alas, the tacky effects are only one part of this hulk-sized atrocity.

The acting is more wooden than a Louisville Slugger- and Eric Bana is the ringleader. We know Bana tries his darnedest to give us a performance for the ages, but he always falls flat. In ""Hulk"", he's either softly speaking in a dull, monotone American accent or yelling gibberish. The audience is supposed to empathize with his character, but after countless confusing scenes, we simply can't. I had tremendous high hopes for Jennifer Connelly- who was amazing in Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"", which was released two years prior. Sadly, she falls under Ang Lee's spell and becomes just as wooden as Bana. Most scenes with her character are drab and lack emotion. She is constantly starry-eyed and weeps over everything. Sam Elliot is Sam Elliot, plain and simple. Josh Lucas' character was surprisingly forgettable. But what really threw me off was Nick Nolte as Bruce Banner's father. Nolte used to be a revered actor, but now he's reduced himself to mugshots and box office bombs. When Nolte's character is in a conversation with someone, he is quite dull and dry. However, when he is yelling or something intense is happening, Nolte goes over the top. No one actor in the film can find a balance between too little acting and overacting.

In the end, it's best to look back on Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" with a very open mind. Most fans of the film are fans of Ang Lee's previous works, such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". This could be why fans and viewers are turned off by the film- Ang Lee's cinematic style simply doesn't fit in a comic book movie. Comic book fans and myself alike want a Hulk film to be about the monster destroying everything in sight. Sadly, it isn't this movie. As ambitious as it was, ""Hulk"" sadly didn't deliver. The combination of pretentious direction, scrambled editing, dated special effects, and rigid acting is sure to leave a bad taste in anyone's mouth. But if you're feeling adventurous and want to explore Marvel's not-so treasured cinematic past, I'd say 'go for it'.",1.0,20 May 2015
A singular experience,"I thought I had seen the worst years ago with Beneath the Planet of the Apes and Last House On The Left, but I was wrong. The rating system here doesn't go low enough for this ""film"". I was wondering throughout the movie if they knew that this was a comic book character. Still don't think they did. The plot is completely disjointed and almost impossible to follow. The characters have virtually no development or consistency. The CGI is awful. The sound levels go from zero to warp and back again for seemingly no story related reason. It is more than 2 hours long but the title character doesn't show up until nearly 45 stultifyingly god-awful minutes into the movie.

I loved this movie. I was enraptured from the beginning till the end. I've watched it several times on cable and I own it. I can't understand who wouldn't like it, except for people who expect the Fast and the Furious, and get the Ice Storm instead. Sorry there weren't enough explosions for people.

A Slow Start for the Green Goliath That Ends Up A Winner!,,,22 June 2003
Slow and dull,"The Hulk (and Bruce Banner) in general is relatively a boring and uninteresting character. And in this film, Eric Bana doesn't portray a great Banner/Hulk as he isn't likable and comes across more as selfish and confused. The overall story of this film is lacking any interest.

Many origin stories (about how the character become their superheros) aren't always fresh and they take long for the story to come together. The CGI isn't too great either but it's passable.

Another thing which felt forced about this movie is the constant camera cuts, and camera side angles/side swipes effects that tried making it more like a comic book feel. This was very much overused and didn't add much to anything at all.

The film as a whole was overly long, dull and at many times boring and predictable. The romance love angle between Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly wasn't convincing either.

There wasn't much of a villain here with its plot containing in most part how to get the Hulk to get back to his normal Bruce Banner self. Unlikable leads, slow action, boring predictable storyline and a lengthy runtime create for a disaster of superhero movie.",2.0,3 May 2019

Disappointing!,"When I was a kid I was a huge fan of the comics, and naturally I had to see this film - and I was disappointed. The effects are many, but far from all looks good. The Hulk monster itself looks somewhat animated or whatever is wrong - it does NOT look natural (meaning ofcourse as natural as a real Hulk WOULD look). There is a lot of history behind the monster in this film, and I like that, but it ends with a very confusing ending....and I still miss a LOT of elements from the comic books..",,29 June 2003
"An absolute pile of garbage, perhaps the worst superhero of all time","It's 2021. Ang Lee's Hulk has not aged well. The CGI is ghastly and looks so horrendous it's laughable. I understand that technology was not as advanced as it is now, but come on! Look at the Hulk jumping around in the desert. He looks so goofy running around and jumping. And let's talk about the editing please. The editing is JARRING. We didn't need the part with him as a kid, we could have gotten to that later. All of that was completely unnecessary. The way some people appear in little boxes that SLIDE FOR SOME REASON while another box appears for another character. My god, it looks so tacky and terrible. I would definitely say watch this for laughs. But on the other hand it's soooo boring! Nothing happens the whole movie.

This was 2003 and we did not know how to make superhero movies. We tried something and wow did it not work.

"What Constitutes A "" Bad "" Film ?","With art everything is subjective . How many times for example have you seen a pop song top the charts that you can't stand ? Conversely you can have a musical artist on your ipod that's always playing that most other people have little knowledge of . It's the same with cinema . Something like TITANIC breaks all sorts of box office records and scoops eleven Oscars but no one I know has a good word to say about it . And because it made so much money and scooped so many awards it's difficult to say it is a bad movie . We can only be subjective in saying it' painfully over rated

One criteria you can perhaps judge a movie on being "" bad"" is to watch the box office placing . If a film hits the box office top ten chart at say number two then a week later it falls several places this indicates that it's driven by marketing hype and audience word of mouth has neutralized the marketing and no one wants to watch it . May I predict this might be the case with THE HOBBIT ? There might be another aspect to judge a film and it goes something like this ....

One time I was at a university film class and the film we were discussing was HULK by Ang Lee . Nobody had a good word for it . One person claimed it was literally too much of a comic book with the panels being utterly distracting . One person claimed the characters were under developed while another claimed it was far too talkative to hold their interest . My criticism of HULK was none of the above but the opinion that the CGI was dreadful and that no time when Eric Bana turned in to the Hulk I was taken out of the movie since I couldn't believe that the Hulk existed in the same dimension as the live action - it was merely something that was created on a computer that resembled a cartoon

This is a great pity because I could see that Lee was trying to make a film that was a little bit different from the mainstream but has failed to a degree . That said it's not a terrible film . It stayed in the US box office for four weeks and was the 14th highest grossing in America in 2003 so using my own criteria it's probably only a slightly mediocre film",5.0,3 December 2012
From several aspects...,"On the one hand, ""Hulk"" is a big, loud mess; but on the other hand, it's somewhat interesting due to Bruce Banner's (Eric Bana) inner conflicts: he doesn't really like becoming the big green guy, but at the same time likes the feeling of power. The most eye-opening aspect, at least for me, was how they did the scenes like in graphic novels.

I guess the thing that's most surprising for us is who all worked on this movie: there's the director of ""Brokeback Mountain"", the star of ""Munich"", the woman from ""A Beautiful Mind"", plus Sam Elliott and Nick Nolte. Considering that the material involves a lot of thrashing and destruction, I guess that everyone's doing as good a job as possible. One of my friends remembers when they closed the Golden Gate Bridge to film a scene. All in all, not the greatest superhero movie, but not awful.",5.0,11 March 2006
Underrated work of art,"This film demonstrates the danger that lies in making a film which does not conform to expectations of the genre. The criticisms of it were unjustified and ludicrous in equal measure. It is a beautifully crafted and highly creative piece of film making. Ang Lee really tried to make something like a moving comic book, and not some childish comic but more like the kind of adult scripted graphic novels of Frank Miller. At times it was really breathtaking how the animated and CGI effects became a kind of moving artwork. I also thought the characterization and story were way beyond what you might expect from such material, really quite credible and moving. A brilliant piece of work that was just too innovative for the simple minded viewers and snobbish uptight reviewers who trashed it.",9.0,26 June 2013

A comic brought to life - slow building action,"I saw the movie The Hulk today, Ang Lee's grand interpretation of a comic book classic and huge fan favorate. My immediate response to this film is ""holy crap, it was like reading a comic book, only on film.....very wierd and immensely entertaining"". Watching each scene is like flipping through the pages of a good comic, with amazing transitions that make the surreal intricities of ""Fight Club"" look amatuer.

Now onto the film. I won't bore you with an exhaustive plot outline, nor a quick narration - I'm sure that almost everyone is famailar with the basic principles of the Hulk story. I'll instead narrate my personal experience and give a breif critique of the cast:

Jennifer Connelly was good as usual - no real complaints with her acting job. One scene in general with her bugged me however: being attacked by huge mutant dogs while being protected by your boyfriend that suddenly appeared as a huge green monster would usually put you under a great deal of duress. During the entire scene Connelly appears perfectly serene. Eric Bana's work as Bruce Banner really won him some respect from me. I was skeptical of his abilities coming into the film, but was relieved by his excellent work. Nick Nolte, as Bruce Banner's father, was terrific. Classic skulking Nolte highlighted by a rather dramatic flashback concerning the demis of his wife - I almost forgot that Nolte could actually act, and act very well. Sam Elliot as Ross, Connelly's father, couldn't have been casted better. The rest of the cast was really inconsequential. Nonetheless, Lee spent so much time character building that having only four main characters doesn't hinder the film at all.

The first 30-40 minutes is very slow paced, filled with vintage Ang Lee character building, foreshadowing, and drama. Fans looking for a pure action film will be dissapointed with the first half of the movie. Hulk fans will appreciate the time that Ang Lee takes to identify the huge disparity between the calm of Bruce Banner and the relentless fury of the unleashed Hulk. Regardless of personal taste, it will be hard for many movie goers to discount how impressively Lee brings to life a breathing, fluid comic. I still find it hard to explain, it's difficult to convey with words what the experience is like - you really have to see it for yourself. A suprising cameo by Lou Ferrigno (the actor that portrayed the Hulk in the television series) and Stan Lee (creator of every worthwhile Marvel comic ever, including the X-Men, Spiderman, Daredevil, and the Silver Surfer) had everyone laughing.

The initial ""release"" of the Hulk was ominous and creepy. The packed house (every seat was filled) collectively gasped at the scary transformation and insuing blitzkrieg of destruction. Each transformation is similar, highlighted perfectly with moments of calm and reflection that Hulk fans will instantly recognize: a brief moment of calm amid the flurry, the quiet distraction of a desert flower, the slow exhale before another rush of rage engulfs the Hulk. Did I mention that Ang Lee completely brought to life the Hulk character? You can tell that this guy was a major fan.

Anyways, the second half of the film is highlighted by amazing action scenes that serve the film very well. Watchers that were becoming bored with the movie during the first half will be happy that they decided to wait it out. A fight scene between the Hulk and three mutant canines was about as visually impressive as the sword battle between Li Mu Bai and Xiou Long/Jen Yu in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The fight concludes with a brutal release of rage by the Hulk that many small children really shouldn't see (he basically tears his last opponent to pieces). The Hulk's escape from a secret underground military facility in the middle of the desert (vintage comic book material) was a hillarious and over-the-top action sequence highlighted by the death of his main adversary - a demise which is captured in perfect comic fashion - another scene that is hard to convey with words (I can tell you that the entire audience was laughing and clapping though). It ends after an amazing scene involving the Golden Gate Bridge, a F-18, and space. Fucking wicked.

The build up to the finale is arguably drawn out, but again, I think that you will be pleased with the outcome. I won't go too much into detail, but the Hulk's arch enemy The Absorbing Man leads him through a battle that is quite simply the most visually amazing fight scene that I have even seen. Yes, even better then ""The Burly Brawl"" between Neo and a hundred Smiths in The Matrix: Reloaded. If you watch the movie after reading this review, tell me, wasn't the ""lightning scene"" genious?

From the computer graphic scenes and the interaction with the special effects crew, to the music used in the soundtrack. Ang Lee personally looked at every little particular aspect of the movie. Also in the special effects he tried to obtain a REALISTIC rendering (dust, sweat, breaths) and I think that he reached his aim. I'm disappointed in having seen a low average in the votes.

Underrated masterpiece.,"I don't call something an underrated masterpiece lightly. That's a bold claim, but I feel like this is necessary. Compared to the light and fluffy depiction of Banner and the big guy in the MCU these days, and especially compared to the safe, generic, boring Edward Norton flick, this movie is a deep and intimate journey through the breaking dam of latent rage.

Ang Lee is one of my favorite action directors of all time. This movie is sharp, lucid, cognitive... everything in it builds to an effect. The bold split screen effects are more than just comic book emulation, they are confusion and discomfort of an overload of information. The editing in this movie is deliberately crafted to make viewers angry... which was a huge risk that didn't really pay off, because resisting it makes you uncomfortable and it's not really an aesthetically pleasing thing to behold without the effect. But surrender to it, and you really find yourself in Bruce Banner's head... lapses in imagery and real-time continuity, jumbles of information and incoherent panic. The cinematography is perfect and unlike anything else.

The saddest thing about this film is Betty Brant's reaction to the monster, and Bruce Banner's dependence on her reaction. And that's really what this movie is about. Can Betty accept the rage and trust in something so wildly unpredictable? Logic versus heart. And Bruce is just lost within it. It's a sad story of helplessness.

For a film ripe with sporadic editing, the pacing is rock solid. The tone is very, very deep into the terrifying uncertainty and vulnerability of the two lead characters. We see a relationship unfolding in the first act, focused on vulnerability, and then throughout the second act, we are subjected to experiments with and invasions of that vulnerability in its peak state... and in the third act it builds to a ferocious release of pure chaos.

There's a strange sci-fi ending that feels a bit gratuitous, but as a cognition of the incoherent rage, it's cathartic and necessary. The ending of the relationship with Betty and Bruce is left ambiguous, which only makes the impact of the journey all the more potent.

This film is a piece of art. The characters may not be charming or likeable, but they're sympathetic. And what little humor there is may be dry, but the true joy of this movie is seeing the beast unleashed. The action in this movie is ultra physical. It is no jumble of grays like the 2008 film, it is no comical joke like Avengers Hulk. It is a terrifying and kinetic rampage. It's a story that is a contradiction, both human and inhuman. It's a monster of a film.",10.0,7 January 2018

Replace the L with an N....and the H with a J...,"I have to admit I was a bit apprehensive when I heard that Ang Lee was going to direct The Hulk. I loved Crouching Tiger, but a film based around the feel of Chinese myth and legend is alot easier to accept for mostly unfamiliar western audiences than in creating an interpretation of a popular pulp-comic superhero that everyone knows and loves and which leaves you much more open to criticism. Everyone in their own mind has an idea of how this character should look and act, so you're going up against a mountainload of presumption. You've got to make it as good as people expect it, or better (i.e Lord Of The Rings, Spiderman, Superman...etc).

This is a failure on almost every level. Eric Bana, as far as I'm concerned, just doesn't have 'it' in order to be a leading man (I didn't even believe for a second his atrocious american accent in Blackhawk Down, a film full of atrocious american accents....). He's supposed to be wrestling with the creature inside him, before we ever actually get to see the creature inside him. Emotional turmoil is one thing. Total indifference is something else.

I know Mr Lee tried to flesh out the characters yet despite the amount of time he spends on them we still really learn very little. And he certainly does spend an inordinate amount of time on them, which in other movies I'd applaud; but we're dealing with a cartoon superhero here. My mindset is that if I want to see angst, love & understanding I'll watch American Beauty (a movie I love), but if I want to see a big green mutha smash heads I'll see The Hulk.

That's probably the biggest bugbear of all actually. In setting this character up so firmly in the real world, the monster that comes out looks completely unrealistic and not terribly unlike the drawing from the comicbook. It's almost like Ang said ""well let's make the movie as grounded in the real world as we possibly can, except for when the monster appears, then we'll use the worse CGI imagery we can possibly make (tho we'll put alot of it in darkness to save on the costs and people won't see how shoddy it is) and also no one will die (except some mutant dogs) even when they're thrown 4 miles in a tank or crash 100 metres down in a burning helicopter.

The effects in this film are nowhere near the level of many other movies that have been released recently. They're actually quite badly done. As far as CGI characters go, Gollum is most certainly miles ahead of the Un-Jolly Green Giant.

And what the heck's with the ending? What was that all about? Dad turns into non-physical energy being, both fall into a lake, plane sends nuke and............what?!?!?' I'm screwed if I can figure it out.

The split screens, obviously reminiscent of a comic book, somehow manage to be both endearing yet annoying at the same time. You can see what they're trying to do and give them points for trying, but eventually you'd wish they'd just stop.

For the movie that, well lets be honest, despite having Ang Lee at the helm I never really expected it to promise much anyway. But delivering absolutely nothing wasn't on the cards either. A cinematic non-event and a waste of time for anyone wanting to experience thrills and excitement.",,29 June 2003
A train wreck for comic-based films,"I was eager to see this one. As a frame of reference, I loved Spiderman, X-2, and thought Daredevil was so-so. The Hulk strikes me as lagging behind even Daredevil as the weakest entry in the comic book-based movies of late. It was truly a groaner, and the audience I was with seemed to react the same way. Here are the points against this film:

1. The tone was entirely wrong, both for fans of the comic, and I would add, entirely wrong for fans of action films. The trailers clearly billed this as an action film, not a heavy, brooding drama. That said, I had read reviews indicating that Ang Lee had placed a heavy emphasis on the story and character development, so I was actually excited because a comic book movie doesn't need to be superficial. However, there was no humor, no levity at all. It was painful. We've been conditioned with action films to have a few light-hearted moments here and there as a catharsis from the weightiness of conflict, but there were absolutely no intended humorous moments in this film. The only humor, unfortunately, came during very dramatic moments, as I found myself and the audience laughing at some rather corny lines and poor acting by the lead, Eric Bana. I will add that there is a scene toward the end where two characters are talking on a stage-like apparatus; it's supposed to be a moving moment, but instead, it was over-the-top and had the feeling of high school theatrics.

2. Filmic technique - I admit this is more according to my personal taste, but Mr. Lee used a lot of split-screens throughout the film. It was okay the first time, and indeed, they may have been impressively and seemlessly spliced/integrated into the film, but they were used far too often and distracted me. In fact, I had flashbacks to the 80's when my friends got their first camcorders and tried out all the panning and dissolving effects that they could. The film started to have that same cheap 80's experimental camcorder feel to it. Many of the multiple shots did nothing to serve the action. For example, three panes showing helicopters coming to fight The Hulk did nothing for me. It didn't reveal anything new to me.

3. Special effects - I agree with others who have expressed that the CGI just wasn't up to the task of depicting the Hulk. I thought the distant shots worked well enough, but the close-ups showed a creature slightly less believable than the original hand-puppet yoda. There were also a few scenes that looked very sloppily done. There's an explosion at one point, and the person being blown up had a cartoonish outline around him/her and was suspended in the air. I saw audience members groan and look at each other like ""was that supposed to look real?"" It was pitiful.

4. Convoluted plot - I would think that in most cases an action film has better pacing when the storyline is kept fairly simple or at the very least is coherent. Had the filmmakers chosen to stay true to the origins of the Hulk from the comic book, I think it would have worked much better. Instead, they spent a lot of time with techno/pseudo/medical jargon and psychobabble in making a storyline that was too complicated and tripped over itself many time. I was so sick of hearing the term 'repressed memories' thrown around by the end of the film. Too much talking about the main character's problems and too little showing. We were beat over the head with pseudo-heady dialogue at times that sounded like sci-fi crap, and Lee's surreal shots of molecules didn't help.

5. Poor lead actor - This will be a common refrain, but the lead, Eric Bana was a terrible choice. He was like a wooden version of Keanu Reeves, if you can conceive of that (Reeves is bad enough). The guy wilted every scene he was in, drained any energy and drama that the scene had to offer. I felt no sympathy for the character; he was like an android.

That's probably enough to make my point, but I could go on. Unfortunately, there aren't many positive points to make. There were some decent action sequences in the film, but not enough to warrant the time that I spent in the theatre. A definite thumbs-down for me.",3.0,21 June 2003

Ang lee is the Albert Einstein of Scifi,"Anglee is one of the most intelligent people in the industry and hulk is his best work till date. It has the psychological factor that no other film has not even AI or Clock work orange or 2001 Heshows that hulk is not just a comic book. He shows us the world where hulk is for real. He discourses upon the change in the society and the individual if the hulk were to exist. Not just the society , he explores the very psyche of the characters of Bruce banner and David banner and studies their minds in freeze frame and in detail as they progress from the beginning to the end. He also explores the nature of father son relationship in the context of a ""power obsessed "" yet intellectual father who analyzes and describes the society in detail without euphemisms and a son who views the world as good and works to make it a better place to live through science in spite of his poverty. The characters are 3D in Anglee's mind . Tf these characters were to exist in our world then characters like Talbot and Ross would automatically spring up. It seems like Anhlee has this little world in his mind where all laws of nature are valid and he is god in this little world and then he introduces his characters and the world changes in accordance with these laws and then he shoots all the changes in detail and shows it to us in the form of a film It is like best thought experiment since Albert Einsteins' when he discovered Relativity. Not only that there is a disturbing distortion in the film which gives the surrealist feeling of ""truth with out logic"" and ""More real than real"" and reminds us of Stanley Kubrick.

"A misfire for the giant green hero, slow and dull",,5.0,5 November 2017
mixed results,"A B-movie monster flick with an A-movie budget, `Hulk' is the latest epic based on a Marvel Comics superhero to hit the big screen. Director Ang Lee has constructed the film like a giant jigsaw puzzle, with images and events that often don't make a lot of sense when seen in isolation but which, when pieced together, form an interesting pattern once the overall picture is revealed.

Lee and his bevy of screenwriters have opted for a darker approach to their comic book material than, say, the one used for last year's `Spiderman.' The `hero' in this case is Bruce Banner, the conventional `mild-mannered' scientist who doesn't realize that he has been the victim of a genetic experiment that makes him (and his underpants) grow to enormous size whenever he is angered. Unlike Spiderman, Hulk doesn't go out looking to right wrongs, protect the innocent or bring arch-criminals to justice; he basically spends most of his time trying to escape from the army men out to destroy him before he can wreak too much havoc on the unsuspecting citizenry of the country.

Although `Hulk' is long, talky and slow-moving at times, it still boasts a few elements that elevate it above the bland innocuousness of the lighter-than-air `Spiderman.' One of those elements is the relationship between Bruce and his girlfriend, Betty, who seems genuinely conflicted about just how to deal with this suddenly gargantuan beau she has on her hands. Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly establish an impressive on-screen rapport that gives the film more depth than it would otherwise have had. Sam Elliott and Nick Nolte ham it up effectively as the youngsters' fathers, the first as a top military leader bent on containing Hulk's deadly and destructive fits of explosive pique, and the second as Bruce's mad-scientist father whose penchant for playing God 35 years ago served as the catalyst for the unique problems besetting the young Bruce today.

As to the film's expensive special effects, they are a decidedly mixed bag, to say the least. Hulk looks pretty impressive in the facial close-ups, but he often appears ludicrous in long shot, particularly when he is bouncing around from boulder to boulder out in the desert. It is enough to make one thankful that Steven Spielberg made `E.T.' twenty some years ago, long before CGI effects ruled the land. Otherwise, we might have ended up with an alien far less cuddly, believable and real than the one we fell in love with. Sometimes `progress' is not always synonymous with `improvement.'

Lee also relies heavily on the use of split-screen images, a visual style that is sometimes effective in capturing the fragmentation of Bruce's mind, personality and world, and sometimes just plain irritating in its pretentiousness and artifice. Like virtually everything about `Hulk,' the look of the film seems both daring and dorkey at the same time.",,15 July 2003
"Boring, Long, and not Fun to watch.","The set up was long and tedious. Over an hour before he turns in the Hulk. Not enough action, not funny, not fun to watch. The crowd at the movie was bored. Kids were throwing candy. I don't blame them, you had to do something to kill time in between the action. What a bust!",1.0,20 June 2003
Two Styles Poorly Combined,"The problem with Hulk is that it was trying to be an art-house film for a summer blockbuster crowd. At one point it's trying to be a psychological film then a balls-to-the-wall action.

The actors were fine with what they were given. I liked Bana as Banner and wouldn't have mind seeing him return. Elliot was a good Ross. I liked how he wasn't portrayed as such a straight-forwards villain like the Hurt version.

Lee does have a definitive style. The film certainly does look good. Sure the split screen, comic book does put me out of the film, but there's a certain style to it all.

I do like all the action stuff. I enjoyed the CGI, and never really got why people berated the Hulk so much.

It's just that all the action is in conflict with the tone of the film. You got this odd fight with VW-sized poodles and then some weird scene where Nolte is talking about his wife and a knife ""becoming one.""

Either Lee should have stuck with a cerebral, indy style movie or gone full force into the summer action film. But the two are just too conflicted. I'm not saying that a Hulk movie needs to be big, loud, and dumb. Bill Bixby's series proved that an intelligent Hulk adaptation can work in live action. But the way it was done here just made it seem schizophrenic.

A Green Hulking Success,"A truly spectacular movie by a renowned director, the Hulk has arrived! The character and situational development succeeds whether plenty of other action movies fail, it makes the viewer feel for hero, Bruce Banner. Eric Bana has completed his personal transformation from up-and-coming actor to a genuine Hollywood star.

Although the movie was a little slow at the start, when the action started, it rarely slows down. My favorite action scene was when the Hulk squared off against the military (pure action and testosterone). The CGI Hulk was amazing, complete with emotional expressiveness and realistic body movement. A true achievement in the world of Computer-Generated Imagery.

Plenty of credit to Ang Lee. A true master at the helm of a masterpiece. The Hulk...one the summer 2003's greatest blockbusters!",10.0,19 June 2003
Fades and Wipes,This is the only movie I have seen where 20 million dollars of the budget was spent on fades and wipes.

100% Unadulterated Doo Doo,"Surprisingly I was very impressed by the CGI of the Hulk, which was the one thing I wondered about before seeing this. But, the compliments stop there. This steamy pile of crap makes Dare Devil look like Lord of the Rings.

First of all, Ang Lee found a new toy on his camera. 3 scenes at once, one scene from 2 angles at once, scenes sliding to another scene over and over. STOP IT. Yes, we understand going for the comic book feel and it's nice that someone tried to step out of the box. But damnit, there's a cutting room for a reason.

The script. . next time.. or actually, just don't let there be a next time.

This wasn't quite crap to end all crap, but it's way up there. People don't want to hear about the Hulk fighting with his Dad and his Dad's ultimate anti-climactic revenge gone wrong. They want to see the Hulk kicking butt, period. ""You won't like me when I'm angry,"" is how the movie should start, not end.

The Day Comic Book Movies Get Flushed in the Toilet,"I don't know what idiot decided to try and make a comic book movie into a dark drama. Comic book movies should be full out summer popcorn flicks and not a dramatic art piece. I haven't been more bored during a movie since Phone Booth and even when the Hulk was on the screen I could care less. The basic plot of this movie was guy turns into a big dumb animal with alot of rage and the army wants to contain him. That's it. So was there going to be more of a story. Oh wait there was Betty who loved him. Oh yes, the power of love that can control Shrek on steriods. Why was that movie 2 hours, they could of fit that movie into a tv mini series and it still wouldn't of been better.

o.k. and nothing more,"The Hulk is like 2 separate movies. The first hour and a half is one movie and the last half hour is a mini movie.

When the Hulk is on the screen its just amazing and despite what a lot of people think, I actually liked the CGI in this move. People say he looked fake but even if you actually saw a 15 foot green monster he probably wouldn't look real anyway. I've seen some real life zoo animals that don't look real. The hulk looked fine and they really captured the strength and power of the character unlike any other superhero movie I've seen. You could just tell he would whoop up on the movie superman. But outside of the 25 minutes hes on screen this is just a boring movie. Its really a shame because the acting was really good especially Sam Elliot, though Glen Talbot was a little over the top. My buddy fasts forward through the first hour and a half and so do I. No matter how good the last half hour is you just cant give a movie like that a good review.

"man, this movie sucks","i only have one word to describe The Hulk; BORING. This film just drags on and on and on. Ang Lee probably could have chopped 45 mins out of it.

However I thought the CGI was sweet and he looked a bit cartoony but that was sweet because he is a 20ft green monster after all.",5.0,8 July 2003
A very good film that many people will not like.,"If you see the Hulk on the premise of just seeing the trailer that was run during the Super Bowl, then you will go to see this film already with a bad taste in your mouth and you will probably not like Ang Lee's version. Let me clear one thing up; the CGI Hulk looks good and does not resemble the Hulk from the Super Bowl trailer. With this in mind let me hit the positives and negatives of this film.

On the positive side, and overall, Hulk is a good film. Ang Lee does a good job of creating his vision of the big green guy. Lee focuses on Bruce Banner the man more than he does Bruce Banner as the Hulk. I actually like this concept but I know most people won't (I'll get to this in my negative thoughts). The effects are very good, but Lee does not rely on them to drive his film. He uses the story, which is a pretty basic concept. Bruce's dad was a mad scientist type who worked for the military and tried his experiments on his own son. Bruce is a messed up adult who has issues and this is where Eric Bana (who plays Bruce) shines. He is hurting and you sympathize with that. Lee uses the actors very well, and all do a good job. I also liked Lee's use of adding storyboards in his film (it makes it feel like a comic book). As for the Hulk himself, he looks very good. He is not shown as just some brainless monster who wants to smash any and everything. He is Bruce's rage, but he is also a beast who hurts inside as much as Bruce does and this is shown in Hulk's expressions (a great scene is when Hulk meets Bruce's dad). The film is more of an emotional roller coater ride than it is action packed, but their is still some good ol Hulk smashing in the film as well.

Now for the negatives. Lee is not Michael Bay, and he is not trying to be. He set out to make a movie based solely on a personal story than having the Hulk run around and destroy stuff all through the film. This is not a bad idea, but one of Lee's faults was choosing to have Hulk in the film for 20-30 minutes, and for die-hard Hulk fans that simply won't do. Second, Lee drags the movie to almost two and a half hours. The ending of the film was less than stellar, if not a little confusing.

Overall, this is a very good film that many people will not like simply because their is not enough Hulk and not enough action.",,11 September 2003
run dont walk AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE,"god awful, i wanted to shoot myself in the face with a shotgun while i was watching this movie, i saw the bootleg 2 weeks before the release then saw it in theaters and thought it was even stupider. horrible actors (minus jennifer connelly) very super cool cinemetography, that whole comic book feel was a cool concept, CG hulk wasnt so bad, but a bit too greenish, i thought i was watching shrek 2, but oh well.

Bottom line....the movie....didnt suck, it was just really weird the story was way off the comic and too lovey dovey for a comic book movie

DONT SEE IT WAIT UNTIL ITS ON TV NOT EVEN AT BLOCKBUSTER",1.0,21 June 2003
Bland,"Who is Bruce Banner? Bruce Krenzler? This film goes to extreme measures to show the man beneath the ""Hulk"". Through two hours of endless dialogue, disjointed dreams and fragmented flashbacks, you leave the film just as confused as when it started. The script is convoluted and the relationship between Bruce and his father is never fully understood. Really, Bruce's relationship with everyone (Betty, Talbot, Ross) is never developed.

Casting Eric Bana as Bruce was a mistake. Though the character is supposed to be mild-mannered and emotionally reserved, Bana's performance is just plain vanilla. Other than Jennifer Connelly, the entire cast is cartoonish and the dialogue has mediocre delivery. Though there is much more talking than smashing in this film (which I usually prefer), you never really understand any character motivations. I can forgive the bad CGI, but I cannot forgive the lack of direction and blandness of this film. Hulk makes the 2008 The Incredible Hulk look like a masterpiece and I called that film ""borderline unwatchable"".",3.0,14 September 2021
"Over directed, under acted, and boring!","I have to admit I am not a huge fan of comic books or the Hulk. I still thought it might be pretty good because I did like the television show and Ang Lee at the helm, what could go wrong. I'm guessing someone forgot to tell Ang Lee this was about a comic book character and not Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon II. I do like and have read the comic books of Batman, Spider-Man, and X-Men. So I figured this would be just as good. So I know comic books can have a good story and drama to tell. The plot and story of the Hulk are not the problem, it is the acting and directing. The acting was not too boring, but close enough. The actors and acting seem to be as dry as cardboard and reading from a script that is just as dry. Both Eric Bana and Sam Elliot act like Al Gore showing little if any emotion. The only bright spot to the acting was Jennifer Connelly carrying her oscar winning acting from A Beautiful Mind to the Hulk.

Now there is the directing to the Hulk. At first the comic book style split screen was cool and neat, but after fifteen minutes it got real annoying. Mr. Lee I think the audience knew the movie was based on a comic book. There also seemed to be a large number of cuts and of fade ins and outs, like every thirty seconds. Then there are the action scenes which are far and few between. I thought the CGI effects looked really good, so tell me why most of the action scenes where shot in complete darkness. Finally can anyone tell me what was with the sequence in the middle of the main action scene when the Hulk suddenly appears and says ""punny human."" Why did the studio get Ang Lee and not Tim Burton, Sam Raimi, Bryan Singer, or even Richard Donner to direct this. These directors might not have done any better with this so called grade ""A"" material. The Hulk ranks with another disappointing comic book movie Dare Devil both earning 1.5 stars out of 4 or a D+.",2.0,25 July 2003
Great movie....,"I guess Hulk was a great great movie, it was directed by an Asian director so thats the reason for the slow action in the first half of the movie.

I m a fan of that kind of films I guess the people in America needs to learn how to watch that kind of movies, movies are not only fast action, fast jokes or fast jumps (thats the USA style), and every movie which is out of that stuff is rated a bad movie.

THAT WAS EXACTLY THE VERSION OF HULK THAT I WAS WAITING..... By the way, the style reminds me the movie Unbreakeable (i like that movie too)

Thats the reason of all the remakes of Asian movies (ring,grudge,dark water and the list keeps growing and even not only Asian movies, like the awesome movie from Spain ""Abre los Ojos"" with the US remake Vanilla Sky)

disappointing after the x-men and spiderman - SPOILERS,,4.0,3 July 2003
A little thing I like to call hype...,"Hype is never spared in a comic book adapted movie you can't escape the trailers and coming attractions but if it's something along the lines of the Hulk I would've added some more trailers not because the hulk was an amazing experience but because after people see this movie and tell their friends the hulk won't be seeing much green after all. Disappointment isn't even the word. It was like watching a car wreck it's a terrible thing but sometimes you have to watch the destruction take place.if anybody gave their life for this I truly hope you are in hell, better hope Satan wasn't a hulk fan.

Now about the movie the only two people I will give credit to is Eric Bana and Jennifer Connoley they were two sparkling diamonds in a collapsing mine but unfortunately not even their performances could've saved them from the wreckage. Now for the others who made attempts at `acting' in this accident please let this be your last film and if not stick to the possible hulk sequels I just can't bear to see you in anything else. Two words kids Nick Nolte. Not to mention the ever so predictable split screens and cut out outlines used to resemble comic book panels and comic books in general. Just stop please, these effects were so over used I desperately tried to gouge my eyes out so I wouldn't have to see them again but hey what would that solve I'd still have to listen to the excruciating dialogue. I think I could be immortal because if I were meant to die god would've taken me away from that theater and sent me to heaven because if you see this movie and don't kill yourself you are in his eyes a saint. However, the people in the theater with me weren't so lucky so I ask you now please keep the audience of theater 6 in your prayers tonight. God Bless you.

Moving on, the worst piece of computer animation since Jar Jar Binks (there I said it) the Hulk. Ginormous in size while the original hulk was big but not a giant I sat wondering how long until the hulk takes on a true green monster Godzilla. The hulk in many people's eyes was comical not intimidating, scary, or even endearing he was a joke a clown there for all our amusement. A big green clown who jumps 3 miles how could anybody go wrong with that, sheer gold.

I also believe I shall boycott anything any Lee involved with the hulk creates unless it's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon 2 or X3 you remember the good films you were a part of. I'd include Spiderman 2 but that'll be a chance as well and I can't afford to take a chance on a Stan Lee production.

Big green storm cloud,"Good and bad.

The Hulk sure delivered what it promised. So if you're ready for another big budget, badly written, comic book adaptation... you'll love it. However, as a true fan of the cartoon... I must say that the movie's story itself was a huge disappointment.

Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, and Nick Nolte all gave stunning performances, and the CGI was incredible.

A 6/10 I'd say. If this movie was compressed and made much shorter at its beginning and its end... it's probably deserve an 8/10.

Nice special effects! Good acting! Terrible editing!,"Hulk is yet another Marvel hero translated to the big screen and where it is not a failure altogether it is not an undisputed success either. In short there were things I liked and there were things that I didn't like.

I like Ang Lee's approach to the film by letting the characters have the main focus. A lot of time is taken in building up the characters so they become believable and important to the viewers. This is partly because the actors are very good. Eric Bana who has since gone on to star in Troy does a good job in portraying the vulnerable and scarred scientist, Bruce Banner. He comes across pretty nerdy but unlike Peter Parker in Spider-Man, he doesn't overdo it. He also portrays the changes the character goes through in a satisfactory manner. Jennifer Connely is good as well but I think the character resembles her previous character from A Beautiful Mind a bit too much. Sam Elliot plays General Ross and does so with a lot of authority and it works to an extent because sometimes the character is reduced to simple anger and that is in my opinion not the best way of portraying the character which could have done with some poise. The best performance out of the bunch is undoubtedly Nick Nolte who is not only extremely menacing but also multi layered as Bruce Banner's father. He has a few explosions of incredible acting that left me gasping for air but he also knew when to be subtle and let someone else take control of the scene. A very fine performance.

The effects are good. Not the best I've seen but good. Ang Lee tried to make the film seem as real as possible instead of trying to create a comic book atmosphere like Sam Raimi did in Spider-Man. The Hulk itself is well done. Not superb like Gollum from LotR but still very impressive. A thing which I thought was very distracting was the film's way of letting people know it was in fact a superhero movie. It does so by sometimes letting the screen be divided into several boxes like on a comic book page. I felt this was very disturbing and took away focus from the characters in the scenes where it occurred.

I have to comment on Danny Elfman's music as well. I have to say that this is not the best he has done. The score resembles the score from Red Dragon a lot. It was still good but in my opinion not quite up to the usual high standard of Elfman's work. He was probably hired because he did the music for both Batman (1989) and Spider-Man which are both excellent musical scores and Hulk does have a few good points but it is much more forgettable than in the other films.

Where the film truly suffers is in the fact that it is just too slow. Even though I like the fact that time is taken to build up the characters and make them believable 20 minutes could have easily been left out on the editing board. Not just character driven scenes but also effects scenes which seemed to drag on forever. The film was just too slow at times and that made the film suffer a lot. I'm not addicted to action but I do think that it is possible for pacing to be too slow which is probably why I don't like too many old films and the pacing is too slow in this film which in my opinion almost ruins the film. I couldn't help but yawn several times in spite of the good acting. Also the climax of the film wasn't all too great either. It felt kind of rushed and was over in 3 minutes. With all the action in the film I would have liked a more action packed ending.

In conclusion I have to say that Hulk had potential. Hulk had vast potential. It could have been one of the best superhero movies as both acting and effects were good but the pacing was just too unbearable. Ang Lee told a good story but because of the poor pacing it didn't quite catch me and that really is a shame. If a sequel does come along I hope they hire another editor.

If you're expecting another Spider Man,"then this might not be your cup of tea, because it's not that kind of film. It's a lot more dark and slower-paced, and has less humor and action. That may sound boring, but it's actually one of the most interesting films I've seen all year. I was glued to my seat for the whole two hours and twenty minutes. My friend didn't like it, however, and the audience had very strongly mixed reactions; some were actually cheering, while a few others nodded off (namely the guy behind me who started snoring loudly right before the mutant dog scene. It made a really weird accompaniment) but like I said, I was totally hooked, so proceed at your own risk.",10.0,30 June 2003

I gave it 4 stars because it is the Hulk after all!",4.0,4 May 2020
Comic book style and story,"First off, this movie was better than I thought it would be. I think the central reason why I enjoyed it so much, though, had to do with the method of storytelling. Most comic book movies tend to take a comic book story and put it into a regularly styled film. However, Ang Lee went one further and actually incorporated comic book style into the film. From the beginning, I was amazed at the cut techniques he was using. At first, I found it interesting, but distracting. However, once I really began to see the purpose behind it, I thought it was genius. There is a distinct method to his framing, and the way in which he put up storyboard-style shots onto the screen with various overlays was really, really neat. It got a little over-the-top with the frozen shot of Talbot dying, but at least it drilled home the point that this was a comic book movie.

Hopefully, though, the story clued you in that this was a comic book flick. This story is just downright awful. As my friend pointed out, ""It was great, though, it just gave them a reason to make 'Hulk SMASH!'"" Heh heh...yup, that's right. It was pointless. However, the story may have been as shallow as can be, but that only adds to the comic book style of the film. When you really get down to it, a single comic book by itself is pretty shallow -- you introduce one aspect of the character, one dimension of his previous life, and then you have him fight someone. What makes the characters is the fact that there are tens of comic books about a given character. This works here, too, though I really, really hope there is no sequel.

The acting was okay. Eric Bana was decent as the dorky, emotionless scientist. I think a lot of this was due to his concentrating on Americanizing his accent, though, but that was fine 'cause it forced him to give a very stiff performance. Jennifer Connelly's character was just boring, so I can't really comment on her acting...it seemed like filler to me. Nick Nolte was stupendous as David Banner (old), and Paul Kersey was actually really good in his brief shots as David Banner (young). Everyone else isn't worth mentioning. Talbot's character is shallow as hell, but I suppose it was still played well by Josh Lucas. The military general or whomever he was supposed to be was just downright silly, so I'm not even going to try to comment on him seriously. I just hope it was the role and not the actor.

The CGI was alright. I personally got sick of the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" bounding leaps that the Hulk made, and I really, really hated the ending to the film...it was actually very anti-climactic, and the battle didn't even look that good, disappointingly enough, though I like the man/cloud scene. The close-ups of the Hulk and his face were okay, but he just looked too out of place in most scenes. I'm not convinced that's not how it's supposed to be, though, given that he's a stinking neon green giant.

All in all, the movie was okay. The style made it worth watching for me, and it was definitely entertaining. Realistically, I'd give it a 6/10. However, given how slanted the IMDB ratings are (how many movies have you seen below a 6?), I'll probably rate it a 7.",,24 June 2003

Where did it all go wrong?,,2.0,1 November 2003
A masterpiece,"""The Hulk"" didn't obtain unanimously positive critics and it's sadly understandable considering the issues that critics and a part of the audience seem to have when it comes to deal with something they can't easily put in a pre-established category. Hulk is probably one of the best comic adaptation ever made ""but"" it asks the viewer an exceptional maturity and a certain capacity to accept the conventions to be tumbled down. In fact if ""The Hulk"" seemed so hard to comprehend, maybe that's because it marks for the first time the perfect balance point between author film and blockbuster. It's about family, the frailty of human condition,an initiation tale, the repression, the social confinement,... There are a whole lot of subtexts in ""The Hulk"". A very few people seemed to realize the difficulties that Ang lee had to deal with, directing the movie adapted from the misadventures of the first super hero whose the enemy would be his own nature.

For the action sequences, Lee did put entire pages of the original comic book in motion. All the fierce power of the creature is there, treated in such a way that the viewer is like in the core of the action, to make him/her intimately feel the visual fury.

The best proof of the greatness of this film is the way it influence, without no one ever noticed, critically acclaimed followers like ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""Batman Begins"".

Incredible,"What the girl who sells the ticket says about the movie shouldn't matter. No one can speak for the likes of Fritz Lang, Hitchcock, Kubrick. They're dead. Don't put words in their mouth. And honestly, what any other director thinks about the movie or ESPECIALLY what an initial test audience thought about the film shouldn't matter either. The fact that we've been annoyed and bombarded with marketing is easy to understand, but that's a complaint seperate from the film itself. What matters is what you think of the film itself, outside of all of these influences. ""THE HULK, far from achieving its pretentious aim as an in-depth psychological drama wherein the hapless Banner contemplates his inner self and his seemingly inexplicable laboratory-rage, falls apart at the seams every which way "". What has been described here is one of the key scenes in the film, in which all of the elements of the movie that have been previously introduced culminate and Banner loses his grip on civility and his repressed memories create a new persona.Banner, being very damaged emotionally, can no longer deal with: 1. His girl keeping him at a distance and in fact trying to end their private relationship while maintaining a professional one. Her reason for distancing herself is that she needs more from a lover emotionally (in other words, he is somehow inadequate) and something about him makes her afraid, uncomfortable. 2. His work is being seriously threatened by both the military and a privatized military organization/big business called Atheon (possibly a veiled reference to abandonment lack of morality or conscience, personified by a corporate slug who also represents a threat to Banner's relationship with Betty. Talbot has announced Atheon's intentions to make Banner's medical research into a terrifying weapon. Lately NPR aired a report about the inherent dangers of privatized military that has no real regulation operating on a global scale. In the film, and whatever one's stance on the role of the military (personified by Ross) I think we can all understand the inherent threat and danger that it can pose. In addition, Ross poses a threat as an angry father, and shows immense hostility toward Dr. Banner. 3. Banner's own body has been infected with his experiment and altered on a molecular level. Talk to anyone who has been diagnosed with an STD or any incurable disease of the blood about the initial horror of knowing that there is something in your blood and body that you that you cannot control. It must be especially horrifying if the infecting agent is something new, unknown. 4. Banner's father has suddenly appeared and tried to impose himself upon Banner's life, unwanted. His father forces him to deal with a past that he has tried to ignore, to the point that his mind has actually removed these grim events from his memory. But you can't simply ignore the past, eventually it rears its ugly head.

So all of these elements culminate and Banner's mind creates a new persona that can deal with these threats for him (this is the nature of MPD). At this point the film changes gears and expresses Banner's anguish mythologically. What happens next is that the creature emerges in a marvelous sequence that on a stylistic level draws elements from 50's drive-in sci-fi/horror. The creature emerges from horrific close-ups of eyes, teeth, hands transforming, raises his arms defiantly and lets loose a birth cry; one might imagine that the creature's howl is that of the sound of the dawn of time. The Hulk is a primal force that lurks deep within the soul of Man, and has finally found a release. After throwing an initial tantrum, the Beast heads for the source of Banner's anguish and that which created the Hulk. He tears out the metal sphere and raises it up on his shoulders, pausing for a moment in the stance of mighty Atlas hefting the Earth on his back, and tosses the sphere through a wall. Next the beast sees his father. The Hulk can feel rage and pain and passion, so he has no need of repression and recognizes his father. They share a tender moment, and then the Hulk remembers the worst of the father and turns away, hurtling through the night and howling as the man who created this Hulk, both physically and emotionally, weeps. A little hokey, but this is a nod to Dr. Frankenstein crying ""It's Alive"".

This scene did not fall apart at the seams. The seams of this film are very, very sound. As to the effects, I ask critics to take another look at Spider-Man, specifically scenes in which Peter is leaping on rooftops. The audience seemed to be able to suspend disbelief then and simply enjoy the movie, but not for the Hulk. And personally, I thought the Hulk looked just fine. Amazing, even. His facial expressions were very well done. His skin and muscles have very complex definition. He reflects like and gathers dust. Most importantly, he moves like a real person. A savage person, but real nonetheless. Critics have attacked the way that the Hulk leaps. The leaping was true to the comic and very much like what is called lucid dreaming- common lucid dreamers experience the sensation of flying free from the restraints of civilization and even gravity.

Eric Bana did a fantastic job of portraying a man who cannot express or understand his emotion. The reason people don't respond to him is that he is not charismatic, not funny, very much a repressed man. He'd have to be to have all of that Hulk in him. I think no one could have done a better job.

Personally I think Ang Lee made the best comic book and monster movie I've ever seen. I do not object to his trying to treating the material like an artist rather than a entrepreneur. I think this is one of the most misunderstood movies of the year and I hope he returns to direct a sequel.",,19 July 2003

The Hype is a Bit Overrated,"I was fortunate enough to see an advanced sneak preview of the HULK, and I must admit that even though I was skeptical of seeing the flick because of the CGI and one ugly looking Hulk, I was still curious and heck it was free!

I must applaud and give an A+ to the CGI team for their exceptional detail of the HULK. The CGI was interacted into the movie a lot more seamlessly than seen in Spiderman, particularly when good 'ol Peter Parker was web slinging after his uncles murderer.

While the movie was over two hours long (2:17 min), I found my rump going numb. The movie tends to drag on for a little over an hour while it is laying down the foundation for its characters. Also, if you weren't a fan of the comics but instead a fan of the series it takes a little time to adjust to the new bios.

The ""Goo"" team went a little overboard with their colorful yet simple graphics which are silly enough to overlook, but the comic book frame borders for scene transitions to give us that comic book feel, while neat at first, tend to become a tad excessive. All in all, the theme of the movie was just your basic love story verses a little dysfunctional parenting, with missile toting testosterones thrown in.

Although far from perfect and slightly overlong I was pleased that the filmakers obviously took the subject matter seriously. If your attention span can't stretch to 2 hours I suggest you stick to cartoons.

I also thought the Hulk was brilliantly realised to look like a mutation between Eric Bana and the Hulk character familiar to everyone. CGI in this film was 95% convincing and never a distraction, a criticism I felt was justified in the fight sequences of Matrix Reloaded which ended up looking like a video game...",8.0,8 November 2003

Surprisingly boring and slow,"Finally arriving after months of hype and trailers, Hulk is of course the big-screen version of the Incredible Hulk, which is/was both a comic from Marvel and a TV series. In the TV series the Hulk was played by Lou Ferrigno - here he's computer generated.

The story could have been simpler, and less contrived, but hey it's a Marvel comic isn't it? Bruce Banner, as a child, experiences traumatic events which become repressed memories, and in later life when he becomes a genetics scientist it all comes back after an accident at his lab.

The truth is for all the material at their disposal, this movie ended up being really rather dull. It takes way too long for anything of interest to happen, and when it does, it just seems to be going through the motions. And that's another flaw - at no point did I feel any great sympathy for the Hulk/Bruce Banner. Because of the plodding pace of the story, characterisation is really rather poor. Shallow performances don't help, along with some really grating dialogue. However, to baffling contrast everyone else, Nick Nolte completely overacts his part and ends up looking like a raving loony whose performance you laugh at.

Another thing lacking here is humour - there's a total lack of funny moments - the movie takes itself so seriously it forgets to smile.

Overall a wasted opportunity to make a thrilling and exciting movie.

Big Screen tv version...,"There's a term for it: ""re-imagining."" That's short for: ""If you can't beat it, rip it off and put your name on it."" Happens in comics all the time. Now, it's happening on the Big Screen- and the filmmakers seem, more often than not, to be taking their cues from (of ALL places!) television. It is to weep. Most television is so bereft of drama or originality that it is literally mind-numbing: one lapses into a trance-like state; the eyes glaze over and one sits, unseeing, as the mind clouds and darkness seeps into one's immortal soul. Don't take long.

I refer you to the first hour or so of this alleged motion picture.

Banal? You wouldn't believe... Derivative? Don't get me started. Why, you ask, am I so unsettled by what I've seen? The answer's simple enough: I literally learned to read by having my mother read comic books to me when I was a kid. Loved every panel of it. (She stopped reading to me the day I corrected her.) Stanley Leiber (""Stan Lee"") and Jacob Kurtzberg (""Jack Kirby"") may never be confused with the Great Authors, but they sure as heck knew how to tell a story.

THE INCREDIBLE HULK was a staple of my childhood- from the first issue, on. Simple premise, uncluttered and clean, beautifully delineated; unlike this hodgepodge. Oh, the cartoon segments are fantastic, but the ""drama"" falls flat on its freakin' face. Much ado, and all that- the kind of pretentiousness that has seeped into comics for years, now (which are little more than regurgitations of episodic tv storylines).

Let's hope that THE MIGHTY THOR stays true to its roots (and is set in Asgard, and not on Earth) and is given the same top-of-the-line treatment as the second entry in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.",2.0,30 July 2003
"I went to the Early show, and still a waste of money!","I'm a big fan of movies of these types. Loved X-men and Spiderman. But this movie has some serious flaws. First off the complete lack of a plot. Secondly, you spent half the movie in flashbacks. How many times did we have to see him under the table as a child. They could have saved 45 minutes of film easy. what more, the action scenes were very poor and predictable. Not to mention, after seeing the advertisments for the movie you had already SEEN ALL the action scenes. Instead of trying to develop the movie, the director went for a money maker, depending on hype to make his movie for him. If I can save one person their money, my time was worth while.",1.0,30 June 2003
Where's Hulk? Wait and wait some more...,"X Men had me spoiled with the ability to inject adrenaline into a scene, even during character development. In 'Hulk' there is no -zing-, despite many kinetic transitions. There is an expectation of some gratification for patiently sitting through background material. This movie reminded me of 'Signs"". I sat there, knowing this was a summer blockbuster, which gives the audience expectations that they are going to see some eye popping special effects. What happens is too little, too late. Once again an action film has no business clocking in over 2 hours. I sat in on a matinee, with a pile of kids. After the first hour of droll dialogue, the kids were screaming up and down the aisles. Someone took our their cell phone and started gabbing out loud. (He was later persuaded to talk in the lobby). I frankly didn't blame them. Remember the seat numbing amount of time before we got to see the goods in 'Pearl Harbor'? The action finally comes in one big spurt, and even so, quickly shifts back into Park. It's like waiting two hours in line to ride a fancy roller coaster, and it's over in like a minute. It's not worth the wait.

Truly Outstanding!,"I have been really looking forward to this picture since i heard it was being made and I can honestly say it did not dissapoint me one bit!

I tend to think that making big budget movies involving comic book heroes is something that has to be done in a certain way to please the majority.

The people are avid lovers of comic books are very very hard to please, as they are constantly looking for things relate to the comic....where I myself, was a big fan of the TV series.

The acting was inspiring. Bana is not your stereotypical, chiselled leading man and played the troubled Bruce Banner perfectly. Jennifer Connelly had a nice role and gets thumbs up from me as she has never really done much more me. Nick Nolte was awesome......playing the part in a brilliant 'over the top' manner and looking just like he did in that infamous police mugshot when he was arrested.

Ang Lee has given us a superb film here....lots of emotion and insight into the troubled mind of Bruce Banner.

This film was a lot darker than Spiderman, but the Hulk is a much darker character. I wish Ang Lee could have directed Batman!!

Also, the effects are breathtaking....after a while, you forget the Hulk is animated and there is such sadness in its eyes......but when it loses its temper, you can almost feel the rage inside yourself!!!!

I really hope if there is a sequel, Lee is behind the camera.

The best comic book film thats been made.......so far!!!!!",,4 August 2003
Fair,"Great genre fair film. Maybe the sequel will be better with different director. Kind of dark film. The dog fight was good. Kind of too much social work stuff. Nick Nolte the father is always a good actor and the acting was good. A lot of flash backs and could have been more suspenseful. Ok film because science fiction and comics go good but this director Ang Lee does not really get it.

More action towards the end. 5 stars not in Spidermans league. The TV show was better because bullets could harm the Bixby character on TV and so that more suspenseful.",5.0,29 June 2003

The plot, the random comic book scene changes, and of course Nick Nolte's giant rabid dogs put the stamp on this movie for movie suicide. I am deeply disappointed that respectable actors such as Nick Nolte, Eric Bana, and Jennifer Conelly did not tear the script apart and warn others never to read it. They must really love money.

It's not a complete disaster... the camera angles, simulating a comic book, were pretty interesting, and the battle between Hulk and the mutant dogs is breathtaking. The rest is quite boring. The movie just spends a lot of time setting up the story, and the payoff is not good enough. The action scenes are pretty anti climatic and devoid of all tension or suspense, with the exception of the dogs scene. One mayor disappointment comes when Hulk must fight his own father. This should have been the most exciting of the battles; remember, leave the best for last. The fight between Hulk and his father is incredibly short and is ended in an abrupt, completely anti climatic way. I can't believe they could end the movie the way they did. It sucked, sucked, sucked. I preferred X2, thanks.",,17 January 2004

Note: This should not be considered a movie.,"You cannot begin to fathom my disgust when I began watching this film. Not only was I disappointed that one of my favorite comic book characters was simply obliterated in front of me, but it made me sad and sick to my stomach that actors, writers, and directors just don't care about their job or the work they release since year 2000. with few exceptions, the millennium is a sea of horrible movies, and we are the excrement flowing with it. As expected as a rape in jail, this 'End of the World As We Know It' movie is full of crap. Bad acting, horrible script (VERY), I cannot believe this was ever made.

The Hulk falls flat,"After walking out of the theater showing Ang Lee's Hulk, I asked myself two questions: `Why in the world did I spend some hard-earned money on a ticket to see it?' and `What were they thinking?' The writing for this movie is just awful. It seemed as though the first hour would never end as we learn of Bruce Banner's tragic past. I heard people groaning in the crowd as Eric Bana's Bruce Banner and Jennifer Connally's Betty Ross kept talking and talking and talking. I was under the impression that this was an action movie, yet most of the first half is dedicated to the action of people running their mouths. Worse yet, the characters overstate the obvious! They repeat situations out loud that we've already seen on the screen. Forget more careful editing they should have thrown out most of this movie! The audience waited for Banner to undergo his blast of gamma radiation and change into the Hulk. They waited and waited and when it finally happened, the Hulk appears onscreen for a few moments, throws a few things around, then smashes through a wall and runs away. Wow. We waited that long to see this? Later, when the Hulk goes on a smashing spree, the things they chose to do leave you wanting more. But great, memorable scenes just don't happen here. Even the great Sam Elliot's performance as General Ross couldn't save this movie from the horrible overacting of Nick Nolte and the dull performance of Bana. Even the action scenes were poorly done in spots. As the Hulk is fleeing from the military, this horrible slow music is playing in the background with whistles and whatnot. Ang Lee, this may have worked for Crouching Tiger, but it is horribly misplaced here. Lee also elected to show parts of the movie in panels, seventies-style. My guess is that he wanted to show it like a comic book with panels. Instead, it just annoyed me. The creature is impressive; it is just not used enough. They must have had only so much dough to spend on the computer-generated Hulk and the enormous marketing campaign (Hulk Cereal, anyone?) that they skimped on screenwriting and had to fill in time with useless babble. Stay away if you're looking for a good action movie, or even a decent superhero movie. Go rent Superman or Spider-Man or whatever.

Everything just seemed very real and humanistic which really appealed to me. Once the action kicks in Lee doesn't forget about the drama tho...and that's a good thing as it is easy to get lost in the scope and fury of Hulk's rages. The big guy looked phenomenal! This is the Hulk form the comics. PERIOD. The desert battle with the army is some of the most spectacular action I have ever seen on film. Everyone turned in solid acting performances but Bana and Nolte really shined. Bana has the most expressive and soulful eyes I have ever seen.

Hulk makes me happy,"When I first learned of the new Hulk movie my curiosity had been piqued, and after first seeing the trailer it became even clearer to me how much I wanted to see the movie. At this time my expectations were very high, and the moment I'd reserved a ticket to see Marvel Comics' favorite green-skinned hero on the big screen, I felt very excited. By the time the movie had finished I wasn't left feeling disappointed at all. My expectations had been met and more than that - the movie exceeded them. It was my introduction to Australian actor Eric Bana, whose performance as Bruce Banner is by far better than Bill Bixby's in the old TV series and a few older Hulk movies. Bana IS Bruce Banner. Nick Nolte fits in wonderfully in his combined father / villain role, and Jennifer Connelly is perfect as Bruce's romantic interest Betty Ross. The chemistry is there. The interpretation of the Hulk character is flawless; kudos to the animation crew. The story is very well told in a wonderful mix between very touching drama and high-intensity action, so a better Hulk movie really couldn't have been made and hasn't been made. This is THE Hulk movie to see and a first-class movie made on the basis of a comic book character. Though I didn't very much like Ang Lee's previous work (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) I couldn't help but feel that he was definitely the right man to helm this movie. He's definitely pulled it off in style, and I consider this his best work ever. I hope a sequel will be made, because such a great movie as this truly deserves at least one.

The Hulk is more than just a superhero movie, in fact, I'd like to think that it's NOT a superhero movie, I'll leave that to Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk - which is just dumb, loud entertainment. This is a story of suppressed emotions, freedom and the power to take our destinies into our own hands. As with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Lee explores the things that makes us prisoners of ourselves and what it takes to free us. In Crouching Tiger, the girl secretly practices martial arts, so when she winds up in the possession of a legendary warrior's sword she runs away and lives the life she always wanted to live. Her prison was tradition and arranged marriage, the sword represented her key to freedom. For the Hulk, Bruce Banner's prison is himself, all the repressed memories and trauma from his childhood, he's set free when an accident in his lab exposes him to gamma radiation, hence unleashing the true nature he never knew he had. The Hulk is the key to his freedom.

The Hulk jumping around like a grasshopper kept me from believing he's real, and is followed by his inconsistent movement. The acting isn't poor, but it's not great. And overall, the comic split screen becomes old very quickly, and continues through the film.

In general, I have been watching Marvel for a long time, I also watched individual films about each hero. The plot of the film is quite interesting and unusual, there is a gradual plot at a good pace.

Most of the actors in this film, I know, but precisely because of the roles of superheroes. The actors are good, they do an excellent job with their role, they get accustomed to it well. As far as I know, for the sake of such roles, actors have to train a lot and hard, as well as monitor their diet, and this is worth a lot. I would like to note the special effects of the film, they are simply gorgeous. Someone can put a negative film for the fact that there are a lot of computer graphics. Yes, this is true, but it's all so well implemented that I, on the contrary, consider it a feature of the film.

To me, as a person who has always been interested in such a topic as people with superpowers, what superpowers can be, etc. Etc. It was quite interesting to see this realization in the cinema.

As a result, I am completely satisfied with the film, I watched it like 3 times. Most of all, the film is certainly popular with young people, but adults sometimes like to watch such films. So I strongly recommend the film and wish you a pleasant viewing!",8.0,19 January 2022

...waist of my time...,"The Hulk had to be the most anticipated and most advertised movie I have ever laid my eyes on. You couldn't go anywhere and not see it. [i.e. local grocery, internet] I myself was not that anxious to see it, but after awhile I said what the hell. Oh man was that a mistake. This movie was a waist of my time! First off there is a lot of talking [a lot!]. Kind of like the first half hour of SPIDER-MAN, but this is half of the HULK. It was boring. I was wondering if there was even a monster in it at all. Even when the good scenes start it is hard to make out what he's doing. It is dark and the camera is so whack. Why can't the unique split-screen effects [you see plenty in the movie] come into play when the Hulk is in action. The scenes near the end are the only good ones, but they're so silly. In the animated series it actually looks like the Hulk is leaping at a great distance. Here he bounces like a little ball a couple of times and then floats for a long time. The only thing good about this film is [no not the story, it was lame too] the characters. The actors portray them very well and I was pretty shocked on how they pulled it off. Never the less this movie would of been a lot better if it had more 'Hulk', less laughable action scenes, and an occasionable laugh ever now and then to balance out the boredom. This is probably the worst comic book movie released. For 'real' Hulk action go back to the comic books.

RATING: 2/10",2.0,7 July 2003
"A confused, misshapen blob of a movie","I'm a big Ang Lee fan. The Ice Storm is one of my favorite movies. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was one of my favorite movies of that year. I even liked his Civil War ""flop"", Ride With the Devil.

I've seen enough of Lee's work that I knew that filming the Hulk was a big step outside his demonstrated areas of expertise, but I hoped that I'd at worst see something that was a competent genre movie, or, perhaps, a soft-focus, oblique recasting of the comic-book genre, which might be more in keeping with Lee's previous stylistic choices.

The Hulk is instead a complete mess. It is a movie that at times is not even competent, a purple prose disaster of bad acting, crappy writing, cheesy dialog, second-rate computer graphics and flabby editing, all set to a grating Danny Elfman score (is there any other kind?) that keeps you wandering to the bathroom for a breather.

Let's step back a minute, though: at the very least the Hulk's flaws are a breed apart from the usual idiotic, smart-alecky, low-brow routine that we are usually treated to when we go to an American action movie. Indeed, despite the fact that the Hulk is a pitiful concoction of a finished product, it would be fair to say that it is considerably less irritating to sit through than your typical Hollywood action film, which, while more professionally crafted in certain ways, is infinitely more predictable and more stupid than anything Lee has put up on the screen.

Put another way, The Hulk is so bad that it keeps surprising you with how bad it gets. It keeps you on your toes that way, keeps you thinking, keeps you asking yourself, ""what next?""

But there are some details that leap out at me as admirable.

Lee makes the Hulk into a bipolar maniac, by turns uncontrollably violent, at others sweet and melancholic. His Hulk is a descendent of the original Frankenstein, the mad scientist's creation who, unable to express with words the troubles that haunt his soul, instead expresses himself with bursts of action (violence). The animation provided of the Hulk's emotive features is occasionally quite compelling and sensitive.

Lee shows signs of developing a style of comic-book filmmaking that is the most direct tranlation of the comic book aesthetic to film from this emerging genre yet seen (unless you want to put forth the original television Batman with it's ""POW!""-style as the top of the class).

Lee frames the camera in extreme angles, pushing in on a face until the jaw and brow are cut off, in ways that directly mimic the expressionism of certain comic panels. He employs split-screen effects to suggest the layout of panels on a comic book page. At times you are even tempted to attribute the worst acting performances to an attempt to mimic a certain over-the-topness and two-dimensionality associated with comics.

The problem with Lee's approach is that it tugs in different directions: while there is a heavy element of visual style that is meant to give the movie the literal feel of a comic book, at other times the movie is extremely prosaic, carelessly photographed, and slumberingly paced. Some scenes are so low bugdet that they don't even quality as looking ""indie""; instead they look like a forgettable student film from a not-very-promising student.

Still, early in the movie there was some hope that Lee was actually trying to pull a weird hat trick: to juxtapose the heavily stylized comic-panel look with a gritty realism, sort of the opposite of your average Hollywood translation, which takes all the fantastic, slick action of a comic book, but scraps the extreme stylistic tics that demarcate that particular medium.

After a while, though, the movie reveals itself to be simply careless and poorly put together. The plot quickly unravels into an impenetrable, exploding mess (how complicated does a plot really need to be, anyway, when you're talking about comic book heroes?); the actors seem to modulate between two extreme states: fidgeting uncomfortably in front of the whirring camera, or eating the scenery with Wagnerian monologues; and soon the director is felt being dragged along by some unseen, clumsy force which is making his movie for him. Perhaps this movie is The Hulk's movie about Ang Lee, and not the other way around, you think, in which case, you wish the Hulk would have gone to film school.",3.0,20 June 2003

Weak,"The Hulk who hasn't crushed enough! The year was 2003, and the 'Era Heroic' of cinema was taking its first steps. After the successes of X-Men (2000) and Spider-Man (2002), it was only a matter of time before another character very present in the popular imagination also won his chance on the big screen. Therefore, in the wake of the success of his peers, the Hulk of Ang Lee appears. But, something went wrong ... what would have been? The computer-generated creatures that we are used to seeing in theaters have evolved a lot, and the Hulk that we have today with the Avengers 'convinces' in texture, expressions and movements. However, the CGI version of the anti-hero designed for his first foray into the big screen received harsh criticism, being considered too superficial, almost a cartoon. There were even those who compared him to the ogre Shrek (it was not for that)! And, if a film has a digital protagonist who is not convincing enough, the whole experience of watching it can be terribly compromised. Despite its visual aspect, however, the tone chosen for the feature also seems to have been wrong. Taiwanese director Ang Lee, known for his 'sensitive' works, wanted to give his character an authorial touch, and chose to delve deeply into Dr. Bruce Banner's psychological (played by Eric Bana) and his inner conflicts after the effects of radiation to which he was subjected (in this version) since childhood by his father (Nick Nolte), with whom he starts to maintain a turbulent relationship. The bombardment of gamma rays that affects him is only the trigger for something that has been latent for a long time to manifest. After a lot of suspense (and little action), when the Hulk finally appears on the scene - in this project that came to be called 'superhero art film' - almost an hour of projection has passed. What comes next is a series of tireless pursuits - in the midst of a melancholy desert - perpetrated by the army, under the leadership of General Ross (Sam Elliott), who sees the Hulk as a monster to be fought, and a focused dramatic outcome in the reckoning between father and son. Containing some bizarre things, like 'hulk-dogs' and the villain showing 'symptoms' of Absorbent Man, the plot still reserves space for the eternal parallel of the emerald giant with Beauty and the Beast, through the involvement between Banner and Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly), the general's daughter. The dense and intimate narrative, added to the contemplative and bucolic atmosphere, in addition to the peculiarities mentioned above, meant that the production did not please the large audiences. It is curious that these same aspects pointed out as defects, if seen from another angle, could be considered as qualities! But this intellectual approach was not what the audience expected, and Lee's film ended up falling into oblivion, especially since, just five years later, a new version was made, this time already inserted in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and with results ( a little) better, achieved with a more aggressive exploration of the ""Hulk smash"" style of the emerald giant. But that's another story.

The Uncredible Colorform,"If you can't stop laughing at the cartoonishly bad Hulk, you can't ever try and appreciate anything else done in the film. What to call it? A live action film with a colorform stuck to the lens comes to mind. It would have looked better with a SouthPark version of Hulk. They can't seem to keep a consistent size / scale to it as it interacts with the rest of the film setting and people. It doesn't have any depth or realism to its textures and the colors are freakishly bad. Have you ever seen a colorized western, where the dust of the cattle trail causes an un-natural glow to the 'assigned' skin and clothing colors? Well, Hulk looks worse than that. There's really no excuse for such a bad CGI job. The creature was the whole point of making the film (well, after making money anyways). They shouldn't have shot a single frame of film until they had a believable Hulk. Instead, they rushed a lame job with a novice-quality main character.",4.0,25 June 2003

"This movie blows, watch the trailers and be happy.","Warning: Take your Dramamine before watching this movie. I think Ang Lee was trying to give the movie a comic book feel with a lot of corny 1970's fades and slides and picture in a picture shots, but all he accomplished was to make this movie extremely painful to watch. That alone was not enough to kill this movie, but all of the lack of action was. They turned the Hulk into a wimp! Somehow they made a movie about a 15 foot ball of green testosterone into a some kind of cheesy chic flick about psycho-babble (i.e. psycho-babble, sins of the father, repressed memories...etc.). All of the good scenes are in the trailers; don't waste your money on the movie.",2.0,22 June 2003
Hulk good. Hulk smash plot.,"The main plot of the Hulk was a long, convoluted, multi-aspect mess. Genetic experiments, domestic violence, innocence, guilt, fear, remorse, regret, hatred, all wrapped up together into a big wad. The movie tried too hard and came up short.

The numerous frames and angles tried to create a comic book look is great for comic books, but did not look good on the big screen. Too many 'goofy' scenes wipes and too many *long* scenes. I don't need to see 10 minutes of helicopters flying over the desert to understand that I am watching helicopters flying over the desert.

Also, what was up with the Talbot character??!! This guy is so desperate to get the science research contract that he is portrayed as being a sadistic, uncaring person to a *ridiculous* degree. I mean, I understand this guy is greedy, but his maliciousness knows no bounds. He even goes so far as to pull weapons out of soldiers hands so that *he* can shoot at the Hulk AND he is physically confronting Bruce Banner while wearing 2-3 casts on various limbs AND a neck brace! I just thought that the writers went way over the top on this guy.

However, the scenes with the Hulk were excellent! I would say that the movie was worth watching just for watching the scenes with the Hulk alone. The Hulk was portrayed excellently; his look, his manner, all right out of the comics. His jumping, fighting and the fact that he did not cause a single death in the whole movie, despite millions of dollars in property damage was a great portrayal. The CGI effects were used to optimal effect to portray the green skinned goliath.

So, my final review: the movie overall 6/10. Just the scenes with the Hulk 10/10.",5.0,26 June 2003
You Won't Like Me When I'm Angry,"Therefore you will not like me after watching this film.

Ang Lee's apparent goal for this project was not to make a dull, drawn-out, overwrought mess of a film, but to do so in a random nonsensical and quite frankly ridiculous fashion.

A cure for insomnia, for certain, Hulk, the movie, had as many distractions from the ill-fated story line as it had poor visuals. The first 35 minutes of the film go nowhere slowly, then the rest is just a painful combination of a bad story and worse computer-generated animation.

Slowly tapping a spike into your forehead will undoubtedly be a preferred way to spend an evening.

The inner beast was released -- and sadly made it onto film and DVD.",1.0,25 November 2003
"Thank you, Ang Lee, thank you!","I'll openly admit that I was never a Hulk fan. It didn't seem the type of idea that could last through a series of comic books. I never watched the TV show because it always looked like a silly, bastardized version of the comic. But when the idea of a Hulk movie came out I was all for it.

I mean on the surface The Hulk seems like a fun movie idea like a minature Godzilla with a Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde complex, who the world treats like a modern-day Frankenstein. I didn't think about how Hulk is rage unleashed, that Bruce Banner has to battle in his brain to control the Hulk. Basically I didn't think about the psychology behind this superhero. But Ang Lee did, he thought about it and treated it with full seriousness. Instead of making an easy-breezy throw away film with a lot of smashing and bashing, that would seem like a bad monster film and would be forgotten within 20 minutes. Ang made a serious drama that focuses on characters effected by the Hulk events, with a few seriously delicious smashing and bashing sequences.

It's not like comic book films haven't been getting more serious, ""X-men"" opened up in the Holocaust, ""Daredevil"" showed the hero come home and pop painkillers, not to mention any Batman related TV show (during the 90's) always deals with the tragedy of Bruce Wayne's life. And this isn't the first film dealing with superheros with an extremely serious tone to it, I believe that title goes to M, Night Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"". This too is a film that focuses on the relationships and troubles of the characters, and that is what makes the film more intriguing.

The acting is supurb, Jennifer Conelly is top-notch, but you don't expect any less of her. Nick Nolte is excellent playing the crazy David Banner, almost to the point of being over-the-top. Eric Bana is the real hero here, he is a perfect Bruce, playing a mild-mannered scientist, who has a lot of repressed anger due to a childhood trauma.

Bruce Banner can be looked at as the person we are all forced to be in society, repressed. Our society wouldn't function if we all were allowed to unleash our anger in the form of The Hulk. Which brings me to Hulk, the finest CG performance I have ever seen. Ang Lee did the motion capturing himself, giving Hulk a really realistic performance. He did things, little things, that only angry people do. He had a harder performance to pull off because he doesn't say a word but his movements and reactions give off such an uncanny human quality and personality to them. As far as when Hulk is violent, it's BRUTAL, it's bone-cracking, gut pounding brutality, which is so good it's beautiful. Watching it is anger management. I was cheering when Hulk was smashing tanks, it was pure joy to watch.

The other thing I must praise is the editing, which not only gives the film a comic book feel, but a smooth transitioning flow, that keeps the eye moving and the brain active to soak up everything in this movie.

All in all I LOVED Hulk, I have always wanted to see comic book material taken seriously, and Ang Lee pulls it off with flair, putting it in my favorite comic book movies list. I recommend you go see it, I can't say that you'll completely like it, but I can tell you that you will have an opinion about it.",10.0,2 July 2003
"Without a good plot, and without a main character capable of making us care about.","There are characters from comic books who seem to be almost incapable of causing sympathy. Hulk is clearly one of them. Despite all the melodrama surrounding the character's life story, at least in this film (I'm not a comic fan to the point of knowing if the character's story is what the film tells us), this character is very chalk and little worked, unable to mess with my emotional side.

Basically, Hulk is the monstrous alter-ego of Bruce Banner, the son of a military scientist who made the mistake of doing genetic experiments on himself. It is an adaptation of the old story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, or at least it has immense similarities. Ang Lee, who assures the direction, did a decent job but lacked brightness and was never able to transform Bruce / Hulk into a character we can care about. The story seemed to me not very credible, not very interesting, very focused on the action scenes (as if the whole plot was just a pretext to see a green thug howling while crushing everything he finds) and with a very questionable ending.

As for the cast, I believe that Eric Bana did what he could with the material that was given to him but there was no way to shine. Sam Elliott is satisfactory, but unable to go beyond the cliché of the cold general who wants to use the tormented superhero as a weapon of war. Jennifer Connelly is perhaps even worse, as she is quite cold in her romantic feelings and the chemistry with Bana, quite simply, does not happen. Nick Nolte makes a good appearance, but in a character very accessory to the plot and absolutely hateful.

Technically, the film seems well done to me. It has a considerable budget and the money was clearly spent on carefully done action scenes, loaded with special effects and good quality CGI. Made to impress, they are the strongest part of the film. The point is that they need a good and firm story to give them the support they need. The photography was very well done, with a good job of filming, editing and post-production. The soundtrack, signed by Danny Elfman, does his job beautifully.

As with many other films based on comic books, this film was very well done and well thought out in the technical details but does not have a good story to tell. Without that, there is no film that can resist.",3.0,13 April 2020
Great But Not Great.,"I was expecting to really hate this film. Which is odd as I usually go into movies with an open mind. But I was thinking, how can Ang Lee, who brilliantly directed a Jane Austen adaptation, make a great Action Film. So biased...

I'm not going to say much except that it was hella better than any comic book movie I've seen. The action scenes aren't as plentiful as you might think, but when they're present they're great.

There's a lot of dialogue and a ton of buildup. Instead of just letting this be a 100 percent action film Lee sprinkles it with the wonderful performances from Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly.

The bad-dad sub plot thing is kind of annoying though. The ending is p*** poor and it's long. I came out of the theatre realizing half my afternoon was gone. But I would surely recommend this to anyone. 7.5/10",,22 July 2003

Made Me Angry,"Every now and then, maybe once in a cinematic generation, a film comes along directed by someone who is considered beyond the source material he is working with, OR someone who is the polar opposite of the genre of the movie. This nearly always causes a buzz from fans and the entertainment industry prior to the movies release then slating from film critics upon its release. Good examples of this would be David Lynch's Dune (1984) and Sir Ridley Scott's Robin Hood (2010). It is very true of Ang Lee's Hulk as well. For various different reasons the movie simply fails to deliver a movie that audiences across the board enjoyed, and it is fair to say this is because Ang Lee gets it wrong on many levels. The Incredible Hulk is my favourite superhero and comic book title, i was weaned on the 1982 Animated Series and the excellent, classic Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno starring live action TV series. As a comic book reader i cut my teeth with Peter David's Hulk titles. Ang Lee fails to deliver a movie that has any of the enjoying factors of any of the above, he gives us a clunky, clattering and clumsy over long look at the world of Bruce Banner and The Hulk. The pace never picks up and the characters and their worlds are boring. Part of the problem is with the casting of Eric Bana as Bruce Banner, Lee makes the character such an alien and unaproachable freak that it is hard for anyone watching to relate to him or identify with the character. Lee undoubtedly got it wrong but Banas performance also lacks the charisma and qualities of say Christopher Reeve as Superman, the freakish nature of Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne/Batman or the every man qualities of Bill Bixby's David Banner, all of these performances prove what is capable in genre acting so there can be no excuses. The tone of the supporting cast performances are uneven to say the least, Josh Lucas is put in a horrible situation not knowing whether to perform Talbot as over the top sneering villain or pantomime camp. Nick Nolte is miscast as Banners father and delivers a truly odd performance that gives the impression he just wondered in undressed, under groomed after a night on cocaine from the actors studio. The biggest problem though lies fairly and squarely with the unconvincing and poorly realised special effects, none of which look convincing and look like proto types, and this is a huge problem : The character of The Hulk himself is a CGI realised effect that went badly BADLY wrong, not only is the design of Hulk poor (he looks like Shrek's angry steroid pumped uncle!), it leaves the film with a sense of anti climax following his first appearances and subsequent metamorphis. Also it is impossible to relate and identify with a CGI monstrosity such as this when it goes right,when it goes wrong it is even more so and you just don't believe in The Hulk here in the same way as you would do with a credible acting performance or the way you did do with Lou Ferrigno. Praise must be given for at least attempting to produce something bold but the finished result has nothing commendable. Hulk never manages to echo the greatness of the comics and subsequent versions of the character, Bana doesn't come any where near to matching the magic of Bill Bixby, and Ang Lee's movie, with its slow pace, lumbersome heavy handedness and over seriousness fails in a big way to offer up an entertaining piece of cinema.",4.0,17 October 2010

I was just about to think 'perhaps this will be pretty good,' when we were suddenly thrown into 40 minutes of confusing, overblown and disjointed plot. That really summarises the film as a whole. The action sequences were pretty good, building up a tempo, yet suddenly they were interrupted or cut with horrible multi-screen cinematics. The last 20 minutes of the film, are quite possibly the most frustrating moments of my life. The plot spiralled completely out of control and i found myself leaking brain matter everywhere.

The Comic Book Comes to Life,"I'm reading all of these negative reviews about The Hulk, and I don't understand what type of movie these people thought they were going to see? This is not some art-house film. This is not ""The Ice Storm"" or ""Sense and Sensibility.""

This is The Hulk. The Incredible Hulk. A character featured in a comic book which has lasted over 40 years. And this movie does the comic book, and all of its true fans, justice.

I think people believe that they were going to see 2 hours and 18 minutes of the Hulk running around and smashing everything in sight. Of course, that's what the movie could have been--and it would have been boring and overdone after the first 30 minutes.

No, what Ang Lee and his crew has given us is a tragic story--paced out like a real-life event. A child loses his parents and the sins of his father have been passed onto him without his knowledge or consent. His world has never been normal and now, due to an accident, his life has just went up 1000 points on the abnormal scale.

Anyone who complains about the split-screen and the comic book look is just complaining a little too much. . .it doesn't happen much, but when it does it looks really cool. These are probably the same people who didn't like ""The Matrix Reloaded"" because Neo ""fights too fast"". . .Lee is just trying to do something cool here and people are reaching out too hard to find something wrong with this picture (or condemning something different--just like the Hulk is condemned because he is different).

No, this is not Spider-Man. . .this is a different character. . .not a geeky teenager bitten by a radioactive spider, but a man afflicted with with a hidden terror that takes physical form.

Everyone whining and crying about how the movie is a fantasy--give me a break. . .it's the Hulk! Not Othello. Not Schindler's List. Don't get me wrong--there is a plot. The dialogue is fine. There is a good story. And then the Hulk smashes!!

Ang Lee directed a great film. Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly did a great job (plus Nick Nolte, Sam Elliott and the rest of the cast). The Hulk looked fantastic. (Enough already with ""the Hulk looks like the Jolly Green Giant"" dribble). In the comics, the Hulk is really huge--and not the size of Lou Ferrigno (though Lou was cool). The fight scenes with the gamma-dogs and the Army was great.

I just saw a 50-year-old man jump out of his seat and yell like a little kid--he was extremely happy because the child inside of him finally was seeing what he had read so many years ago in a magazine--the Hulk was alive and showing his unstoppable might.

People who believe the Hulk story is just a drama about a man who turns into a 15-foot green beast when he gets angry only know half of the tale. There is much more to the Hulk mythos (including character development and emotions), and this movie covers all of those bases (and then gives you some big time action).

This movie gets 3 thumbs up! Great visuals. Interesting story. Great and innovative CGI. And the silver screen debut of Green Goliath. I cannot wait for the sequel. I want more Hulk!",,21 June 2003
Too long and chock full of little annoying things which frustrate the hell out of you.,"'Hulk' is another film that tries to cash in on the influx of comic adaptations that are being/were made at the time of release. What's also rather interesting is that it was directed by Ang Lee, of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' fame. This is quite the opposite film though; visually, in terms of aesthetics and overall, in terms of quality.

When I watched this, it was on a Sunday afternoon and I thought I'd watch it fairly relaxed but the frustration I felt whilst watching this has lead me to say the things I'm going to say.

Although I liked the 'nod' to comic books themselves via the split screen and various other transitions contained throughout the beginning, too much of one thing can become rather annoying and this is the case. What's significant is the fact it's the same with the entire film, not just the opening, gimmicky segment of effects. They become distracting, annoying and what it is we're looking at becomes insignificant as the visuals pane away, playing second fiddle to the hypnotic music and the erratic transitions unfolding. Once the film starts, we're lead to believe that Banner (Bana) and Ross (Connelly) have shared some sort of history as the actual film and character relations get the ball rolling but I couldn't see anything between them and in terms of plot and past happenings, we're never really told anything about them until it's too late. In fact, we're about forty-five minutes into the film when we learn something coincidental that happened during their childhoods.

What was really frustrating with the film were the montages that occur far too frequently throughout. They consist of experiments and various other things involving chemistry equipment and we're 'treated' with loads of numbers and figures as all this is happening. I thought these felt insignificant and needlessly bulked up the run time. They were slow, went on for too long and really, I was just left asking myself: 'Why am I seeing this?' These little montages happen at various points before the initial incident. This actually brings me onto the occurrence where Banner in exposed to become the Hulk in the first place. It seems to take absolutely ages to arrive and when it does, it's rather disappointing as it just 'happens' and then relies on cheese and a bad script from Connelly's character to hit home a 'I thought I was going to watch you die(!)' quote. The reason this is bad is because we don't yet know if she even cares for him. We don't even know HOW they know one another.

When it comes to the detective work of the film, what really made me chuckle is that an age after the initial incident of exposure, the characters only start to suspect something's wrong with Banner (No, really? He was exposed to radiation after all) and begin to foil the problem. They work it out fine which is harmless enough but it's not suspenseful nor that interesting because for the characters, it's a revelation  for us; it's already known knowledge; we've known what the characters are working out and talking about for the last hour and is just pointless confirming. It's like tapping in 2+2 into a calculator; you know what the answer's going to be but you're double checking anyway.

With comic book films there's bound to be computer generated images involved and although the CGI isn't too distracting; as it's slick and there's enough of it to keep a consistency going, there are no other good things going for Hulk which keeps it down to a mediocre rating.",5.0,14 December 2006
BLAH,"umm this movie was pretty awful. It was ok at first, but the animation was horrible, and then they kept the movie going when they should have stopped. It wasnt very entertaining, and was too long. Jennifer Connely is so much better than this crap. sorry but it sucked",2.0,1 July 2003
Big fat dumb green movie,"Okay... not every good movie HAS to be an origin story. I'm almost getting sick to death of the origin story. I'd rather see the movie that makes the origin a mystery... the way Star Wars did back in the old days. Just jump right in the action. Do we really need to see JAWS as a tuna? How he swam and learned to eat his first seal. No thanks. Indiana Jones waited till the third film and a TV series before we got an inkling of how Indy picked up that whip and got so `fraid `o snakes. As much as I wasn't the biggest fan of Spiderman, they did do the origin bit justice and they didn't make it feel so dragged out. With The Hulk we are not so lucky. I mean, Ang Lee goes crazy with the flashbacks and while its innovative editing has some fantastic ideas, it eventually steals from the drama. But don't blame the actors. They were good. It's the writers who should be locked in a room with the Hulk dogs. Man... they just blah, blah, blah the movie into one gigantic bore. It's funny because one would think that you'd have more trouble with a movie like X-Men where there are a ton of characters, but this flick, which basically has five roles... They saturate the story with more psycho-babble than the Matrix... and this time, it's unintelligible psycho-babble. There is no truth in what the people are saying and feeling. It's like the worst comic book writing you've ever read. The five people are stretched so thin, that each turns out to barely be one-dimensional. Ultimately, they would have been better off beginning the movie where it ends... the guy you don't know too much about, who rights all these wrongs... and then we learn who he is... basically the TV show. Yeah. They should have pulled a Charlie's Angels. Oh, and I have to mention the title credits. If I see one more f***ing DNA sequence ala X-Men, Spiderman, you name it... can't we be original? They're all basically ripping off Fight Club at the end of the day anyway. I will say this about the special effects. They were good, but I am sad to report that there is something just a little too synthetic about the big green guy. It's not as bad as Jar Jar Binks... but he ain't no Gollum either. And I was up for the challenge of accepting the idea to make the guy more than an actor in face paint, but eventually, I think I am going to fall victim to the belief that it may have actually been the better way to go. There's no empathy. His fight scenes are great. But movies need to be more than just fight scenes. They need wit and believable situations. The characters need charm. They need magic. This movie lacked that magic. Its not the worse film I've ever seen, however I can't remember being more disappointed. Grade: C",3.0,20 June 2003
You're all wrong and I;m right,"I haven't seen a single positive review for this film, and I know the reason. The reason is that everyone who has seen it is a cretin except me.

This is the first film to fully capture (or even to attempt to capture) the passion, artistry and narrative structure of the comic book art form. It succeeds because director Ang Lee cinematically translates the process of reading a comic; at instances where the reader would pause to take in the artistry and emotion of the scene, he slows the film down and repeats the same images for us; where a comic book would show different view points within the same frame, he does likewise. And where adrenaline pumped action is the order of the day, Ang Lee gleefully seems to skip through some images as a reader would quickly scan a page to see if the hero wins through. Towards the end he does break free from the comic book, but only to provide Nolte an opportunity to revel in theatre soliloquy.

Every performance in this film is superb - including the CGI ones. Sam Elliot relishes the opportunity to do more than smile under his moustache for once.

Ignore the reviewers who reviewed this film expecting Spiderman or X-Men. With every one of his recent films Ang Lee looks at the fantastic movies that proceeded him in that genre and then asks - what were they ACTUALLY trying to do, and how can I achieve what they wanted to do but didn't. Sense and Sensibility for the Period Drama, Ride with the Devil for the western... Hulk for the comic book movie.",10.0,2 September 2006
"Terrible, terrible, terrible","Though I have not seen ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" (I have no intention of doing so), I feel quite assured that ""Hulk"" is the single worst summer film of 2003, as well as one of the worst films of 2003.

In ""The Hulk,"" wait, no, just ""Hulk"" (the film is apparently too much of an 'event' to have a prefix) dull, tight-lipped Cal scientist Bruce Banner refuses to talk to ex-girlfriend Jeniffer Connelly (who plays the same role she won the Oscar for, but who also is made to look slightly ridiculous in doing so by the silly premise of the film) about his real feelings or whatever. The two grow closer as the film progresses, the comic backstory is ultimatley releaved, and the Hulk smashes a great deal of military hardware. Sounds fine on paper, but the film has problems, and quite a few of them at that.

The presentation of the plot and backstory of the film is needlessly convoluted--not that it is difficult to decipher or guilefully woven into the fabric of the film's timeline, its's just presented in gratuitious flashbacks and uninspired, cliche dialogue.

And while the film means to slowly build up to its climax (where the infamous Hulk does indeed 'smash' a great deal) in a lengthy early segment, it ultimatley looses the audience's interest as opposed to creating anticipation.

Moreover, Seeing a taciturn Berkeley scientist's internal struggles is just uninteresting--no one who likes the Hulk likes him (or it) because of its/his Bruce Banner side (the film's called ""Hulk,"" not ""Bruce"").

And while the film's focus may be detracting, seeing what looks Gumby on steriods and speed trying to pass himself off as the Hulk is just outright dissapointing. The special effects look remarkably artificial given the status of the film, and there is absolutley no realistic sense of gravity or momentum. While other comic book movies have adapted the famous garb of superheroes to fit contemporary tastes (hence, Wolverine in X-Men does not wear a degrading neon yellow spandex jumpsuit), ""Hulk"" is apparently too cool for school in this regard. The Hulk is, just like in the comics, bright green and adorned in magic purple shorts; this just looks unnatural and overly-cartoony.

And finally, the end of the film is little more than a set-up for a sequel. This not only offsets the pace of the film, but also seems EXTREMELY presumptious on the part of those involved, especially considering a sequel will probably never be made given the film's modest box-office intake.

As you can tell, I really, really did not enjoy this film. It is melodramatic, redundant, unenvenly paced, and unfullfilling. I encourage all who reads this to skip this fruitless cash-cow save the $8.75.",2.0,19 July 2003
Hulk is so amazing for me,I mean wow every childs dream character the Hulk the unstoppable hulk push and pee of the man banner and he will just turn in to a super powerful unstoppable green monster that can not be matched. I ve been watching hulk for years the TV series and the cartoons are classics. But this movie Hulk has a great story line with some real solid effects and fight scenes that just blew me away and i hope it will blow away any one that watches it. Films some times take some time to get into this one starts of on a steady pace and the audience watching it cant wait to see hulk on screen but when hulk appears wow its amazing to watch him in action i love it when he runs at you Roar Ahhhh LOL its scary he looks so mean and angry. I know for sure that Hulk fans will definitely enjoy this Solid movie thanks,,27 October 2013

Sell Your MVL Stock Monday Morning: Hulk is a Disaster,"Saw the Hulk Friday Night and in all honesty I don't believe I have ever seen a less entertaining movie. How one director could take such a talented cast and do so little with it is beyond me. The movie is totally devoid of any humor, although I could not help laughing during Nicks last rambling pointless speech. Spiderman, X Men, X 2, both Blades, all had at least a little humor in them. If your one of those people that have found the hidden inter-spiritual meaning of the movie, tune into CBNC Monday morning and watch what those un-enlightened normal people do to Marvel stock. I suspected Hulk was a disaster when Lee was quoted as saying ""I really like the movie. I am not sure what others will think but it meant a great deal to me, and they cannot take that away"". when you hear that type of sentimental horse---- you know your in trouble. By the way before this nightmare is over for Marvel they be giving away those Hulk Hands if you will pay for the shipping. HULK IS A DISASTER. herb007",1.0,21 June 2003
Worst movie of the year,"I am a big 'Incredible Hulk' fan when I was a kid. I have never miss an episode. This new movie is a big disappointment. First, the story line is teribble. Who in the world can think of such a 'low grade' story ? Even the comic has a better story to tell. And all the 'Great Scene' in the movie has already been played on the trailer. There are no reason to watch this movie at all.",1.0,19 June 2003
Not what you expect,"Not necessarily the lowbrow bubblegum movie you'd expect, the Hulk is instead a movie with substance and content. Hulk is not rampaging across a city in the first ten minutes, and any whiny child expecting that is going to disappoint themselves. The pacing is more similar to that of the original Superman movie.

Hulk has a message, and is not a movie I felt like I had seen before.

Of particular note, this movie sets a benchmark in scene transitions. Combining these with multi-panel images (similar but developed from those of '24'), any viewer is in for a visual feast.",10.0,2 October 2003
All the Hulk had to do...,"...was smoke a joint. Seriously, Mr. Banner, Mr. Bruce Banner and his hundreds of antagonists, instead of forcing this monster to undergo so much stress related tests and anxiety -- what you should have done was roll him a joint and smoke it. Hell, Mr. Ross, Betty, the Hulk's Father should smoke one too. I wish Ang Lee smoked one, then maybe he would have sat down, chilled, and thought this one out before he signed on the dotted line. The many screenwriters on this project (doesn't surprise me that there were so many, money-gobbling films like this tend to undergo as many rewrites as physically possible until one draft contains enough dialogue and irrelevant action to make you cringe) -- well the writers probably smoked a whole once every morning before they pulled up a seat to their PC's. That would explain the reluctance to focus on one topic.

Look, of all the Comic books movies out right now, this one is the most stylized. But style does not make this worth seeing. Nor does its great cast. It suffers from a lack of integrity. It condescends to its audience by repeating facts over and over again, it disguises back story as essential to understanding this opus. Too many damn antagonists for one (or two) protagonists, and with an inciting incident that comes 30 minutes in, you wonder why it was so necessary to take two-and-a-quarter hours to explain the story. Not too mention the fact that the excess use of flashbacks will have your eyes rolling so far back, you're going to see white.

The last twenty-minutes are so laughable, so inconveniently placed to set up a sequel, you will wonder -- why not use that footage as part of the sequel. But that would probably make the next Hulk 3 hours long, and god forbid they ever do that to the public. 145 minutes as long enough.

This film had potential, as do all the comic book films of this year (excluding LXG). I mean look at X-Men (and X-2) they are great simply because they merge great story with great storytelling.

Not as exciting as expected,"A strong supporting cast that featured a lot of my favorite actors over the years (Connelly, Elliott, Nolte) could not hold my interest in this movie. The special effects, on the other hand, did!

The split screen images that would show all the people/things affected by the events happening in the movie were good. And I understand the need to set the plot up by showing the movie as they did, but, overall, if you are going to see this movie to watch the Hulk smash things, prepared to be bored for the first half of the film. I used to collect Marvel comics as a kid and this was one of them. For the Hulk to span the ages and enter the new millenium as it did was wonderful. But, overall, I think this movie was a dud.

Bad,"The Hulk was not a near perfect film. In the begining, it felt like it skipped order. Another feature I did not like was the split screen. During just about all the actions sequences, there was a little picture in the corner of the screen which made it difficult to concentrate on both. There was way to much science involved with it too. The action scenes were also not realistic. The story and plot were horrible, and so was the villian. Also this move was way too long, 2 hours 10 minutes apprx. My rating 3",3.0,20 June 2003
Better than the trailers suggest,"Overall, liked the movie. As one of the other reviewers noted, any movie with Jennifer Connelly is a good one. The trailers made the Hulk character look far worse than the actual movie.

The movie splits the screen at different times to simulate a comic book, which can be somewhat disconcerting. The split was a very effective device about 50% of the time.

Eric Bana did a good job as Bruce Banner, and his portrayal came off well. Sam Johnson as Thunderbolt Ross was awesome. However, when Nick Nolte appears, I spent more time thinking about how time has

not been kind.

The only real critique I can make is that this is not a kids movie. Many of the sequences are too disturbing and inappropriate for the under 17 crowd. This is, unfortunately, a habit that ruins a lot of movies that I have seen lately.

Overall, I give this movie a ""7"".",,20 June 2003
Bad decisions all around,"Im probably biased. I just don't see this character. Its just too much. He gets mad and he transforms into a monster. There is little to do, honestly. Maybe if they change the character, maybe if Bruce Banner was violent as a human. A total prick and bully with people but for what he believed were ""good reasons"". Then after the experiment, everytime he lets his rage takes him, people get hurt. When he gains consciousness back, he sees the destruction he produced. Then the movie is about him trying to escape from the Army that wants him as weapon, and him trying to be a better person and don't get mad at everything, because: he knows what happens if he does; because he realizes he was always bullyng people.

And even then, although smarter, it sounds boring.

And that's what this movie is: Boring + Dumb. Lethal combination. If you put these two together with horrendous visuals/graphics/effects, and lame acting. The result is this atrocity.",1.0,24 August 2018
A daily comment from Midget Emma: Hulk (2003),"A very slow movie. The Hulk is not what i expected. It was slow and the Hulk leaps around like he is off Crouching Tiger, hidden dragon but it had great acting and a strong story.

The Hulk was very impressive. He looked so real. Much more real then he looked in the 2008 version. The story focuses so much on the Hulk. We get a very detailed back story and by the end of the movie it feels like we know him.

Eric Bana was good as Bruce Banner. But enough about him lets get to the real star of the show. Nick Nolte was excellent. He out shined everyone involved.

I recommend it if you like the Hulk or comic book movies. It was a solid but boring movie.

I thought Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte did an awesome job in their rolls. Eric and Jennifer were also good. When I saw the Hulk Shrek did come to mind, it may be because they are both green and have the same size ears.

Too ambitious for its own good,"Great special effects, spectacular action scenes and innovative editing are bogged down in a swamp of over-written character study and operatic angst. Schizophrenic is probably the best word to describe this movie (as well as the central character.)

The movie captures the look, but not the feel of the old comic books. Hulk was always a sad and tragic character, but the comic books were action first and psycho-drama second. This movie turns that formula upside-down and this is why it upset so many summer action fans, as well as the legions of comic book fans who flocked to its opening weekend (the film did a quick nose-dive at the box office once the word got out that this was not the next Spider-man.)

SIDE NOTE: Outraged fans should prepare to be upset further as a sequel is already in the works. These days Hollywood seems to make a sequel to even the most moderate hits (see also ""Jeepers Creepers"", ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Dr. Doolittle"", etc.), despite the public outcry and predictable crash-and-burn results of such endeavors. What's next? Wild, Wild West 2? Blair Witch 3? If they announce either of these, I will personally be rooting for Mother Nature and the San Andreas fault to make good on their decades-old threat to dump Hollywood into the sea (perhaps a new and more creative species of movie executives will emerge on the new coastline.)",,1 March 2004
A missed opportunity,"My impression of Hulk can best be summed up in two words: missed opportunity. This was a chance to tell the origin story of one of Marvel's most popular comic book characters, but instead we get a very talky and slow film about the estrangment of children from their parents. This film is no Spider-Man or X-Men (or X2 for that matter). It doesn't try to be, and I think therein lies the problem.

When I heard Ang Lee was directing Hulk, I thought it was a strange choice. Lee was the director of the excellent Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and probably the seminal period-piece chick-flick of all time, Sense and Sensibility. But because it was such an odd choice, I thought it could be something exciting and different. The result, in my opinion, was definitely different, but by no means exciting.

The massive amounts of promotional ads and trailers for the film show us a glimpse of the movie that Hulk should've been -- scenes of the Hulk facing off against the military, the Hulk battling mutant dogs, and the Hulk pounding through the big city. And to be fair, we do get those scenes in this film and they are quite good. The problem lies between these action sequences, where we get scene after scene of tedious and sometimes silly exposition with actors who really don't seem to be interested. I found nothing special about Eric Bana, the actor who portrays Bruce Banner. He stares blankly through most of the picture, only emoting just before his transformation scenes. Jennifer Connelly seems equally bored, and shares little chemistry with Bana, her love interest in the movie. Josh Lucas plays Talbot, a limp and ineffective villain who is about as threatening as an accountant. Veterans Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte overact their way through most of their scenes, adding some spice to an otherwise boring cast.

My favorite part of this movie suprised me: it was the Hulk himself. What I had seen of the Hulk in the promotional materials hadn't really impressed me much. I thought the Hulk looked pretty fake, but I hoped he would work in the context of the movie. Fortunately he does. The only time the film comes alive is when the Hulk is smashing his way through one situation or another. He looks more realistic in closeups than the long shots though. In this era of excellent CG creations like Yoda and Gollum, it seems like the Hulk is a step backwards, but his presence in this otherwise stale film is most welcome.

The reason this movie will fail at the box office is because it's just no fun. I can't imagine the target audience of this movie lining up multiple times to see Nick Notle and Eric Bana discuss Bruce Banner's troubled childhood in endless scenes. Ang Lee set out to make a ""serious"" film about a subject which demands you cannot be too serious. The result is a failure. However, the one scene that is pitch-perfect is the last scene in the film. It actually put a big smile on my face just before the lights came up, and made me forget briefly that I hadn't enjoyed myself for the past 2 1/2 hours. It had that fun magic that the rest of the film lacked. If there is a sequel, I hope whoever is at the helm can capture that spark and make a Hulk movie people will actually want to see again.

The biggest,"Issue with this version of hulk movie is that it casted A listers with dramatic pedigree. Moreover, the cast are too attractive for the roles that they tried really hard to be nerds and less attractive that it wasn't genuine. Gave this movie another try since I didn't think highly of it when it was released. I was right then, I just didn't know how to express a critical view then. For a modern movie, the pacing is too slow that I happen to look at the run time which was at 39 min when I realized I haven't seen any action. I must give credit when it is due. This film pre date mega budget super block buster franchise, and it managed well with a story line that would run circles around comic book movie thereafter. This film probably catered to comic book nerds that followed the character closely that it neglected the general audience. I couldn't finish the film in one sitting hence the 3/10 star rating.",3.0,6 April 2024
Boring Film,"The action was terrible and the Hulk looked like a cartoon. The split screens were very distracting and Ang Lee didn't succeed in making it look like a cartoon, even though he tried.

To top it all off, the movie was too long at more than 2 hrs. For summer entertainment, this is pretty poor stuff.",1.0,22 June 2003
A truly underrated film,"Im really surprised that this movie is heavily criticized. I though this movie was fantastic. The acting was solid, the story was great, the action and effects were well done, and Ang Lee captured the emotion of the Hulk most superhero/comic book movies lack these days.

Thats not to say there were some flaws in this film. My main problem is the plot goes a bit slow in some places, but not the places that people criticize the most.

Most people hated this movie because its not a "" smash and bash"" big action movie it was marketed as. But I see the movie in the way its supposed to be made: About the personality of the Hulk, and not the ""smashing and bashing"" people wanted to see. The people who wanted to see that movie would have to wait 5 years before one came out ( the 2008 Incredible Hulk)

Overall, an excellent movie, over criticized, underrated and disappointed they didn't make a sequel to this great film. ( i would have preferred a sequel over the 2008 reboot)

Hulk was wasted potential,"The movie has an uninteresting story with some terrible CGI. The cut style was a very good idea, but it was way to overused. The characters were boring and uninteresting. Some scenes were done good though.",2.0,5 June 2021
The closest to the comic that you can get....,"For those who complain about the movie being slow, and as one review put it, ""talky,"" then you never read the book. Hulk comics aren't about Hulk smashing stuff on every panel. It's about a man on the run, hunted and hounded by those who fear and despise him, in both of his guises.

I love how Ang Lee brought this movie to life. Lee is an obvious fan of the Hulk, and his love of the character is apparent in the film. There wasn't a single moment that I thought to myself ""that's not what Hulk is about."" The initial tweaking to the origin of the Hulk is fine by me, since all movies seem to do that nowadays with comics. But it made more sense in this form than the original, bringing it to the genetic level, than just a simple bomb going off (though I do like that the bomb is still present.)

The action was awesome, but the story was even better, showing a classic Frankenstein story about the outcome of experimenting with forces out of our control. If you are one who was bored with the movie, then I recommend Van Damme movies that are all action and no story. Hulk moves at the same pace as the comic book does, with the same balance of drama and action.

Eric Bana was a great choice for Banner, and I loved the cgi on Hulk. It was realistic enough to fit into the film, and it stayed consistent in its style and how well it was integrated in with the actors and environment.

Worth a watch, and even more. This will be a DVD purchase.

Nothing Incredible About This,"Hulk(2003) Review: Hulk. Superheroes are quite the trend. Some were good, others.....not so good. Hulk is not a superhero movie. This is more of a monster movie...like King Kong.

Hulk. This is a very boring movie. There are many problems here. The directing is silly. Ang Lee is trying the comic book touch and it's just too cheesy too look at. The FX are so unrealistic. Hulk looks too damn silly. When Hulk transforms, why does his pants remain intact?

This movie could have been a really good character study on Bruce Banner/Hulk. Unlike Batman Begins, Hulk fails to be compelling at all. Hulk just suffers from boredom. Also, when Banner says,""You won't like me when I'm angry."" is poorly delivered. Maybe a better phrase would be,""Don't screw with me buddy."" Don't get me started on Nick Nolte. He looks just as bad as the famous mug shot here. His acting was rather bad too. The only good acting here was Sam Elliot. Hulk just fails to deliver the goods.

The CGI was pretty terrible as well, and that's all I really went to go see. The protagonist was a lifeless character whos flacid acting and terrible voice did nothing to move the movie forward.

The worst comic book incarnation yet!,"The overall 'look' of the film reminds me of an episode of 24 will all of the split screen aspects. I would of thought Ang Lee could come up with something better than that for such a big budget feature film.

The C.G.I. of The Hulk character is pathetic, two of the major scenes with The Hulk in it are in almost complete darkness (probable to cover up such crap animation).

The acting is pretty wooden throughout, but I guess that's to be expected when you act mostly with a blue screen. Overall this is a bad film as any film goes... script, screenplay, acting, special effects and directing are all pointless and ineffective. I cannot believe Stan Lee would put his name to this!",1.0,12 July 2003
Nolte Power...(8 out of 10),"I think this was better than expected. I was upset at the trailers for this film. However, I have learned many times over not to judge a movie by it's trailer. Especially in the case of the movie ""Any Given Sunday"". I thought the trailer for that looked great. The movie itself is the worst I have ever seen. It is also 3 hours of your life wasted if you watch it. Now back to Hulk. Hulk was entertaining. It should have featured more Nick Nolte. His character was the best part of the film. I hope that they didn't really kill him off in case there is a sequel. Which all depends on the profit. Yep... Once again (8 out of 10).",8.0,8 November 2003
The Hulk tries too hard,"I went to this movie expecting the raw emotion of the hulk to really pull the audience in, to make us feel for him, to make us get angry along with him. What I got was a lot of characters yelling, crying, and trying very hard to appear emotional, but coming off forced and unconvincing. The bonds between the characters, and more importantly the bonds between the characters and the audience, were not developed well enough to ever make these emotional outbursts very motivating. Perhaps it would have helped if the beginning of the movie had focused less on just telling us the back story and more on building the characters in the present, letting the audience become clued in to their history as the movie progressed.

The action scenes suffer from a similar problem. Some were good, but for the most part, they were uninteresting despite the over-the-top action. It seems that the creators were unable to make the action more subtly interesting, so they just made it bigger and wilder. Unfortunately, boring action made bigger is still boring action.

The comic style scene cuts were interesting but overdone. Not every scene needs a fancy cut. Eventually the strange cuts just became repetitive. It looked more like someone playing with new audio-video equipment than someone seriously making a movie. They should have focused on making excellent comic style cuts at key scenes instead of making mediocre attempts at it throughout the whole movie.

All in all, ""The Hulk"" is not a bad movie. It is, however, a movie that lacks subtlety and tries too hard to make up for it with quantity and extremity.",5.0,23 June 2003
GRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!! HULK SMASH!!!!!!!,"The wait is finally over! THE HULK has hit the theaters! Compared to the TV version of The Hulk, this movie version ROCKS. Ang Lee has really outdid himself with this movie, making a computer-generated hulk was awesome. My favorite part is when the Hulk threw the tank like a hammer throw in the Olympics. Eric Bana was awesome playing the role of Dr. Bruce Banner. He really does fit that role perfectly. Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross was awesome too. The perfect Alias! Sam Elliot as Gen. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross is definetely a perfect choice, because he does have the attitude of the comic book character. Nick Nolte as Dr. Banner is a big comeback for him! He's not bad! For a bad DAD!

I was very disappointed with the first Hulk movie.,"The editing for the split screen sequences creating a comic book come to life was very cool. I also liked the CGI of the Hulk, but unfortunately, he wasn't in it very much. For a two and a half hour movie, he was on screen for about 20 minutes. It wasn't even about the Hulk. Bruce Banner (the alter ego) was looking for his long lost father mostly and was a scientist. The other characters were very flat and had no personality. There was way too much talk and the conversations weren't memorable either. I don't know the history of the Hulk character, but it didn't seem like the filmmakers did either. This reminds me of my disappointment with the early Batman movies from Tim Burton for not having much to do with Batman. The 2008 Hulk version was much better.",5.0,28 April 2024
Hulk was bomb!,"I couldn't stand this movie. I went to the movie thinking I was going to see a beauty and beast film with Sam Elliot and the army trying to kill the Hulk, but the film was filled with so many subplots and scenes that made no sense it just became boring and confusing. Add to that Ang Lee split screens during the film. Some will think it cool and looks like a comic book, others will thinks its artistic, but during major scenes where the screen is cut into 4 pieces and action is taking in all areas which do you watch. I only have one pair of eyes. The only saving grace for this movie is the acting Connelly and Elliot and terrific as a strained father and daughter.",2.0,5 July 2003
Very Bad Movie,"The Hulk is one of my favorite comic book characters, and I have always felt that Ang Lee is an excellent director. Despite these two prejudices, I felt that ""The Hulk"" was a terrible, dull, nonsensical movie.

I thought that all the principles (except possibly for Nolte) were stiff and wooden in their acting. The movie endeavored to have a quiet, and a brooding atmosphere, but, instead, was just really dull. The lead up to his transformation into the Hulk was slow and dreary. I'm probably one of the few who wasn't really bothered by the CGI (which many thought was substandard), but I never got much of a sense of empathy for the monster.

Then, at the end, there is a confrontation between Banner/Hulk and his nemesis, which just plain does not make any logical sense.

I imagine that they were trying to make this film into a super-hero/psychological horror film, but it just didn't work. It was too slow, and the scenes which were meant to draw out suspense just made things more dull.",3.0,24 November 2009
Best comic adaptation ever made,"Hulk is not only a superhero movie but also an Ang Lee's movie. That's the most important difference between this movie and other superhero movies.

The plot may appear not too brilliant, but the direction is great and original with an interesting use of split screen and digital technologies. But is the focus on the subjectivity of Banner/Hulk, and his fight with the father's figure, that made the movie so special.

Ang Lee's Hulk is a true author film as Peter David's Hulk was a true author comic. The peculiar style imposed by the author makes Hulk a great comic adaptation, possibly the best along with Spiderman 2.",10.0,22 August 2005

A huge miss,"This movie is a mess, with a lot of boring parts and the interesting parts are very few in between.

First of all, when you are making a movie about a green monster that smashes things, why do you turn this into a psychological drama? Not only was the psychological drama completely unnecessary it also failed to create actual drama. It's like nobody supervised Ang Lee. He definitely needed some supervision. The direction and editing is very weird. Ultra zoomed faces everywhere, split screens and picture-in-picture. Annoying! Due to the aforementioned attempt at psychological drama the pacing of the entire movie is bad. There's a scene near the end where two characters talk some boring nonsense face to face for six minutes straight and nobody is smashing anything. In a Hulk movie! Someone should've had the sense to see what a bad script this is and throw it out before filming even started. And funny enough, the movie ends right when there was something interesting about to happen. The Hulk is in some South American country and delivering medicine to local peasants, but local militia intervenes and steal the medicine. You see, that is interesting - there is some actual stake here, something to care about. The Hulk can use his powers to do some good, instead of randomly smashing things that confuse him. Anyway, this movie was a huge waste of money and talent. I should give it a score of one, but I'll add one more for the action scenes and one for Jennifer Connely.",3.0,4 October 2021
I'll take this Hulk before Raffalo's without even thinking about it.,"This is one of my favourite Hulk appearances. One reason for that is because it's kinda of different from the rest. Mark Ruffolo's Hulk is a joke, the Edward Norton's Hulk and the 70s version are pretty much a typical Hulk storyline. Exposed to gamma radiation, turns into a monster, travels across The Globe being pursued. We've scene all that more then once. I'm sure I'm not the only 1 getting tired of it. And Ruffolo's Hulk isn't serious enough. The Hulk is a popular character who has a very tragic life. This movie focuses on that. It has amazing smash scenes, Great interactions between the hero and villain, a very emotional journey, personal relationships with every character even the enemies and an insane cold blooded villain. I miss when movies were like this. Nowadays superhero movies drive straight into the main plot while this movie has an amazing build up to each event and some depressing scenes to help you feel Banner's pain. The final battle could have been better but that's it.",10.0,30 September 2022
disappointing,"i saw HULK on opening day while on vacation with my friends. i was in a mall theater, and frankly, i would have rather stayed in the mall wandering around. the movie was outright bad. the story was horrible and ang lee made it too much like CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON(which i liked). when the hulk was flying through the desert and when he was on the trees and the love story mirror ang lee's previous film. the parts of movie from the preview, which was all the action in the movie, were good, but the rest wasn't up to par. the hulk dogs were pointless (a french poodle?!) and it was overall not a good film. 2 out of 10.",2.0,25 June 2003
incredibly smashing,"Talk about pop culture comics with a heart, ""Hulk"" is really an incredible movie that combines sci-fi with elements of film noir. While most of those who have seen it complained of too much 'blah-blah' and not much 'blam-blam', I would say this goes down as one of the most gripping films I have ever seen.

Yes, the story is complicated and has a tendency to take itself far too seriously; so if it has to work, it has to be engrossing and exciting. The good news is, it is. It also brings along deeper motivations than just providing another action story by providing its own social critiques which gives the plot a significant depth lacking in most modern Hollywood movies. It asks the kind of questions about morality, justice, exploitation, society and a father-son relationship while telling the audience that this is not about a hero saving the world from evil. It's about saving oneself from the incarceration of anger and hatred.

Perhaps the most notable thing about this film is the offbeat cinematography that keeps a few idiosyncrasies around, probably to enhance the feel of comic books. This is shown mostly by the way some scene transitions were made especially the split-screen techniques, which all looked clean and functional blending with the aura that gave the film a unique characteristic. Plus the direction is brilliant, as might be expected from Ang Lee after his sensory feast that is ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".

Nick Nolte and Jennifer Connelly as Bruce's father and girlfriend, respectively, as usual give fine performances. Nolte's character could have been over the top as it is, but he manages to keep it right. Eric Bana delivers a fine performance as well as the troubled scientist who always had to live in fear and he manages to share the terror and vulnerability almost like a baby's reflex that makes him a character you immediately care about, innocent and tragic. And while the Hulk CGI doesn't really equal his LOTR counterpart Gollum in terms of quality, he does manage to hold his own by maintaining the central focus on him on every scene he is in.

Overall, while it did not catch up with Spidey who has now swung himself atop the box office, I liked the film as it really showed what Marvel superheroes really are: that they are heroes first because they save themselves from their own demons.

And that I think is all that matters.

Sheer Crap,"I wasn't expecting much, they really didn't do that great with the daredevil movie but I did expect this to be better than that, but it wasn't. They tried to make it artistic by zooming in on rocks, congrats you figured out how to bore your audience to death. They tried to pull something like the Warriors by going between comic strip and movie, they did not do well with it. It also had a very weak plot to it. The worst part of the movie was that he was only the Hulk for about 1/8th of it all. I saw more moldy rocks than I saw of the Hulk.

The Hulk definitely NOT family entertainment!,"I always enjoyed the TV series of the Incredible Hulk and after having seen and enjoyed Spider Man with the whole family, we went to see the Hulk, hoping for an equally enjoyable experience of a cartoon come to life. Well - this was definitely nothing like Spider man. If it weren't for the good computer animation of the hulk itself, I would have given this movie a 1 instead of a 2. Far too much time was spent in the beginning on shots of cruel animal experiments in science labs to try and provide ""scientific"" explanations of what causes the changes in the Hulk. A good editor would have cut at least 70% of these scenes. They add next to nothing to the story line and I just found them disturbing, as did my daughter. It doesn't get better from there. You can literally sum the rest of the movie up with: scientist changes into creature, military shooting with all they've got, girl crying, hulk changes back, REPEAT. Completely missing are any of the scenes that made the TV hulk into an endearing creature in spite of his monstrous appearance. The scenes that would have turned this film into a family movie. This is not a children's movie - in fact there is not one kid in the whole movie, except for flashbacks into the childhood memories of the lead characters (Hulk and girlfriend), both of which are awful memories and further disturbing to children.

I can't see how the Hulk would appeal to any more than a very narrow section of the population, namely those that get off on techno-babble, destruction, military gadgets, and computer animation. The idea of giving the film a ""comic book feel"", by dividing the screen into different sections showing different images at the same time, also doesn't work - it's only confusing. If I hadn't read about that part beforehand, I certainly would have been left wondering what the heck they were up to with the split screens.

My advice - if you're looking for family entertainment don't waste your time and your money on the Hulk. In fact this is not even a movie I would rent.

Unfortunately with this one the producers missed a great opportunity at another hit - too bad, since that's what the Hulk could have been.",2.0,6 August 2003
"The Hulk, Not Incredible!","The hulk has to be one of the worst movies i have ever paid 9.25 to see. No only was movie's plot much to confusing, the few action scenes that the movie had, really did not make any sense. In the final fight, the Hulk battles his father in the form of a lake. For some reason there are green particles that are constantly being ripped apart. This was outdone only by the unexplained flying through the clouds by a frozen/electrified Hulk.

In the closing scene as the camera pans out through the trees away from the Hulk look for the unexplained tree frog on his hat. Like every other part of this movie there is no reason for the frog.

Overall this movie was the worst I have ever watched. It is a good movie to rent for a good laugh, unfortunately it was meant to be an action/drama. A 1/10 isnt a low enough rating. Better luck next time Ang Lee",1.0,21 June 2003

"Entertaining, but semi-lame","I've been looking forward to this film ever since it I first heard about it, though that seems like it was a thousand years ago. Any chance to see one of my comic book heroes from my youth on the big screen is always worth the price of admission.

We've seen a lot of them, over the years...Batman...Superman...Captain America. (Ick.) We even saw the Punisher. The last few seasons have been a nice thrill ride. It's so nice to see the Marvel name up in lights. The X-Men. Spiderman. Daredevil. And now the Hulk.

I heard quite a few snickers when the Green Beastie was doing his Batroc imitation, but that was a serious cool factor for me. Too bad they couldn't have pulled that off back in the Lou/TV series days...I always thought that was kinda hokey, but heck, like I said...any time you get to see your fav comic book heroes come to life...

Anyway...back to the film. I loved Sam Elliot as General Ross. Awesome job. But the backstory...Oh. My. God. It's been a loooooong time since my eyelids actually got droopy in a movie. And the fades and transitions...hmmm...I'm not that familiar with the director, so I don't know if the frame screen sequences are a directorial trademark, or just a tip of the hat to the comic book panel origins of The Hulk. I just know they didn't do much for me...

All in all, I was just a little disappointed. After seeing what was done with the X-Men, X-Men 2, Spiderman and Daredevil, I guess I just had my hopes up a little too high. Visually, they made the Hulk everything I could have hoped for. I just think there was too much in the beginning, and the end...well, I don't care much for swirling, metaphysical baddies. Probably why I never cared for Dr. Strange.

So, I was entertained, but I would have been better entertained if I had waited until it went to the cheapie movies, or out on video.",3.0,4 July 2003
Surprisingly Good And I Hope We See A Sequel,"I will be entirely honest with you-I wasn't expecting much from this Hulk movie. After viewing the initial trailers, I thought, 'Oh no, this is gonna be rubbish.'

However, I was glad to be proven wrong and actually found this an enjoyable movie out of all the summer movies I had seen and I anxiously await the DVD release and the inevitable sequel.

Firstly, I think there are different types of people who didn't enjoy it. I've read some good comments on here from people who didn't enjoy it and I could see their points. Some people judged it on it's own merits and didn't like it which I think is fine. However, some people-before it had even been released-were comparing it to the 70's TV show and I think this subconsciously affected their judgement. I've heard people saying they didn't enjoy it because the Hulk was not CGI, there was no Lou Ferrigno in it, there was no Jack McGee in it and it was different from the TV show.

The TV show was the finest piece of work ever seen on the small screen. It was directed by Kenneth Johnson who was a real visionary and I still have respect for his vision of The Hulk. But this new Hulk movie wasn't made to imitate the original series. It was more in line with the comic book. In the comic book, The Hulk could jump for miles, throw tanks in the air and was a giant. Obviously, the TV show didn't follow the same path and featured a more tragic story and realistic events. I respect the visions of both Kenneth Johnson and Ang Lee. I just don't think it is constructive to compare a 70's TV show to a 2003 movie. The original TV series was perfect so there was no need for it to be told again. I think this movie needs to be judged for what it is and if people don't like it, that is fine. But not liking it because it is different to the TV show is, in my opinion, wrong.

Eric Bana does a pretty good job as Bruce Banner. Again, I am not going to compare his performance to the late great Bill Bixby. Bana did a good job of making the audience feel sympathy for him and I hope he is given the opportunity to expand on this in any future sequels.

The big guy himself was CGI but early trailers were misleading. He looked great on that screen and I liked the close-ups of his face and the anguish on it. And he looked amazing as he threw tanks into the air and jumped for miles. Fans of the original comic book Hulk will love those scenes.

Jennifer Connelly did a good job as Betty Ross and succeeded in giving here character some depth. Again, a two hour movie cannot really do justice to an interpretation of a comic book character. Perhaps if we can see a Hulk 2 and Hulk 3, then we can see more of Connelly's portrayal.

Sam Elliot did a fantastic job as General Ross. He was quite different to the General Ross from the comic which was a good thing. The comic book General Ross barked orders and acted like a clown at times which would not have been good for a movie. Things do need to change when adapted from comic book to big screen.

Nick Nolte did a superb job as David Banner, who was the father of Bruce Banner. Fans of the comic book will know about the abuse young Bruce suffered at the hands of his father and Nolte does a good job here actually making the audience feel both sympathy and disdain for his actions.

Josh Lucas played the villainous Glen Talbot. To be honest, he did a fair job but I didn't feel too much for the character.

I strongly urge you to see this movie-there are some great scenes such as The Hulk's battle with three mutated dogs and a scene where The Hulk ends up in the troposphere whilst on a USAF jet. And there are several nice references and nods to the original TV series. Plus, Stan Lee is in it and there's a brief cameo by Lou Ferrigno.

There may or may not be a sequel. I certainly hope we see a sequel so we can explore everything in depth. So movie producers, if you're listening, please can we have a sequel? If we don't get one then I may get angry. Don't make me angry, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry.",,20 August 2003
Missed the mark!,"What could have been a great movie, slogs through the first hour at an excruciatingly slow pace. Very weird directing where the screen splits into four different scenes, does more harm than good. Bruce Banner, a child of parents that lived in a military base that tested nuclear devices like Los Alamos, grows up to be a scientist too. When he is exposed to a dose of gamma radiation, the genetically mutated cells in his body go crazy and he is transformed into the Hulk using Shrek-like animation techniques.

The Hulk in this film looks and moves just like the Hulk in the comic book as opposed to the Lou Ferrigno (he makes a cameo as a guard at the beginning of the film) Hulk of the 80's. He battles gamma-mutated dogs, the military and his gamma-mutated father (played in an incredibly boring fashion by Nick Nolte).

Some of the special effects of the film are great while others look real cheap (the Hulk has a battle in the desert with airplanes that look like they came off a carnival ride instead of like real fighter jets).

Sam Elliott is great as General Thunderbolt Ross. The rest of the actors, especially the actor who plays Banner, need to go to acting school to learn how to put some emotion in their roles.

THE INCREDIBLE WHO FRAMED BRUCE BANNER STORY with guest appearances by the Hulk,"Bruce Bana is a mean-looking dude. When he says he likes looking mean, he's scarier than all of the romping and stomping the Hulk does combined. it's because Ang Lee's Hulk has those lovey-dovey hubby-dubby cute and adorably loveably gleaming disney eyes. They are so shiny and sparkly that how could anyone resist speaking in baby language while watching that cute innocent giant green teddy bear smashing its first military base to smithereens?

It's the same problem GODZILLA 2000 had. Enormous shiny anthropomorphic pupils in the eyes. The giant rubber God. could flatten Tokyo for good, and he would still look cute doing it. Hence the white-eyed pitiless Godzilla in the third installment. The Hulk could have been a greater visual menace had he had smaller pupils and the wrath of an angry Bana.

I'm not sure what Lee was trying to DO here. This is the H-U-L-K. He has the simplest &#@&% backstory of almost ANY comic character! Scientist is hit by Gamma Bomb, turns into mindless mass of green rage when he gets mad.

Lee took a whole (surpressing rage) HOUR to get Banner to Hulk out. Threw in some confusing repressed memory psycho father mumbo jumbo (the trailer blew that nugget already) while jumping PAST the love story! WHAT?!? (rage suppression failing).

A truly unique experience.,"No, seriously.

""The Hulk"" is not only an immensely underrated gem, it swells with originality not seen in any other comic book film at the time..

No, this is the first true comic book turned film. Forget the X-Men, hell, even Spider-Man. Ang Lee's vision not only makes this film unforgettable, he's able to do the unthinkable: he makes you feel like you're reading an interactive comic book.

Ang Lee's viscerally razor sharp editing and multi screen camera effects are still not to be matched. It not only makes ""The Hulk"" very unique, it's this characteristic that makes the film as good as it is.

Anyways, the film is about how Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk, as a combined result of his father David's (Nick Nolte) self induced experiments and gamma rays. The gamma rays awaken what was a part of Bruce his entire life, and they trigger whenever he has a momentary lapse of rage, usually when he has a nightmare. This is of course, after he discovers that not only is his father not dead, but he's been hired as the new janitor of the lab he works at. He was locked in prison for 30 years because of the experiments he performed on himself, and now he's back to doing the same old thing. Jennifer Connelly plays Betty Ross, Bruce's one time love interest and lab partner. She's good in the role, but one can only imagine what it wouldn't been like had they used her more. Sam Elliot turns out a very memorable performance as her father, the very same person who locked Bruce's father away. His sole duty in this movie is to be a hard ass, non-likable guy, who's sole purpose in life is to destroy the Hulk, and with that he does a very good job. Nick Nolte in my life has never done a bad acting job, and he really shines in this role, even if he does look like he needs a bath most of the time.

All in all, a very well written, acted, edited and directed movie. It simply does not deserve the bad reviews it's received.",9.0,5 July 2005
DO NOT SEE THE HULK!,"It is EASILY the worst of the recent slew of comic book movie adaptations. It is astoundingly bad. The first hour and a half could have easily been cut to about 10 minutes. Everything that happens in that hour and a half is what and how the Hulk came to be. Since the audience figures all of that out 10 times as fast as the characters do, I became extremely bored and impatient. This is the first super hero movie I've ever seen that was boring. Even bad super hero movies are at least entertaining, but not THE HULK. The last half hour or so is basically the Hulk kicking ass, and that part of it is pretty cool, but even those parts of it were poor in comparison to similar scenes in X2 and SPIDER-MAN.

The guy who plays Bruce Banner is the worst leading actor I've seen in the movies in recent years. Keanu Reeves is like Lawrence Olivier compared to this guy. Jennifer Connolly and Nick Nolte do what they can with their roles, but its hard to work with nothing. The biggest disappointment is that Ang Lee, who's CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON was so wonderful, directed this. I can't imagine Lee being proud of his work on this film. Compare the scene with Hulk vs. the dogs in the trees with Chow Yun-Fat vs. Ziyi Zhang in the trees and you'll see a major difference in quality and human interest.

One more thing: why do they do all of that split-screen crap? Every scene has this weird thing where the most minute action is shown from like 4 different angles at the same time. Why? Its annoying and quickly wears out its welcome. My guess is that they added that stuff later to make it seem like something interesting was happening, when, in fact, nothing interesting was happening at all.

Maybe I just didnt get it,"The Hulk is a slickly packaged comic book movie that will do decent buisness, but ultimatly fail to garner what Spider-Man and X-Men have done.

Eric Bana as the title character seems awfully reserved until he gets blasted by gamma radiation. His character turns into what best could be described as a pervert. Everything from his facial expressions to his demeanor is perverted. The movie attempts to tackle hard hitting science themes, but winds up as another King Kong rip off. Seriously, watch it and think to yourself, this is what happens when King Kong gets it on with a soy bean. Ang Lee tries to keep the film from collapsing on itself, due to a very weak story, with a comic book presentation of split screens. This is very well done, yet distracting from the final presentation. Overall the movie fails to live up to what it could have been, especially with the disasterous ending sequence that will have um rolling in the aisles. 2 stars out of 5 j.pauley",5.0,20 June 2003

Once again the movie does not live up to the hype,"I don't know exactly what I was expecting, but what I got made my head ache. This film is made up of a mish mash of odd camera angles, splitscreens and dissolves that actually made me dizzy at certain points. All of this is an unfortunate cover for the fact that the plot is missing. Thats too bad. The Hulk had some ""massive"" potential. The bright points were few and far between, although I thought both Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot turned in great performances, but theres only so much brooding Eric Bana one person can take. (He was so much better in Black Hawk Down)

In the second half the Hulk fights some tanks, helecopters and jets. Jumps around a lot and is even carried into inner space. All that action should have at least kept me awake and it did, barely. My hope is that after this piece of garbage and the terrible Daredevil movie that hollywood doesn't wash their hands of comic books again, but it looks like the genre may be on the decline. (Note: Look for cameos by Stan Lee and Lou Ferigno possibly the best part of the film as a whole.)",1.0,22 June 2003
The better Hulk movie!,"Comic Fan boys, and the initial critics looked way past the mark with this movie, and missed the sheer art of good story telling largely absent from so many of the Marvel universe. Yes the CGI is dodge, and the comic screen sharing is not too everyone's taste, but the actual story is great and so much better than the intro of Abomination. It's a well pieced together movie and thoroughly entertaining, with great performances from Bana and Connelly. I mean Bana is really good at acting angry, freak, it must have been a little unnerving filming him at times. So much better than Norton, (though he's an amazing actor, but he's not a patch on Bana in this role). This has to be a cult classic, while Norton's Hulk will be quickly forgotten.

What Happened to the Marvel Magic?,"I saw the Hulk on the opening Friday and was very excited about the movie; however, 30 minutes into the movie it was becoming really dull. The only really awesome part of the movie was when he turned into the hulk and fought with people. I remember the Hulk helping people all the time but in this film he is just destroying things. I understand where the movie was coming form and I am sure that many will like it but I do not understand why the magic that made Spiderman so great was not included in this film. In addition, the Hulk is not a children's film and has some astonishingly graphic scenes.

Ang and Stan Smash....what could have been a good movie,"My god this movie sucked, it was probably not the worst movie i have ever seen, but when you have a 150Mill.$ budget and something as cool as the hulk, you must be an idiot to make a bad movie.Well......i guess this must be a looneybin production then, because they screwed up big time. The CGI sucks, if the Hulk where a cartoon, he would have looked ok, but this is a real movie, and its sad to say that the series in the 70's made a better looking hulk then that classroom full of fat computer geeks.But this wouldnt have been as bad if the story was actually any good...but my god, what the hell was this??!!!!!! First it takes three days before you actually SEE the Hulk, and then it just makes you wish you never saw him, and CERTAINLY not that idiot of a father.And then there is the end, which is to dark, pointless and just looks awfull.

After Bombs like, Spiderman,Daredevil,Charie's Angels etc, this is just another megahyped, super expensive piece of crap. the kind that seems to dominate the boxoffice the last couple of years.

A couple of weeks ago i saw Jurrasic Park again on TV, and this ten year old movie looks ten times better then all the CGI created 'blockbluster' of the last four summers put together.

Hulk movie bad!,"This film was incredibly bad. I've read several comments from people trying to pretend they're more intelligent than they are by saying that those who don't like it just don't care for plot. This seems like ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" to me: ""Only smart people enjoy this film, so if you didn't enjoy it you aren't smart.""

I read comics as a child and still read them on occasion. I also watch mostly art films which are largely devoid of action. So, my criticism of this film has nothing to do with my underappreciation of plot or my lack of interest in comic books.

As for what I specifically did not like about the film, well, the story was just awful. This was extremely hackneyed and logically incoherent. For example, when David Banner is obviously angering Bruce, why do the military persons allow this to continue? They are watching the whole incident on television and know what will happen if Bruce gets angry, yet do nothing.

I've enjoyed other Ang Lee films (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Ice Storm)so I have to wonder what possessed him to make this. The comic book-style editing did nothing but detract from the film. It may have been interesting to use the split-screen occasionally during action sequences, but during the closing of a door or a low-key conversation? It seems as though Ang Lee was really trying to make a ""motion comic book"". However, if I wanted to read a comic book, I could, in fact, read a comic book. The interest in watching a comic book translated into a film is just that: the translation.

One good thing I will say about this film is that it was much better than ""Daredevil""",5.0,25 June 2003

Just Not That Good,"I really tried to like this movie.

I was a fan of the comic, and watched the 70's Bill Bixby show. I was a Hulk guy.

I read the reviews and saw that it was not your typical Blockbuster film. It was dark, it had depth. I liked what I was hearing.

But when it came down to it, the film just did not work. It was messy and convoluted - it trudges along and does not go anywhere. I don't mind a buildup and don't need to see an explosion every minute. But with so many flashbacks and information about the main character's fathers, it became a jumbled mess.

Make the story simple and make the emotions and experiences of the main characters complicated. Why did we have to have the subplots of the fathers? Couldn't a laboratory accident work by itself, and not have to be tied to the ""sins of the father"".

One positive is the CGI. When I saw the TV ads, I too thought the Hulk looked fake. But as I watched the movie, this was not the case. In particular the scenes where Hulk is being shot look impressive. The CGI is not the problem with this film.

Hulk is not ""Godzilla"" bad, but it is just not good either. Rent this film and save the money and buy a good movie on DVD.

What Went Wrong?,,3.0,21 June 2003
"The Best Comic Book Movie Of Late, But, That's Not Saying Much","One of the problems I have with Hollywood making comic book movies every month is that none of them are good. I've noticed that all of these comic book movies being made are just for the fans. None of these movies have strong enough character development. They are all campy. A movie like ""Spider-Man"" did try to make us believe what we saw, but I felt that the casting was wrong. ""X-Men"" movies are strickly for the fans. So if you know little to nothing about it don't even bother. It's a mess of a film. And then ""Hulk"" came out. I admit I thought it was going to be junk. And I couldn't for the life of me believe that Ang Lee was going to direct it. He has such talent. Movies like ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" are masterpieces of modern day cinema so why would he waste of talents here? I read good reviews for this film. The critics stated that the movie was unlike previous lame brain comic book movies and this one had depth to it. That Ang Lee was interested in telling a story and not so concerned with action scenes. This all sounded like a good idea to me. I thought just maybe I might enjoy this movie. But, alas it's not a very good movie. One of the first problems with the movie is it takes too long with it's set-up. Most people, even those unfamiliar with ""The Hulk"" comic books I think understand the character. You don't have to read a ""Superman"" comic to know who he is, do you? So there is fault one. We all pretty much know the basic premise of this movie already and the movie drags before it starts to make it's point. Flaw number two, ""Hulk"" wants us to take it serious and yet at the same time it's campy. The line ""Your making me angry. You won't like me when I'm angry."" sounds like something out of a second rate ""b"" movie. The final scenes involving the big fight is just well...lame. I mean think about it for a second. Just think about what Nolte is doing. The man turns into water!!!!!!! Another problem I had was that somewhere along the way Ang Lee got confused and though that the ""Hulk"" was ""Superman"" or ""Spider-Man"" because all of a sudden it seems like ""Hulk"" can fly. When he jumps he's flying almost. Lets be logical for a second. If a 15 ft 1,000 pound ""thing"" was to jump, would he A) fly away or B) Create a hole in the ground and maybe even get stuck? You chose. If I were to grade you, I would hope you all said B. Also a conversation between Connelly and Elliot it states takes place one year after the events when infact the way they are talking you would believe only a day, week, or a month has passed. There are some good things to say about this movie. It is the best comic book movie to come out. It's better than ""Spider-Man"", ""Daredevil"", ""X-Men"" and it's sequel. Ang Lee does TRY to create something more but, I just feel he was the wrong choice to direct this piece. Maybe somebody like John Woo. There's an idea huh? ""Hulk"" could of been a good movie. All comic book movies haven't attempted to create the atmosphere this movie does. All they allowed on was the audience already being familiar with the characters and just having lots and lots of fight scenes but never given the movie any depth. Here with the ""Hulk"" they tried to give the movie depth but forgot to make it exciting. The movie does offer hope. I honestly thought you couldn't make a good movie out of a comic book. But here with this movie maybe one day it could be done. Someone just has to find out how to blend the depth and the action together in a way that won't single the other out but yet balance the two out evenly so we are getting the best of both worlds. I feel it can be done now. We will just have to wait and see. ""Hulk"" gets ** out of **** or on a scale of 1 - 10 I give it a 3. p.s. Look out for a cameo from Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno (the original ""Hulk"" from the old tv show)",3.0,30 June 2003
"Nice try, or was it?","This movie had such potential, now it needs to quietly go away to the video store! How can a movie with such potential and star appeal go so very wrong?

"Misunderstood Masterpiece. Happy 20th anniversary to the ""Real"" Hulk.","As a young boy, I've developed a soft spot for this film since it was my introduction into the superhero genre and while it was bizarre and confusing at times, it was not disappointing at all.

You need to be open minded going into this adaptation because its unlike any other, but its definitely a step in the right direction.

I like that the character of Bruce Banner is taken seriously by exploring his early and present life. I also like how the accidental gamma exposure unleashed what was already inside him triggered by his trauma and repressed memories. This version of Hulk is the epitome of rage, power and freedom as mentioned in the film.

I'm well aware of the hate and criticism that it's received but don't judge it before watching it.

The had similar complaints with Man of Steel and look how much praise its gotten by standing the test of time.

Worst Super Hero Movie of All Time,"By the end of this endless, droning film, members of the audience were following my lead and riffing every scene ala ""Mystery Science Theater 3000."" Every member of the cast gives an uninspired performance, but special notice should be given Nick Nolte, who has gone from untalented to unwatchable. Every scene he is a part of is excruciating. Director Ang Lee is like a 10 year old given a new toy; push all the buttons and see how much cool stuff happens. His continuous screen-splitting is particularly distracting.

The script for ""The Hulk"" is neither logical nor literate. The viewer tries to follow the plot for a while, but eventually gives up and starts making fun of the whole sordid mess. The ending is especially incomprehensible. The only halfway decent parts of the movie are the scenes with the Hulk in them (and there are far too few). Watching the big green guy smashing cars and busting up the streets of San Francisco provides us with a glimpse of what might have been, in the hands of more capable flimmakers. At least an hour of this far too lengthy film could have been cut with minimal effort, but there still wouldn't be enough good stuff left to make the thing watchable. Hopefully, everyone involved with ""The Hulk"" will take a good hard look before embarking on their next film project.",1.0,25 June 2003
not a good movie,"Disregarding the hype, the buzz, and any expectations, The Hulk was simply a lousy film. It tried to be something that it wasn't. Rather than just accept the fact that it's a superhero movie about a big green dude in purple pants and take it for what it is, the film tried to intricate and deep, and the result was simply lame. The attempt for a complex plot resulted in a pretty week story that tried to be suspenseful by just not telling you things. This made it frustrating rather than suspenseful. It also made it very long and very slow at parts. There was way too much buildup. Anyone going to see a movie about a comic book character that becomes a green monster when he gets mad is coming to see an enjoyable (and expectedly mindless) action flick. The filmmakers should have just gone with this. Instead they took on deeper issues and tried for over-the-top and clichéd character depth that just simply did not work. The comic book panel effect was far too over used and really just gave me a head ache as I tried to follow what was going on in each. I wasn't impressed by any of the acting and was honestly bored throughout most of the film.

There are super-hero films like Spider-Man which understand what they are and work well with it. On the other end of the spectrum there are super-hero films like X-Men and X2 that take on more of a story line and add character depth and do a good job. This one didn't know where it was and turned out pretty badly.",1.0,21 June 2003
Such a let down,"To me, I thought this film was such a let down. After being a big fan of the TV series I was looking forward to this film. I found that it was a painfully slow build up to any action, with nothing of any interest going on. When 'The Hulk' did appear I just could not give it any credibility at all, to me it looked like a huge computer generated green monster. Yes I know the TV series had a man painted green, but I was quite young :) I still found it far more believable than what this film had to offer. To be honest I normally try to find something positive about most films, but to be honest, the only thing that was positive about this film was the fact that it ended. TRULY AWFUL",1.0,7 May 2006
I think the Hulk wrote the script....,"Yes, another comic book adaptation with promise bites the dust. If you sit through the 40 mins (yes....40!) before the Hulk makes an appearance and don't wonder when they are going to get on with it then you are endowed with more patience than 90% of the audience I saw it with.

The overuse of split screen images, designed to evoke the comic book feel, is grating. You can do this with comics because the image isn't going to change. With movies you have a pitifully small time to take it all in and you end up looking from pane to pane and miss the critical bits.

The music is hideously inappropriate - some kind of oriental sounding nonsense that just jars you in many places.

And as for the ending....what in Hell is supposed to have happened to the Hulk's father? Can anyone give a definitive answer?

It's adaptations like this that make people snigger at comic book and graphic novel collectors, when the fault clearly lies with the film-makers here.

That said, the scenes with the Hulk are OK, if a little stupid in places, such as with the tanks. The Hulk looks poorly CGI'd, but I put that down to wanting the comic book look. But it still looks about as real as Roger Rabbit, in some areas. You can either have reality, or cartoonish-ness. Mixing them doesn't work real well. Perhaps if they'd made more use of primary colours, a la Dick Tracy, it would have looked better.

Ultimately, a poor film that drags on and on.",5.0,28 June 2003

"The horror, the horror","You wanna talk about one sad comic book fan, I am him. ""The Hulk"" was the biggest let down of the summer, if not the biggest let down in comic book to movie history.

The special effects were pretty good but they only utilized them for one or two good action sequences. Can I ask where the storyline from the comic was? In fact, the only good thing this movie had going for it was the cameo by Stan Lee and Lou Ferigno. In closing, I would like to give you some alternative Summer comic options to do instead of throwing your money away on ""The Hulk"": go see X-men 2 again, save your money for ""The League of extraordinary Gentlemen,"" buy ""Daredevil"" on DVD it should be out soon (which I didn't see but I'm sure it was better than Hulk), or just do things the old fashioned way and go out and buy yourself a good graphic novel in trade paperback at your local comic or book shop.

Very good adaptation of American pop culture by a Taiwanese master.,"Ang Lee does a very credible job of tackling a piece of Americana in his direction of this film. For those of us who grew up in the early sixties reading Marvel comics and delighting in the exploits of Spiderman and the Fantastic Four, the Hulk is a nostalgic figure from our past. Lee presents us with an adult take on the comic classic instead of directing the story towards today's youngsters as they did with the X-Men and Spiderman.

In this film, the Hulk is shown as a real person who is undergoing a terrible transformation to his body and mind as the result of an experiment conducted by his egomaniacal father. The father wants to expand the power of the individual, to go beyond the boundaries given to man by God, and he changes his own genetic structure and passes it on to his son.

Eric Bana, an Australian actor with little experience, plays Bruce Banner, who becomes the Hulk. Nick Nolte plays his father. Jennifer Connelly (""A Beautiful Mind"") plays Banner's love interest, Betty Ross, a fellow research scientist at the Berkeley lab where they both work. Sam Elliott plays her father, a military man who was there when Banner's father conducted the original experiments years ago.

I thought the two young leads, Bana and Connelly, did an excellent job in this film. They played their parts as adults and not as what children think adults should be. This movie isn't bogged down with sentimentality like ""Spiderman"" was - there's no big kissing scene like two teenagers out on their first date. Banner and Ross have a matter of fact relationship and adult problems, and that adds to the seriousness of the story.

The story of the Hulk explores some topics popular with 19th century philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche, who challenged traditional moralities which would constrict the creativity of the individual. In that world view, each person's ultimate goal in life is to achieve maximum potential of one's unique self.

And as in that 19th century classic, ""Frankenstein"", the scientific experiments to alter life go wrong for the Hulk. Bruce Banner's altered genetics are triggered by outbursts of anger, and having repressed childhood memories and problems relating to people, he has a lot of hidden anger and frustration within him.

Much has been made of the unsatisfactory ending to the film, and I have to agree with those sentiments. I was barely able to tolerate Nick Nolte throughout the film when he was a minor character - Nolte tends to overact and chew up scenery - but it really dragged the film down when he suddenly became a major player in the story.

Other than that minor point, the film was well done. The computer graphics of the Hulk blend in perfectly with the live action (it's amazing how they've improved these techniques). Ang Lee also uses a split screen effect to show different angles of what's going on or to show multiple actions going on at the same time that I thought were very original.

I didn't expect to like this film as much as I did since I'm not a big fan of comics-to-screen films or movies that rely heavily on digital effects. But this one is very good and I recommend it.",8.0,3 November 2003

Long time Hulk fan finds latest treatment disappointing,"I have been a long time Hulk fan, having watched most of the seventies television series, and followed the comic book for 17 straight years. So naturally, I was eager to see Ang Lee's treatment of my favorite character. On the surface, it would seem that you cannot do much with a character like the Hulk. Here you have a big green guy who goes around smashing things. How can anyone make a good story out of that ?

Well, it would seem some people have managed to do just that notably Kenneth Johnson, Len Wein and the writer-of-writers Peter David. Unfortunately with the treatment delivered by Schamus and Lee, this audience member simply doesn't buy it. When I was a kid, the one thing that would intrige me the most was the transformation. Unfortunately when Eric Bana finally manages to get green behind the gils, you get the most uninspired transformation I have ever seen. The plot is average to poor. Some saving graces from the performances of Nolte and Elliot, but Bana as the main character is somewhat lacking in representing the tortured soul that is Bruce Banner. Schamus and Lee seem to have missed the point of the Hulk being a tragic character. The creature seemed to have no soul whatsoever.

If you want to see a good Hulk movie, get the DVD release of Kenneth Johnson's 1978 classic. This pales in comparison.

"Each time, makes me proud","Hulk is a very long movie, 138 minutes. Therefore, subtract 40 minutes, approx. 98 minutes are left behind that makes a movie. The first forty minutes of the movie was seriously criticized like there is no action in the first forty minutes, the first forty minutes are dull. This forty minutes are neither boring, nor uninteresting, in contrast exhausting because of Ang Lee's very fast editing. This is exhausting, but also raises the bar of the movie to me. And the first mutation rocks. Ang Lee is like a detail expert, one of the most detailed (so perfectionist) set decorations it has, there are a few unnecessary split screen shots but not important, the scene is great. Always, the first is the most important, so Lee gets through without any flaw. By the way, the accident that was criticized either is shocking. It seems mild, but it was 'silent and deep' and even tragic. Generally, the editing in Hulk is a revolution in super hero movies, there are countless amazing moments owing to editing. For example, Hulk throws a missile at a helicopter and no cut. The only action scene I did not like but extremely long is the scene Hulk fights the 'friends' of his father, because the idea was bad and the visual effects were flawed, but except this scene, the visual effects are flawless, the mutation moments are flawless. In the second movie, when Banner starts to mutate, they make it obscure, if you have seen it, you remember. For example, remember the gas bombs, why? In this movie, we see every bit of mutation which is just great. And Yes, no action in the first forty minutes, but Lee narrows the gap. It is very ironic that there are much more action scenes in Hulk than The Incredible Hulk. Besides the mentioned scenes, the last FORTY minutes are non stop action. This is really ironic. Hulk looks incredible, very green, very muscled, very big and very angry as he should be. Lee did not forget even his always purple shorts. Moreover, this Hulk is smarter than the second one, he does not shout like ''Hulk smash!'' or does not get angry with thunderclap, he is aware of everything, the other Hulk was not conscious except recognizing Betty. Yes, his jumps are very exaggerating, but who cares? May be, his face looks cute in some moments which is bad. Sam Elliot. It is cliché, but he was made for this role, I think, General Ross. He does not imitate Ross, he becomes Ross. People was praising Simmons in Spider-Man movies, it is nothing in comparison with this. Eliiot's character is not cartoonish and his performance is stark, thus perfect. I prefer Eric Bana as Bruce Banner, despite I like Edward Norton, because he was too 'good tempered' for this role. There is a secret enemy who recalls T-1000 in The Terminator 2, it might be a reference who knows and the movie becomes more astonishing and more powerful. As said, the last forty minutes are non stop action, a few split screen moments are far fetched, some of them are brilliant, but brilliant action scenes. The helicopter part is a victory.

However, this is just the introduction and development in terms of action and we see the most astonishing action sequence of the movie in the final part (or should I say the most astonishing final phenomenon in comic book adaptations history?)

Most Confusing Film Award,"One of the worst Super Hero films I have seen in a long time. The opening scenes are confusing and difficult to watch because of the use of 'Picture-in-Picture' techniques, often using the same scene shot from different angles. The earlier storyline is fragmented but does come together later in the film, I really lost interest because of this but pushed on to the end. Too many scenes seem to have been shot in almost total darkness and it was impossible to see what was going on during these times (which were many) especially the fight with dogs, this was almost completely lost to me. The sound also was lacking and much of the dialog passed by as the actors growling at each other, this was especially true of Mr. Banner Senior whose voice was so low that a subsonic converter should have been used instead of a microphone. The CGI of the Hulk was poor and unconvincing. As you may have detected I really enjoyed the film.",3.0,14 January 2011

What the heck was THAT????,"I have to confess that my expectations were low for the Hulk, ever since seeing the television commercials aired since the superbowl. My expectations, however, were lowered even more with each minute that I watched the movie (and trust me, I felt each and every minute). This film is in DIRE need of editing. The best thing: Elfman's soundtrack. As always, in top form. The worst thing: everything else. The CGI, yes it was okay... but c'mon... make it INTERESTING!! I didn't care for one character. And Nick Nolte... especially at the end... what the hell was all THAT about???? The story would have been better had they left dear old dad out of the picture. We didn't need sappy or sugary sweet, but providing some sense of momentum would have been appreciated. This movie inspired me to do only one thing: rush home and watch Spider-Man on DVD. If there is a Hulk sequel (and I'm sure there will be), I hope that it will be more dynamic in both story and pacing.

So it's not spectacular...,"Ang Lee knows what he's doing. Can we all just agree on this much, at least? He defies genre. He comes with a strong vision, and he gets results. He's done it with every project, and ""Hulk"" is no different.

This movie is not perfect. Far from it. On the whole, as a matter of fact, I'd have to call it average. The second act is overwhelmingly slow and riddled with flaws. The CGI is laughable (even for CGI, which let's face it, is usually pretty laughable).

But Lee does a better job than any director before or since at capturing the visual ""feel"" of a comic book. There are bold choices - double POV shots, insets, moving frames. He makes a real effort to make the movie LOOK like a comic book, and I don't think that he gets enough credit for what he did visually.

Also, the acting corps puts across some very good performances. They're a somewhat weak group, working with lackluster material, but they rise to the challenge, and the performances across the boards are better than the material warrants. Ang Lee steps it up here, fighting against overwhelming odds to put across a good final product.",5.0,18 October 2006

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Hulk","Art house director Ang Lee took on the ambitious task of making a summer popcorn flick with ""Hulk"". In my opinion, Lee has failed. He tries hard, damn hard to make Hulk into a ""deep"" film. Ang Lee is an art house director that makes movies for the intellectual minded moviegoer that prefer films with subtitles rather then watching action and quick editing. Lee's credits include ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Sense and Sensibility. With the ""Hulk"", he brings the same art house feel to this movie, but it's totally wrong. Lee tries to make a deep film out of a very shallow premise. Come on now Ang, this is comic book material you are working with.

Hulk is not supposed to be an artsy, talky film. This should have been a comic book movie, not an attempt at deep Jungian psychodrama. Hulk SHOULD have been a movie that was a 12 year old boys wet dream. Hulk should have been loaded with ""kewl explosions"" and lots of fake looking CGI. The Hulk succeeds in having plenty of fake looking CGI. The CGI created Hulk is terrible and very cheesy looking. But the film has very few action sequences, and what it does have makes little sense. We don't even get to see the Hulk until 50 minutes into the movie. Then there's that WTF ending that leaves you scratching your head.

By summer blockbuster standards, Hulk is already a box office bomb. It only raked in about $60 million in U.S. domestic dollars for it's opening weekend. You just know that there will be plenty of bad word of mouth for a movie like this, and then add on the unavoidable drop in box office gross for the second and third weekend and you have another Godzilla or Waterworld type film.

By the way, I saw SEVERAL WALK OUTS. It was usually parents escorting their restless kids out of the theater. Don't take a child under 10 to this movie. There is no bad language, sex, or gory violence,....but the movie is WAY too SLOW and TALKY for children. Any kid under 10 will be bored out of their ass with this movie.

The lead actor has no charisma, and the lead couple have no chemistry. We're not involved in Bruce's character, and don't really care what happens to him. It seems like forever until The Hulk actually appears, and when he does, he looks like Shrek on steroids. Literally the only positive things in the movie are Sam Neill's performance, and some moments of Nick Nolte's. Luckily, I got to see a sneak preview for free.

Requiem for a Dream meets Comic Books.,"What was Ang Lee thinking? This movie was the slowest moving movie that I have EVER seen. The first hour of this movie was nothing but boring background story with stupid cut scenes. The scenes were supposed to make it look like a comic book but all they did was annoy everyone. Every other scene contained a microscope close up (similiar to the drug scenes in Requiem). Then there were about 100 dream sequences. There was even a dream sequence INSIDE a dream sequence (when he is dreaming while looking at the photograph). If this movie was anything but a Comic book or Comedy, Ang Lee would have directed a masterpiece. But there was too much unneeded stuff going on. The fight scenes were barely legible. You can't tell anything that is going on in the fight scenes except for at the end when the Hulk jumps out victorious. They were boring at best. The one thing that I enjoyed about this movie was Nick Nolte. His roll was pathetically written but luckily it was acted well enough to get by.",1.0,21 June 2003

Misunderstood?,"No doubt about it, I love this film. It has much more depth and character development than any 'superhero' film I can think of (Spiderman? Xmen? - they're all gloss compared to this). This film manages to genuinely portray vulnerability using a story that is typical comic book genetically-mutated-being material where other similar films offer style but not substance. Okay, the ending throws the film a little off-kilter, but I can forgive it that. I think people's expectations of this film were mislead or misinformed before seeing it - it is not the average, run-of-the-mill, campy old superhero film. It has depth, and to achieve that it requires to be a little more of a cerebral approach to it. I'm not saying it's on the same level as an Aronofsky or a Polanski film - it's a blockbuster after all - but as such it's unfortunately not everyone's cup of tea when all they want to do it mong out in front of big explosions for an hour and a half.",9.0,4 July 2005

"Notable effort, lackluster result","What, precisely, are the elements that drive a successful action movie? It's a question that is trickier than one would think at first glance. This could be one of the reasons that action films, more than any other movie genre operating today, adhere so closely to well-worn cinematic traditions. So when a film like ""Hulk,"" the latest effort from Ang Lee and his frequent writing partner, James Schamus, comes along, it's hard to fault the creators for attempting something relatively different from the standard good-bad, bang-boom Hollywood fare. But ultimately, the film's flaws far outweigh the new perspective, dragging the film down in a mire of needless backstory and unlikely plot twists.

Eric Bana stars as The Man Who Would Be Green, Bruce Banner. He's a bottled-up biotech worker, fretting away in a top-secret research facility that is somewhat lazily funded by the military. Potential villians are everywhere: the general who signs Bana's checks (Sam Elliott), the hotshot private industry wag who threatens to buy out their operation (a sniffy Josh Lucas), Bana's deadbeat dad (Nick Nolte, doing an alarming Katherine Hepburn parody). Considering the number of shady character running around, it's surprising to find out how long it takes the pieces to fall into place for the creation of Banner's alter ego, or more accurately, alter id.

Bana's performance in the lead role is less than electric. The filmmakers would like you to believe this is intentional, but watching Banner for an hour - it's that long before we see The Hulk in the flesh - is a wearisome chore. Other than glowering at his coworkers, he does little more than shuffle listlessly between his microscope and his apartment.

Lee and Schamus attempt to depict the creation of The Hulk as a combination of scientific accident, repressed rage, and deep-seated psychological trauma: Banner's father was engaged in research very similar to Bruce's work, there are hints of a domestic accident from Bruce's youth; both Elliott and his daughter, Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly), seem to have a history with the Banner family. None of these separate plotlines come together in a satisfying manner. Instead of building towards a powerful resolution, they distract the film endlessly for the first half, then retreat far into the background during the second half.

When The Hulk finally appears, the film struggles to find him a worthy opponent. Since the most important battle, Banner versus his own rage and resentment, is internal, the action sequences seem secondary, although Lee stages some interesting showdowns against a barrage of tanks, super-soldier canines, and a creature than can assume the form of anything it touches. But as the film tries to juggle the dramatic and spectacular, neither are given the time or energy required to create a real impact. In the end, we are left with two half-films, both vaguely intriguing, but both far more green than ripe.",4.0,2 September 2003
Should have stuck with the source material,"This film is a terrible and boring adaptation of a beloved Marvel comics icon and a terrible and boring movie on its own. This is yet another example of what happens when Hollywood thinks they know best. The Hulk is popular for a reason. People like the character from the COMICS. The story was there, along with a built in fan base. Why not use it. ""HULK SMASH"" was really all they needed.

They unfortunately went with the ridiculous idea that a stronger Hulk means a bigger and faster Hulk. Cause as we all know that Lou Ferrigno was well known as an Olympic runner. Add in some terrible CGI and some giant mutant poodles and we have a success right? WRONG. This movie is only for a great example of how to not make a simple comic to movie adaptation.

The origins of Hulk drug on and on, it was soooo boring. NOT a good way to start any movie. All they had to do was have a quick flashback of the gamma bomb test accident, then lead directly into Banner evading the military and police, being spotted and then turn into the Hulk.

A hulking wreckage of a movie.,"I'm sorry, but for me this film was a huge disappointment. While I liked the 'split screen comic book style action', the dark aspect of the film, and Eric Bana in the role of Bruce Banner, I found the rest of the film to be quite boring. I'm not a person who needs constant action in a movie. I love a good plotline that grows but this one dragged on for way too long. It didn't live up to all the hype and it seems wrong it was marketed to kids so much when the movie comes across in a mature nature. Nick Nolte, in my opinion, was horrible. People in the theatre were laughing at because he was overacting so much. I haven't read a lot of the comics but I did see the TV Series and the movie (with Bill Bixby). I would have liked to see the movie go more of the route with Bruce Banner trying to keep his transformations a secret rather than the government constantly shooting at him for a half hour.

A CGI hero?,"Okay. I've seen a lot of movies in my life. Some were good, some were bad. Yet I always finished them. Once I started watching them, even if they turned out to be bad, I still watched them through. Thinking they could get better anytime. I even went through 'gayniggers from outer space'. That says a lot.

Not so with this one. This movie has the rare honor of being the only movie I just gave up on. Ever.

And I can't really figure out why. I love action movies. I love superhero movies. Loved the new batmans, fantastic 4's, spidermans, ironmans, even transformers, daredevil and the new superman. I also loved the Hulk series and the previous b-movies.

I remember how anxious I was when I first started to watch the movie. I was home with a friend, also a Marvel comics fan. The movie premiered on TV. I made it half through. So did he. The movie was still on, but we just stopped watching it.

I tried again a few years later, when it was played again. I decided to really force myself through it. But, the same thing happened - I gave up halfway.

Might be because the hero is CGI. CGI can hurt a movie, like Will Smith's I am Legend, but for the hero itself to be CGI...no. Too much. Might be because the movie's attempt for a plot/Greek tragedy/whatever is incompatible with an enraged main character that ultimately just mindlessly bashes things. Might be because half of the time I don't know what's going on or why.

The Nick Nolte Show,"****Excellent

***Good

**Fair

*Poor

Director Ang Lee successfully makes this a comic book movie but not a movie! With the exception of Spider-Man what has bothered me a bit about these Marvel films is that they don't feel like a movie. A comic book like a television show and book series keeps it's audience anticipating each new chapter or episode to see what's the latest or the conclusion in the adventure of it's hero. Comic books work the same way but a film however only has two hours to capture the imagination of the audience and keep them thrilled and excited. A film is like a rollercoaster ride. It's quick but exciting. Where Tim Burton's Batman, Richard Donner's Superman, and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man succeeded is in taking you to this fantasy world full of adventure and imagination and strapping you for the ride. With fascinating scenes, over the top characters, and unforgettable moments.

Ang Lee does a great job of exploring the world of the Hulk and he creates moments of beauty and rage but never magic. There's never a fascinating moment in the Hulk where like Batman, Superman, and Spider-Man you feel like you're in another world with larger then life characters. This film like a comic book keeps you anticipated for the next installment but doesn't fully allow you to enjoy it's world. And another flaw the film has is the CGI Hulk which looks as bad as the Scooby-Doo CGI. Perhaps that could also affect the film.

What I enjoyed the most about the Hulk is the performances. Eric Bana or Banana like the kids call him these days does a magnificent job as Bruce Banner and his chemistry with the beautiful Jennifer Connelly is magical. However, the BEST part of this film is Nick Noltes performance. He practically steals the show from the Hulk and makes it his own. He gives a great Oscar performance.

The Hulk movie that never should have been,,3.0,8 March 2019
Excellent movie,"I am a long time fan of the Hulk and a movie buff. I have fond memories of both the comic book and the TV show from my childhood. When I first heard that Ang Lee would be directing and that the Hulk would be CGI, I had mixed feelings. I thoroughly enjoyed Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and knew him to be a talented director, but a CGI Hulk sounded frightening to me as I felt CGI artists were still far away from being able to pull off human-like characters.

I can pleasantly say that my fears had no basis in reality.

Ang Lee has crafted a fine film and the CGI is convincing enough to work well. The Hulk is very impressive to watch and his close ups show a wonderful range of emotion. Watch for the scene early in the film where Nick Nolte's character first sees the Hulk. The emotion shared between Nolte's character and the CGI Hulk here is amazing and beautifully touching. That is not to say that the CGI is flawless, but it works for the most part and is a bold step forward in good CGI work - an area that will only make further improvements when directors such as Lee, Lucas, and Jackson with the necessary financial backing can push the animators to break previous limits. With the CGI discussion out of the way, I can now safely discuss the movie itself.

Hulk is an intelligent and moving drama and is the first comic book movie in quite some time that can fit comfortably in the same league as classics like Superman, Superman 2, and Batman. Like Hulk, these films were simply good movies that happened to be about a comic book character. Unfortunately, Hulk may prove too mature and cerebral for much of the core audience that is attracted to big blockbuster action films. For example, there is a scene where after the Hulk has reverted back to Banner, where we briefly glimpse Banner nude from behind and several people in the audience laughed, demonstrating the maturity of 6 year olds. Such a crowd may not be able to enjoy a serious film with actual character development, symbolism, and themes, but will alas find that they have stumbled into such a film with the Hulk rather than the mindless action feast that perhaps they were hoping to find.

Don't expect to see the Hulk until well into the film. Lee takes his time as an expert storyteller and develops the film's central characters so that we can understand and care for them. All the acting is top-notch. Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly have a nice and tragic chemistry (much better than Spiderman's Peter Parker and Mary Jane which IMO felt artificial and sappy) as the two lovers who have been separated by Banner's emotional distance and then later by his Hulk condition. Nick Nolte is creepy and fascinating as Banner's father and towards the end equally tragic though not as sympathetic. Sam Elliot is perfect as the fiery General Ross who wants to protect his daughter, but has come become a stranger to her through his overzealous attempts to keep her from danger. Also, I would greatly commend the actors who played younger versions of Nolte and Elliot's characters as well as whoever found and cast them. Not only do they perform admirably, but also they are spitting images of what I'd imagine the younger versions of the characters to look like.

The script nicely blends the classic origins of the comic book Hulk with a few new twists for a modern audience as well as the psychological underpinnings of the excellent storylines involving Banner's father and his past from Peter David's run as writer for the Hulk in the 80's. It is a thoughtful script that explores such classic and universal archetypes as the conflict between father and son while examining the ethics of genetics research and the nature of the military.

Lee goes to great pains here to give us a stylized film as well. The film features a very nice technique where multiple angles of a scene dynamically shift and play across the scene at once creating an energized feel that helps recreate the comic experience on film. It takes some getting used to at first, but ultimately it enhances the film and gives it a very distinctive feel.

And yes, there is a lot of action in the film as well. Once the Hulk is unleashed and becomes a hunted creature, we a thrust into the territory of King Kong and other great misunderstood beasts. Hulk definitely delivers some stunning action sequences that should delight the inner child that appreciates sheer awe and spectacle. This is the REAL Hulk as comic book fans know him. When you see the Hulk take on the army in this film, you'll see why no painted `puny' human can play the Hulk.

I thank Ang Lee and all the cast and crew for bringing us an intelligent film that takes itself seriously and delivers the goods as both a compelling drama and a spectacle. Viewers who enjoy good movies will find a rewarding experience here, while people looking for a simple thrill-ride should try something else instead.",9.0,21 June 2003
Terrible Movie,"I knew before I even went to see this movie it would be crap, and yes it was. Not only was the CGI terrible, but the story was as well.

This movie just doesn't cut it. Everytime he turned into the hulk I felt myself laughing at how ridiculous he looked. Good CGI = Yoda from Attack of the Clones, Bad CGI = The Hulk. Now this whole plot of him and his father was so bad I found myself wanting to fall asleep, and then when his father became the electric man I wish I had a gun.

I have to tip my hat to Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte who really stole the show. Elliot did the best job because sometimes you wanted to hate him and then other times you understand and even feel bad for him because he does what he has to do even though he may not want to...

The movie has great cinematography in which it occasionally splits into 2-3 rectangles to give you the feel that you're watching the comic book... It really is a cool experience

To close this out I have to say that comic book movies are getting better and better and have thankfully not gone the way of Bat-Man where the fight scenes looked more like a dance than a fight. This movie does have a great plot and story. I'd give it a 9 out of 10.",3.0,29 June 2003

Now I generally like comic book movies, even the not so good ones. But as an action film, this one is dead. We begin with Betty and Bruce having already broken up because of his lack of emotion, and that fault is carried throughout the movie. There is no connection between the two lead characters. But here, the Hulk kills needlessly. After bringing down a helicopter, he smashes his giant fist through the cockpit to make certain the crew dies. Is this a hero? His actions throughout the movie make him seem selfish. He's just mad all the time. The first ending is confusing, and says sequel, but the second ending is only tagged on, and SCREAMS sequel.

Hulk,"Hulk is a very surprising film. When I first saw it when I was like nine or ten I was confused, shocked and somewhat disappointed. My expectations at the time had not been met. What I had been expecting and hoping was just endless scenes of the hulk smashing sh#t up. What I got was an art film. At the time I didn't understand or care about any of the split screens, dream sequences, etc, I was just waiting for the hulk to show up and destroy stuff.(The hulk dosen't show up till about 40 minutes into the movie, by the way.) I eventually began to get restless because it is a very slow movie and when it was over I felt very disappointed.

A few years later I bought the DVD to give it another try, and I was very surprised with how good it actually was, now that I had gotten older and could appreciate the style, acting and pretty much everything else. The acting is quite good in the film, especially Nick Nolte, who almost steals the show as Bruce Banner's father, David Banner. Eric Bana is decent as the hulk, but I prefer Mark Ruffalo as the hulk in the avengers. Unlike other movies based on comic books, Hulk actually looks like a comic book, due to the split screens. This works most of the time,as it gives the film a unique look thats different from other comic book movies.

Now to the much criticised CGI, which for me is a mixed bag. The close ups of the hulk work, because his facial expressions are well done and you can actually feel sympathy for him. However the long shots of him, especially in the desert scenes, look a bit cheesy but definitely not as bad as some critics have been saying. Apart from that the visual effects are top notch.

Overall, Hulk is a refreshing change from standard and bland superhero movies. It takes its time setting up the plot and characters, which works because you have almost fully fleshed out characters and not cardboard cut outs. The repressed memories and psychology of the hulk is much more interesting than the standard heroics of superman or captain America. So to sum it up, I wouldn't recommend this movie to young kids because there are a number of intense scenes and it is a fairly long and slow movie, so those with short attention spans won't be well rewarded. But for those who are prepared to accept that it is more an art film than an action film then you will be well rewarded.

The film isn't perfect, but every time I watch it on DVD it grows on me and I find myself wishing sometimes that more action blockbusters were like this, but then if they were I doubt they would be blockbusters.",5.0,7 June 2020
"Ang Lee, Stan Lee, No Relation","Well, it had to happen. Ang Lee has finally made a bad film. The genius of The Wedding Banquet, Eat,Drink,Man,Woman and Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon has found a genre he just doesn't get.

I've never been a fan of the (Incredible) Hulk, but since Ang Lee directed the film, and Aussie boy making good Eric Bana was playing the lead (well, the part of the lead played by a human), I went along.

Oh, dear.

It started well. The credits sequence was quite dazzling in the way it conveyed so much information, in such a clever way, without a word of dialogue.

As the film proper got underway, I liked all the clever split-screen, comic book edits. Reminded me of those pop art films of the 60s.

But after a while, I realised why they were there. They were to disguise how BORING the film actually was. If it weren't for the flashy cuts, dissolves, split screens, there would be NOTHING to hold your attention.

The big mistake was to treat the Pulpy Hulk like he was Greek tragedy, rather than Marvel Comic. Such a silly super hero premise does not stand up to Serious Acting and Portentous Writing. Leave that for The Ice Storm. A comic book adaptation should be fun.

So we wait for about an hour before the Hulk finally appears, and then he's not too convincingly animated. More like a video game character than a big screen (anti) hero.

Eric Bana struggles in the role of Bruce Banner. Jennifer Connelly fares better as the heroine. Nick Nolte is .... well, more like a Marvel villain at least.

I don't know who the film is aimed at .... it's much too violent and scary for kids, too boring for teens and twenties, and too juvenile for older adults.

But I'll still look forward to Ang Lee's next film with anticipation.

GARBAGE!,"The Hulk was the most god awful piece of crap ever! This was two hours and twenty minutes of my life that I want back. I sat there for like an hour waiting for Bruce Banner (played terribly by Eric Bana) to turn into the Hulk. I sat through endless amounts of garbage that didn't have anything to do with the movie when it all added up. I particularly remember two scenes that were significantly horrible: 1) When The Hulk jumps on an airplane and it somehow takes him to outer-space, then he falls to the oceans and survives! HOW DID THE PLANE TAKE HIM STRAIGHT INTO OUTER SPACE?!?!? I have no idea. And 2) He jumped like three states with each and ever leap he makes. The last time I checked I didn't know the Hulk could fly! Another terrible part of the movie was David Banner (again horribly played by Nick Nolte). He served no purpose in the movie other than to be a horrible actor and yet another pointless addition to the already much confused plot of the movie! I will urge everyone I know very strongly to not see this movie, or if they want to see the worst work ever created out of a comic book...than they can go see The Hulk. As for me, MARVEL just lost a lot of trust here!",1.0,20 June 2003
"Interesting, quality look at an unusually cursed super hero.","Like the Frankenstein stories that are its predecessors, ""Hulk"" is a warning about the folly of those who would toy with the secrets of life. It is about the anguish of having powers you did not seek and do not desire. ""What scares me the most,"" Banner tells his only friend, Betty Ross, ""is that when it happens, when it comes over me, when I totally lose control, I like it."" Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" (the movie's title drops ""the"") is the most talkative and thoughtful recent comic book adaptation. It is not so much about a green monster as about two wounded adult children of egomaniacs. Banner (Eric Bana) was fathered by a scientist (Nick Nolte) who has experimented on his own DNA code, and passed along genes that are transformed by a lab accident into his son's hulkhood. Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) is his research partner; they were almost lovers, but it didn't work out, and she speaks wryly of ""my inexplicable fascination with emotionally distant men."" Her cold father is General Ross (Sam Elliott), filled with military bluster and determined to destroy the Hulk.

Spiderman (in particular) follows the exact steps you can read in a tutorial for film making that may be neat to watch but leaves no space for surprises or artistic inputs. Ang Lee seems to have taken especially this thought very seriously and created a piece of art that the average pop corn formula film liking movie goer may find hard to digest. No doubt, this movie is not made for assembly line film lovers. It is constructed very thoughtfully and goes beyond the interpretation of a superhero. It plays with the chaos that erupts out of the events rather than glorifying another world savior.

There is no real good and evil, there only is an overcharge from both sides that don't know how to master the situation. The American movie goer averagely wants black and white sides, a proud United States flag waving and a hero that saves the day (nation and eventually the world, maybe even the universe). Nope, not in this one. While most of the other films establish superheroes as something that fits perfectly into our society, Hulk plays with the idea of what would happen if unknown uncontrolled unnameable power surfaces and that both sides act incredibly humane. At this point 80% of movie-consumers are out and 90% of movie-lovers come in (that number is small as we know).

The crux is that this movie does not know who it's aimed at. The intellectual Ang Lee connoisseur picks his nose when it comes to the Hulk, simply due to its humble roots, while the average pop corn cinema goer is slightly irritated when confronted with the films odd approach to comic movies. This means that only viewers which are a bit of both can truly appreciate this masterpiece.

The movie brings up issues about genetic experimentation, the misuse of scientific research and our instinctive dislike of misfits, and actually talks about them. Remember that Ang Lee is the director of films such as ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Sense and Sensibility,"" as well as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""; he is trying here to actually deal with the issues in the story of the Hulk, instead of simply cutting to brain less special effects.

All the other elements for a good piece of entertainment are there and present: Eric Bana is, as usual, fine as the tormented soul which manifests itself in green rage, Jennifer Connelly is as solid as ever and Nick Nolte steals the show with what is a truly weird turn as Bruce Banner's/the Hulk's dad. The visual effects are beautifully executed as well. There is not much left to be desired.

Five years later the audience won and an assembly line version was released, not as bad as some others but definitely not as creative and visionary as this one. Great job Ang!!!",9.0,13 June 2020
"Awfule, dreadful wanted my money back!","First off I had high expectations for a hulk movie. How could you mess it up? Well, you can. The plot was slow and boring, if existent at all. The hulk only looked cool at night when you couldn't tell it was cg as much. Day time shots of the hulk look funny, not scary and hulk like. I found myself constantly looking at my watch and waiting in hopes the movie would get better. It didn't. The use of comic book panels was over done in my opinion, the dialog was terrible, the action was pointless at times and the whole over all movie was just a big waste of my time. I saw this movie with a free ticket I got for buying the video game... and I wanted my money back. I was actually Angery after watching this film because of how poorly it was done.

Do you have any clue as to how bad a movie has to be to make me angry? So far only one movie has done it, and its this one. Others have come close. In my opinion, don't waste your money, or your time on this movie. Its best avoided like a plague and it would be even better if Hollywood would forget it was made and let a real director and writer that knows how to make a movie remake this film, with a better plot, script, directing, and effects.

Did an accomplished director really do this?,"Does anyone remember the 180 Degree Rule? Apparently not while making this movie.

For anyone who didn't take film 101, the 180 Degree Rule says that the camera must stay on the same side of the action to ensure constant screen direction from shot to shot. They didn't do that in this movie, so from time to time the characters jump from one side of the screen to the other, and appear to be looking every which way.

Someone should be embarrassed. This is really basic stuff. For a film maker, disregarding the 180 Degree Rule is the equivalent of a novelist just leaving all paragraph breaks out of their book. It's just sloppy.",5.0,23 June 2003
"Slow Start, Somewhat Entertaining. Too Long","I watched the Hulk was probably lower expectations than normal as several people had already said it was a ""middle of the road"" movie. We saw it on DVD and it has a very slow start. It does however pick up a bit in the middle where we eventually see the green guy do his thing. This was entertaining/funny but not at all very realistic. But why would you be watching a super hero movie if you're looking for realistic.

The movie takes a bit of a downward turn in the end - I never did fully understand what was going on.

Overall probably less than excellent. If you want to see a good super hero movie checkout the X-Men or even spiderman. They're better. Possibly even Daredevil too - although thats open for question. If the Hulk was stripped down to about 60 or 90 minutes it would be a much better show.",4.0,21 November 2003
Passes time,"We all know it is a no-no to do genetic experiments on people. And once again a scientist David Banner has to do it to himself. Now to compound the problem he passes a trait onto his offspring Bruce Banner (Eric Bana). Add a little lab accident and et voila instant hulk.

This is not the best integration of real, animation and CGI. Yet the story is told and you have fun watching. There is a father/son conflict and a misunderstood Hulk dismantles a lot of military equipment with extreme prejudice. This film does not try to follow the TV series and is not so dated. The only real drawback is that Jennifer Connelly is just too cute and you forget to keep track of the storyline.",10.0,7 December 2023
Realy looked forward to it and was Disappointed,"I was a big fan of the TV series way back when and was ready to see this one the first week it came out. When I read these other reviews about how much thet loved it I begin to think I missed something. Then I scan it again in my mind and come back to disappointment. I didn't mind some of the deeper side of the tormented banner but an hour and twenty minutes of skerting around issues that could of been delt with in the first 30 minutes was to much for me. When the end finaly crawls across the screen I found myself interested, but as soon as I was I found myself once again scratching my head asking ""what the hell was that"". Wait for the video, or better yet just watch the trailer a few more times. All the good stuff is in it anyway.",5.0,24 June 2003
A Supporting actor,"As I was watching the Hulk, I couldn't help the feeling that I was seeing a starring actor in a support role. There appeared to be more time spent on the supporting actors than on the supposed ""main actor"".

While the characters were interesting, I think a more interesting story would have helped the move a lot.",5.0,23 June 2003
WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!,"I never liked the Hulk in my entire life, and only went to see this dog-fodder because there wasn't anything else to see. It's a really bad movie, with horrible direction, including horrible comic-book paneled scenes. The guys who made this may think that making the film seem like a comic is cool, but it's rather distracting. I even got motion sickness from it. Also, they constantly go into dream sequences and flashbacks, so you'll never know what's going on.

BOTTOM LINE: Hulk smash. Hulk destroy. Hulk star in very bad movie. Avoid this. Even the horrible X-men 2 is preferable to this one.",1.0,4 July 2003
Sound and fury signifying nothing,"I admire much of Ang Lee's previous work, so I was curious to see how this project would pan out. I decided to see it despite some of the scathing reviews because God knows there have been many great films that were misunderstood at first. Unfortunately, this film succeeds more as a bizarre curiosity than as a popular film or as a work of art. I'll try to cover the salient points:

STORY & CHARACTER: Like something I blew out of my nose. The characters are all one-dimensional Freudian stereotypes, and that's during their better moments. So many baffling questions remain: what the heck was David Banner fighting with his wife about when he `accidentally' killed her? More to point, why would a lovely woman like her even marry a psycho bully with a cheesy moustache like him in the first place? Why is General Ross such a turgid pr-ck? Did his daddy beat him too? How on earth did a monster like him sire such a calm, composed (if weepy), loving, intelligent, down-to-earth woman like Betsy? Who were the people who raised young Bruce? His adoptive mother (whom we see exactly once) seems like a good woman: why is he so emotionally cold and repressed when he was raised in such a loving family? Are the filmmakers trying to imply that genes are everything? I realize that these are silly questions to be asking about the characters in a summer blockbuster, but hey, the filmmakers are the ones who insisted on bringing family psychodrama into the picture, not I. Making a psychological drama with one-dimensional characters is about as interesting as making a porn film with mannequins.

CINEMATOGRAPHY & EDITING: There was some interesting experimentation going on here but it was inert: it did nothing to contribute to the story or add up to a coherent aesthetic experience. Sometimes there were multiple panels and sometimes there weren't, but it all seemed rather haphazard. The jelly fish and cellular patterns and lichens and so on were pretty, but overused.

The editing was inept and self-indulgent, with huge stretches of dead time. Lots of totally unnecessary transition scenes, people just sitting around, stuff that even Tarkovsky might have left on the cutting room floor.

DIALOGUE: It absolutely defies belief that James Schamus, the man who gave us the zippy repartee of The Ice Storm, had anything to do with this script at all. I'd like to blame the other two screenwriters for this botch, but I don't see why he didn't just rewrite their migraine-inducing contributions if that were the case. I think there was maybe one (intentionally) funny line in the whole movie.

ACTING: Eric Bana: Tried to look repressed, wound up looking constipated. Maybe that's what caused his transformations: `HULK STUCK!' Too bad they didn't do a product tie-in with Metamucil. Jennifer Connelly: She's starting to get good at her one and only character. Nick Nolte: Not as bad as he was made out to be. He went over the top, sure, but there was something almost King Lear-like about his performance. Sam Elliot: Silly stuff, but he did what he could with a bad script.

There were a few interesting ideas in this film, the best of them probably being the conception that fathers want to suck the lifeblood out of their sons. This kind of pushes it too far of course but I'd guess even the most devoted fathers sometimes envy their sons' youth, vitality, energy, sex appeal, what have you. So this turns into a nice inversion of the Oedipal complex, played out when father and son confront each other and Bruce says, `I should have killed you,' to which David Banner says, `No, I should have killed you.' A lot of people laughed at that line, but I think it sums up the most interesting conceit in the whole film. There was also a kind of Faustian subtext to the whole thing, but the Faust legend has been done endless times before and much better than here. The only truly believable Faustian bargain here was the one that Lee/Schamus made when they accepted this project.

Despite everything, though, the film does grow on you in a `boy I wouldn't want to sit through that whole thing again but maybe I'll rent the DVD to fast-forward to the interesting bits' kind of way. For example, I'm still haunted by that look of melancholy ecstasy on the Hulk's face as he's flying through the sky. Was it worth sitting through hours of dreadful dialogue, creaky plot mechanics, and static editing? Probably not. It's not worth a bar of Schubert, that's for sure. But who knows, maybe this mad, mad movie will keep growing on me to the point that I almost, just barely like it.

All in all, this movie was a noble failure. Ang Lee and his team tried to breathe new life into a tired genre and create an ambitious film that would appeal both to mindless teenage boys and to thoughtful grown-ups who read Freud and Faust. Well, `I've got a news flash for you' (to borrow one of the clichés that litter the script): it can't be done. It puts the work at catastrophic cross-purposes with itself. There's something frankly hysteric and schizoid about this film: stretched in all directions, it is animated primarily by an infantile acting out, an undisciplined excrescence of repressed material on the part of the filmmakers. This is sort of fitting when you consider the subject matter, but it seems to me in the end to be a fatal confusion of means and ends, content and technique.

Please Ang Lee, please, no Hulk II. I and others admire your desire to stretch yourself; nobody expects you to go back to the lovely low-budget days of Wedding Banquet or the lively cynicism of The Ice Storm. But there's just got to be a better way.",5.0,7 July 2003

In a Word...,"HORRIBLE!!!

Where do i start? The Hulk isn't one of my favorite Comic Characters but Ive always been interested in him. Before going into this movie i thought this movie would have a horrible CGI Character and A SUPER Awesome Plot. What I got was switched around.

The CGI was pretty awesome except for the desert scenes. I mean He looked great and had awesome facial features. The shadow and dirt was good too.

The story in one word or less.....SUCKED. They could have stuck to the comics a little more. The script for this film should have never been greenlit.

Somewhere in the middle...,"Comic book adaptations walk a very dangerous line. Generally, those that succeed do so because they adopt a gritty, realistic feel that taps into the struggle and cynicism of our times. The first two Batman films and the recent X-Men adaptations are good examples of this. By giving the characters a modern sensibility while respecting the original roots of the the story, these films manage to prove the continued relevance of the titular characters.

Hulk fails where X-Men and Batman succeeded mainly because it cannot make up its mind whether to root itself in the 1960s style of adaptation, or whether to take a more modern approach. As a result of the hokey, overacted style taken on by the bad guys, Hulk's eventual victory over them seems more pre-ordained than anything resembling a struggle. None of the film ever really feels like it was designed with any other outcome in mind.

The strengths of the film start with the moments when the Hulk unleashes his immense rage upon his attackers. The tanks and the helicopters get smashed in a way that appeals to the angry little boy in most of its primary audience. Like it or not, the concept Hulk has always been aimed at young men with anger management issues, and when Hulk displays his chronic lack of self-control coupled with his immense strength, it works best.

Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly give the film its other big selling point. During the moments when Bana isn't replaced by a massive CG construct, he gives the man inside the Hulk a human quality that allows the audience to get behind his green alter-ego. But when Bana is out of the picture, it is Connelly who keeps the audience focused. Her simple compassionate pleas for her on-screen father, and by extension the audience, to recognise the humanity in this giant killing machine are what maintain the emotional connection to the character once Bana's contribution is worn out.

To be fair, I didn't think this film was as bad as some have made out. The problem is that with competition like X-Men 2, it isn't all that brilliant by comparison, either. Aside from Bruce Banner struggling to solve the pieces missing from his history while Hulk beats the stuffings out of everything that gets in his way, there really isn't that much in the way of story on offer.

I gave Hulk a five out of ten. The exposition gets boring on repeat viewings, enough so to make me think about giving it a two out of ten. This is made up for by the incredible fight sequences. If there'd been a couple more moments of throwing tanks or missiles, I might have given it a higher score.",5.0,21 September 2004
The best adaptation for this character,"When I first saw Hulk, I didn't have much expectation on it, I really got surprised about how much I liked. I didn't know who was the director, and later when I discover it was Ang lee, I understood the special style of the film. The beginning is the part I liked the most, the music and the way the images are displayed is really pure art, the movie it's not perfect, but it's far the best adaption I could imagine for this character which is not really my favorite from the Marvel Universe, but since I saw this movie that perception has totally changed, The cast and the performances are also very good. I still don't understand why some people didn't like it, fortunately the majority of friends I recommended the movie have agreed with me ""the movie is really a great adaptation from the comic book"" I just hope the second part won't ruin what the first one achieved",9.0,25 February 2008
Worth this review...,"Though I normally not write reviews of any kind, this movie just forced me to include a small note since the reaction it inspired in me was unique. The movie was bad, quite bad. The plot is simple and essenceless, the acting is inadequate, especially by the main character who reminded me of a psycho instead of a repressed person. The CGI was overdone and made the movie look way too fake. The confrontation towards the end was the stupidest ""battles"" ever and made no sense. The whole movie is basically about this psycho who screams and throws tantrums and turns green. Then he takes huge leaps from city to city (what??!) and fights with mutant dogs. The main actress is only eye candy and her only purpose is to be the anti-depressant of the hulk. I gave this movie a 4 and I am generous as after one hour into the movie I was falling asleep. At the end of the movie people booed the film, not to forget the laughing when the hulk was jumping all over the world. DON'T WATCH IT and I am a HUGE Marvel fan. X-Men still rule!!",4.0,20 June 2003
Disapointing,"I was very dissapointed in this movie. I thought Marvel could have had more plot and less building up to the plot.

"Big, boring disappointment","The Hulk didn't disappoint me, really. I went in expecting a bad movie and came out having seen one. The funny thing is, after seeing previews, I thought the CGI effects were going to be too over-the-top and that would be what I wouldn't like. Turns out, the CGI was really well done, but the rest of the movie was slow, slow, slow.

There really are many things to dislike about the movie, so I'll just name a few. 1) Character and story development take way too long. By the time the Hulk first shows up in the movie, I was ready to leave the theater from sheer boredom. 2) Although an interesting style, the comic book pane look is distracting and annoying. 3) Too many bad guys, none of which is satisfying. A cranky general, a love rival/corporate type, and a demented father. That's the best they could come up with? I could go on, but why bother...others will undoubtedly provide ample examples.

To summarize:

If you're looking for drama, you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for action, you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for romance, you'll be disappointed.

Underwhelming,"Ugh.

If you're a comic book fan, you're gonna LOVE it. If you're like most other human beings, you're gonna find a lot wrong with The Hulk.

I think the reaction of the average kid will be mixed. Some will like it for the visuals (when there are any), but I think most will be bored through most of it. And some will be scared in a couple of parts.

Eric Bana was decent, but largely boring in the film, and it won't help people to connect with his character any more than they already would (or won't). Nick Nolte, Sam Elliot, and Josh Lucas all overacted more often than not. Jennifer Connelly was solid, and the only positive on the acting front.

The CGI was a mixed bag. The first two times you see the Hulk, it's at night and there are a lot of close-ups, almost to obscure things ... was the CGI 100% completed? Can't really tell in those. But the desert scene is very well done ... although the running animation looked choppy. And I have to agree with the Dallas Morning News ... ""He looked like a green Pillsbury Doughboy."" Especially when he's being hit with bullets ... it looks less like muscles and more like a green ooze. However, the entire desert battle was well-done, and should be what most people will refer to as their favorite part of the film.

There are a few plot holes in the final act, and from two friends of mine who saw it last night (in different cities) both didn't think they were plot holes, mainly because they're big fans of the comic series, and they just knew who the ""Great Absorbing Man"" or whatever the hell he was called. For most of us regular summer action Joes ... well, the final act is one big mess. And the other problems I had with it will wait until you've seen it, as they are scene specific.

For once, the early word on the internet was correct! One of the early reviewers said, ""It won't matter what kind of prom dress they put on this pig...""

So, two final ratings: Comic book fans - 3 and a half stars The rest of the filmgoing public - two stars

I think the film will do between 75 and 80 million on opening weekend, because of the hype and the marketing has played to children more than they did in the beginning ... I mean, it looks cool to see him jumping miles and smashing. But I think the word of mouth will be lukewarm, and that will hurt the business throughout the rest of the term, especially with Charlie's Angels 2 coming out next weekend. A warning for the Hulk: Unless you count the over-acting, there is ZERO humor in it, so people will be ready for some humor to go with their action next week, and they'll also be ready for more action than thirty minutes out of a 138 minute film. So I think it's gonna finish around 200 million, and not the 300 or 350 that some are predicting.",5.0,20 June 2003
The Hulk: 9/10,"If you go into The Hulk expecting Spider-Man, you'll be surprised. With only a few action scenes, and more drama than you can shake a stick at, it's clearly the best comic book movie to date, and, so far, the best summer movie. I'm actually surprised that Ang Lee would risk losing the teen demographic for this, but the movie turns out better for it. The Hulk has a perfect mix of action and drama, and, although I don't read comic books, has the feel of a comic book.

Kudos goes out to Lee for turning in an excellent directing job. With more split-screens than The Thomas Crowne Affair, it may get annoying for some people, but to me, I really liked it. Also, Lee didn't always have the whole screen covered up by the movie. Although the split-screen wasn't always necessary, it added to the unique look of the movie. Lee wasn't a Hulk fan before he signed on to direct this movie, but the whole thing looks like a giant comic bookyou'll have to see it to understand what I mean.

The plot is actually THERE; it's involving and has depth. Scientist Bruce Krenzler (Eric Bana) is working on the same project his father David Banner (Nick Nolte) worked on years earlier, a human regeneration project. David tested it on himself, and passed it on to Bruce. However, they become separated, and Bruce moves into the Krenzler's house. However, he is reunited with David, but an explosion in the lab causes Bruce to become a giant, green, CGI Hulk every time he becomes angry.

If a movie this far-fetched can seem so real and plausible, then that can only mean one thing: everyone involved with this movie deserves a raise. Usually Universal movies have cheesy special effects (U-571 for instance), and the Hulk in no way looked real, but for a CGI dude in a live action world, it worked well. When the Hulk interacted with humans, I was in awe. However, at the end, when the Hulk was fighting another CGI monster, that looked like it was a sigh of relief for the crew.

Bana proves that not every superhero has to have a bad actor play him (i.e. George Clooney in Batman and Robin), in fact, he's a great actor, and now that he's sort of well known here in the States, he'll probably get better roles (the same is happening to Tobey Maguire after his role in Spider-Man). Jennifer Connelly, for the first half, shows that yes, she is a good supporting actress, but in the third act, makes the Academy wonder what they were thinking when they gave out her best supporting actress for A Beautiful Mind. `Let me talk to him, Dad.' `Dad, let me talk to him.' Sam Elliott, who plays Betty's (Connelly) over-bearing, military father who has something against the Banners, does what he's supposed to do. The real standout, however, is Nolte, yet again. After his somewhat lackluster work in The Good Thief, he's back again, stronger than ever.

Many people won't like The Hulk because they want it to be what it isn't: another mindless action movie for the summer. It's actually one of the most intelligent movies of the summer, and, dare I say, the year, so far, and expect it to be on my top ten list for the year.

Don't waste your time!,The movie was very slow for the first half. The acting was a joke and the split/multiple screens was distracting. I was very disappointed in this and frustrated that I wasted my time to go see it. Save yourself the money and the time. Skip this one.,1.0,10 September 2003
"OK,Nothing Special","After a massive amount of hype I must say I was a little saddened to see the end result.With movies like this you just wanna see the man get angry,turn green and watch the destruction.But what you get in this is a real drawn out description on how he is the way he is.We dont care,get on with the action.The way the film is shot in its comic book style is excellent and in my opinion the CGI Hulk isnt as bad as some people make out.Overall I would say it is reasonable but could have been so much better,Shame

Ang Lee loses himself in wipe city,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. I know people have complained about the lack of action, but that really didn't bother me. I am interested in the psychology behind the characters and the depth at which that can be explored. No my main problem is with the ""stylistic"" choices made by Mr Lee, after an interesting visual opening that seemed to fit with introducing any kind of comic book movie it should have stopped there, but no Ang Lee decided it would be ""in keeping with comic book stylings"" to utilise frame breaking wipes and split screen action that is disorienting and sucks any drama from the film completely. The CGI was impressive, but not the best ever seen. So many plot points muddled into obscurity leaving far too many situations unexplained. Interesting character moments are opened and then not followed through, maybe this was the script or maybe it was the direction but whoever is to blame should be hauled out into the streets of south central Los Angeles and left to the social reprebates who inhabit that wonderfully violent area. While I eagerly anticipated this film, and got more excited as I heard about the areas that would be explored I left the cinema feeling as if I had been physically and emotionally assaulted by Messrs Lee and Shamus. Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly and the ever popular Sam Elliot were hoplessly wasted, as was the opportunity to show a visually startling transformation from man to rampaging green id. No marks out of ten for this one boys. To all those in the UK eagerly awaiting this movie, I suggest you don't bother wasting your money. This film is a template for what is wrong with the studio system in film making today. All bucks and no bang.",1.0,12 July 2003
A Flawed and enjoyable Comic book movie.,"Dr. Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) has been conducting experiments involving Gamma radiation, until one night while try to save a friend's life in the labs he accidentally gets hit by gamma rays. Banner survives however but soon he transforms into a large green indestructible brute called ""The Hulk"" who's real gentle inside but doesn't like it when someone or something gets him mad. General Ross (Sam Elliot) and Glenn Talbot (Josh Lucas) suspects something wrong is going on, Bruce's love Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) must try to help with Banner's problems and that's the same for Banner's long lost father David (Nick Nolte) who enhances himself with gamma radiation to become an Absorbing Man.

Enjoyable and slightly different Sci-fi action thriller based on a Marvel Comic Book created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby! Ang Lee (""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"") wanted to make the movie more of an artsy mainstream movie. The movie didn't do too well with all the hype back in 2003 with some audiences having mixed feelings especially some critics complaining that it was a little slow and didn't have much action. I thought the film was good but not great and not as bad as some people put out, i thought the film had some good casting like Connelly who is lovely as ever playing Ross and Eric Bana was a good choice playing Dr. Banner and i thought the special effects by ILM are nicely done even if the Hulk didn't look too realistic enough.

Ang Lee did try to get a major audiences but at least he tried, i'm sure the new sequel with Edward Norton should be an improvement over this movie and judging from the looks of the teaser to the second film Hulk now looks more realistic this time.",4.0,18 March 2008
Under rated movie,I came in to write the review after watching the movie again after 16+ years and seeing just 5+ rating for the movie. I read in 1 review that it got some bad press...dont know what that was but this movie might not have got good reviews coz it doesn't fit completely into any genre...not even dark movie genre. That said the storyline where a father risks his child's life by experimenting on him and then tries to kill him on seeing the dire consequences is a deeply emotional topic that only few would understand. And the desperate struggle of that child when he grows up and fights and tries to come to terms with the raging being within him..the rage against humanity and what greed has made humans into is something relevant now as well as since ages. Another big draw for me was the background score which I remembered since more than 16 years back when I first heard it. The VFX is top notch and I had heard from a friend who works in the industry that it took batteries of very high powered computers to generate many of the fight scenes. Recommended for people who like dark movies and for those who want to see something different from the regular Hollywood fare.,8.0,20 September 2020
"Pretty good, but a little messy","This was an interesting film, but messy. The plot was all over the place, and the effects were good, except of course the Hulk himself. A little to obvious with the CGI effects. I did like the comic book feel to the movie though. Suggested for fans of the Hulk. Nolte is great as always.",4.0,29 October 2003
When does it end,"This movie was quite possible the most boring movie that I have ever scene. First I would like to address that it takes and hour and a half before Bruce ever turns into the Hulk. This makes the movie that much worse. Second the action that takes place is cartoon action which leaves me very uninterested, not only that but the Hulk looks more a man in a giant rubber suit. Third Ang Lee directs and did some inventive things like makeing the shots more like a comic book which good but mostly confusing, not only that but I doubt that a Chinese man has ever seen let alone heard of The Hulk. The only good spot on this movie is that Stan Lee (creator of the Hulk) and Lou Ferrigno (The Hulk from the T.V. Show) make a cameo apperence. Beyond that this movie sucked I give a 1 this movie is not worth my time or money.",1.0,22 June 2003

"Some fun stuff, but mostly boring","My wife and I went to the hulk expecting another typical Hollywood check-your-brain-at-the-door action movie. We got that, but we also got all this extra character development. Why? I don't know. It wasn't interesting nor necessary for the development of the plot. We also got about 15 minutes of some really beautiful visuals. Salt flats, hoodoos, water, clouds, lichen on trees, lizards, sea-life, and much much more. But come on, 15 minutes worth?!?

After the first hour, things started to get moving, then we get a fifteen minute reprieve from anything that would keep us awake. Then, FINALLY, in the last half-hour of the movie things get fun.

There's some really clever stuff here. (The dogs were great.) There's also some pretty stupid stuff. (Dad's power? What animal did that come from?) The Hulk looks really really good. Hats off to the CG crew (and I've got on MSc in CG). Connely doesn't look half-bad either, and doesn't do a bad job of looking distraught and confused. But more than anything, this movie delivers a lot of boredom.

Shave half-an-hour of boring footage, rework Mr. Banner senior's power, throw in another Hulk rampage, and you'd have had a fun film. As is? Well, do yourself a favour and bring something to read.",5.0,25 June 2003
The Most Awesome Comic Book Movie,"I really do believe the people who reviewed this movie initially want to now eat their words when 7 years later this movie that they called trash turned out to be a complete masterpiece. This movie was made unlike any other movie before it and it was criticized by many who just couldn't grasp it and for a time I was one of those people.

What I didn't understand is that this move was not made to be watched only once. And that it had a level of depth to it that at first glance can't be seen. The unspoken words, that are said. The deep emotional reactions portrayed by the excellent cast, who might I add played their roles to perfection. The story and all the interesting ways the director uses different mediums to explain how it all began. This movie is in a class of its own. Not to mention the best use of CG in a superhero movie to date.(Yeah I said it to date) The animations the RAGE!!! the POWER!!! everything was in its place. Ang LEE is a master. If you disagree just watch the 2nd one with Edward Norton. No comparison complete garbage.

Oh yeah and I have to get this one in there Ang Lee's HULK was the real HULK. the second one was not. For those of you who don't read comics the HULK can grow to fifteen feet tall and can leap huge distances, who's strength has no limit. Let's look at the strongest men in the world, are they cut and ripped like Body Builders, hell no, so why then is the hulk all 'veiny' and ripped and small in the second Hulk. Ang Lee's Hulk is more convincing and powerful and more HULK than any other adaptation. I think Ang Lee laid a real solid foundation from which to build and Marvel could have used his foundation to surpass even Spiderman. But they messed up with Edward Norton. People went to see part two because of part one and they were terribly disappointed. When we should have gotten more we got less. Less everything. I think anyone who wants to see a real comic book movie should not look past this one. This is an awesome movie that like a fine wine only seems to get better with age.

And I am waiting on a real sequel to this movie, and I know that there are many others out there that feel the same way. Get Ang LEE and Eric Bana and the whole team back.",9.0,7 April 2010

The worse huge budget film since Armageddon,"I always thought that Ang Lee was an overrated director. Crouching tiger... didn't impress me much and Sense and sensibility bored me to the point where I fell to sleep in the theater watching it(Ice storm is his only great film). But still, his work is highly praised, Crouching... made a lot of money and Hollywood mogul's decided to give him 130mil.$ to make The Hulk. What he made is something that's so bad that it's hard to beleive,the worse 100mil.+ budgeted film since Armageddon. What Lee tried to do is a serious film about a man that turns in to a huge green monster when he gets angry,10 times his normal size,but still never loses his pants,they just stretch. In doing so, he made Nick Nolte deliver the worse role in his life and almost sealled Eric Bana's Hollywood carrier. The film itself is extremly boring, and when something interesting starts to happen Lee screwes it up with splitting the screen in 2,3,4 or even more small screeens simply because he had to be cool. Split screen worked in early De Palma's work, here it's just annoying. CGI is so-so,with such a huge budget it should have been much better.",3.0,26 July 2003
Not incredible,"From the terrible self important titles, to the really bad cameo from Stan Lee and the original Hulk, this movie is terribly obvious. And I don't say that lightly, because I think Ang Lee is a very talented filmmaker, but this is just nonsense. All the unnecessary transitions and CGI for no reason at all is almost a match for Eric Bana's uninspired performance. That terrible conversation between Eric and Jennifer is almost painful in the way only George Lucas dialogue can be.

Maybe it's the constant fighting that this movie is having within itself, trying to be true to the comic book, while trying to show the deepness of Bruce Banner, but really it does neither. Whether it's the redicoulesness of trying to make this story into something similar to the recent Batman movie, rather than a more hellboyesque movie that this should have been. This is a comic book story nothing more, and unfortunately there is no need to make it seem credible, just have some fun with it and let the green guy break some stuff.

Then when the big green bloke does finally start to break stuff, there is so much CGI that it's like watching a cartoon. All credibility that this movie had tried to build up, through Bruce's flash backs and the General crazy scientist angle is lost when we see a 4 minute scene where the green cartoon character is jumping across the desert.

Ang Lee lost the plot while making this movie, why try and make the inner struggle so important if your going to back it up with a cartoon character bouncing around like a clown. It doesn't make sense.

Hopefully Ang Lee and Eric Bana can make better movies than this in the future.

It really wasn't Incredibel in anyway.",3.0,3 August 2005
Geeky Randy's summary,"Forgettable superhero film exploring the origins of Bruce Banner (Bana), a genetics researcher who suffers a lab accident involving gamma radiation. The result: he has the capability of changing into a green-skinned monster when angry. The temper tantrums get him enough attention to be pursued by the United States military, but maybe the cast and crew should've pursued other projects. There's nothing much here except boredom and disappointment. While the film does have its moments and can be commended for its attempt at not being completely brainless, there is no payoff for an action film that doesn't have all that much action.

Good Actors Drown in Ridiculous Effects and Lousy Script,"There was a lot of rationalization about comic book fandom when it was announced that Ang Lee, with an expertise primarily in exquisite family films chose to direct ""Hulk.""

He chose excellent actors who strive for realistic emoting, and the family interactions, as uniquely dysfunctional as they are, were the most interesting to me -- though many in the audience kept shouting out during the exposition ""Bring on the Hulk already!""

A good portion of the plot is even told during the opening credits to try and get as much out of the way for such restless viewers as possible. Those folks seemed to like it when the Hulk finally does appear, but I thought its bounding CGI ridiculousness blew-up more than the furniture.

Three authors are credited for the screenplay, but I think that's probably just because that's the Writer's Guild maximum as this feels like the horse that was written by committee and turned out a camel, with almost desperate repeat references to King Kong. No one could actually say ""T'was beauty killed the beast."" so they could leave open the possibility of a sequel.

The flashback memories and contemporary confrontations with father Nick Nolte were interesting motivators, especially for the mostly non-verbal Hulk.

Funny how my reactions to the use of the military against the Hulk and his crushing of tanks and planes have gotten more complex since the current war as I now think of the young soldiers following orders who are inside, even if they are CGI too. I guess the Hulk should now be considered a WMD.

Just like the Bad Old Days,"Remember not so long ago, when almost every comic book turned movie was cringed at? The only people who would dare see them without plenty of reassurance would be the die hard comic fans, who would love the movie no matter what? Well sadly, The Hulk is a big step backward from recent releases and takes the genre back to those very days.

The acting and story are extremely over the top. What's worse is all seems like it's in the wrong dang movie. If a very few select scenes were removed, you'd be hard pressed to even call this sci-fi much less The Hulk. It's yet another pseudo-intellectual flick trying to be more than it is and failing miserably. I'm so sick of movies using cheesy editing and over the top acting and dialog to beg the audience to believe it's saying something intelligent. Intelligence doesn't require gimmicks.

Hulk is by far too nice and friendly to be the Hulk. In one scene, he's peacefully sitting in the desert looking at flowers. No rage, no anger, nothing. Yet, he's still Hulk. The only good CGI scene in this entire flick is a helicopter battle in the desert. Sadly, even that's pretty much ruined by constant cries of ""I'm okay!!"" over the radio so our Hulk stays a good boy.

This entire movie is cliché rips from anything and everything, but barely including the comic in that list. The stereotypical General, the genius criminal without access to a comb in his life, the vanilla hero, even the nosy won't shut the heck up girlfriend. If this obsessive daddy's girl could mind her own freaking business for a half a millisecond, maybe Hulk boy wouldn't be so stressed!",1.0,23 June 2003
It's Not That Bad!,"""Hulk"" was widely anticipated as a release, and it disappointed most people. Why? The characters are very uneven, the plot is confusing, the effects are every strange, and the storyline is so far-fetched that it's ridiculous. Still, it's not as bad a film as everyone says.

I won't bother summarizing the film. If you don't know the story by now, you probably never will. Eric Bana plays the Hulk/Bruce Banner, and I found that he does a fine job. My only problem is that he seems kind of blank and dull at times, and has no real distinctive personality. His evil father (nick Nolte) sold me right away however, with his creepiness and evil look. Talk about a frightening villain! The best performance of the film comes from the underrated Jen Connelly. She is fantastic as Betty, bringing some much-needed emotion into the story. They needed an Oscar-winner, and she gave them one. The plot is the real problem. Though we get some very cool action scenes and such, some moments are ridiculously bizarre, and i found myself confused at times. For that reason, I didn't love the film, but I liked it just fine for what it's worth. I'd recommend it to younger teens more than anyone else.",5.0,7 June 2007

Better than the second.,"I write this after seeing the second. The first iteration of the Hulk series is much better than the second. The acting and interaction between characters is better with more feeling. The hulk is much truer to form in this the first movie than the terribly nicknamed re-boot which is a stupid nickname. Very good character development and though action is somewhat delayed it tears into an awesome display of strength and power.

Watch the 2nd one then watch the first and you'll see what I mean.

I was on the edge of my seat in the first one in many of the scenes and was thoroughly entertained.

The representation of the Hulk monster is much more comic book like and truer in the 1st than in the 2nd.",8.0,12 July 2008
Not even a good rental,"Garbage. After 1.5 hours, I thought it was over...I *hoped* it was over. Anyway, it then dragged on for another miserable hour. Even the special effects don't redeem this one. Comic-book fans will be disappointed, others will likely leave early.",3.0,22 June 2003
"Yep, it's as awful as it looks","Being a marvel comic collector all of my childhood, I was eager to see this film when I first heard about it. And then, over the course of many months, we were fed trailers that revealed more and more of the Hulk's rendering with each subsequent trailer. If you were like me, you cringed at each of these trailers, as it seemed apparent, even in what little they showed of the Hulk, that the computer generated results were terrible. But after all, realism isn't everything, especially in a fantastic and fictional storyline. After all, King Kong is still a highly entertaining classic with a good storyline, and nobody would ever mistake the stop motion in that film for a real gorilla. So I decided to shrug off the less than satisfying animation that was briefly revealed in the trailers and go see the film anyway. I'm sorry I did.

The first half of the film was fairly engaging, as the plot started to unfold and you're left wondering where it will lead to (other than the obvious and eventual transformation). But then you wait...and wait...and wait..., and finally we get the first transformation, aka the emergence of the title character. And then it's obvious, without a shadow of a doubt, that the animation is terrible. (anyone who's impressed with the visuals must think Gumby's a masterpiece of animation as well). The movement isn't fluid, and I've seen better work in Playstation games. Fine, if that's the way it's gonna be then at least we have some good acting and a good plot to carry it along, right? Wrong. While I did enjoy Sam Elliot's and Nick Nolte's performances, the leads are incredibly stiff with no chemistry at all. And the plot doesn't go anywhere, except for a last minute after thought to inject an arch villian into the climax, which ends up being just about the most anti-climactic finale I've seen in along time.

About the only positive comment I can make about the film is that it appears that Ang Lee at least tried to do a different kind of superhero film, and while many have stated that the multiple split screen shooting style was annoying, I at least found it an interesting and unique way to show a scene. Problem is, do we really need to see 5 multiple camera angles of a scene when there's nothing going on in the first place?

IMO, the worst offering in the Marvel film series yet.",2.0,20 June 2003
Cardboard,"I'm amazed that so much money can be spent to create such a low quality movie. Unless you can watch a movie solely for its special effects, you'll be disappointed. The plot was uninspired, inconsistent and often making little sense (especially later on). Though there were some decent actors, cheesy lines made many scenes hard to watch. Throughout strange transitions and split screens were used, presumably in an attempt to capture the feel of a comic, but rarely added anything and were mostly gratuitous. The fight sequences were well done because of impressive computer graphics, but hardly make the movie worth seeing.

"Limited action, action movie","I did not enjoy this movie. The seat began to feel uncomfortable half way through, and that's not good. There were a number of problems with this movie.

It simply took too long to start. The story leading to the action was just too long. Hulk, the comic hero! I expected an action movie with some supporting story. This was a story with some supporting action.

The story was implausible. It is not clear why there was hostility against the father. And even when the truth was finally revealed, why it intensified.

His father wasn't evil, well not initially anyway. It is not clear why he became evil. It seemed out of character for him to send the dogs or even possible to mutate the dogs to that state. (Isn't a generation needed?)

During the Hulk's great escape, it was said that fighting made him more angry and made him fight more. The to catch him was to calm him down. `The Girl' was used to this effect. When this father became a ball of energy, supplying more energy seemed to destroy him, not make him stronger. And the whole fight between the Hulk and father made no sense. It was nonsense, and that was the good part of the movie.

WARNING: Children will be Bored to Death with this Film,"Whatever you do, don't take children to see this movie. I took a bunch of 4th graders to see Hulk, and halfway through the film, they demanded to leave the theater. They weren't the only kids that couldn't stand this film. I saw many other kid walk outs. Another class of kids was in the theater with us, and they actually left before we did.

So I am just warning everyone here, if you think Hulk is some kind of cartoon kiddie friendly movie, you are sorely wrong. Children will be put to sleep with the Hulk. This movie is VERY SLOW, and extremely dull and meandering. The lumbering pace bored many adults, so I can understand why so many kids hated this movie.",1.0,23 June 2003
A missed opportunity,"Don't get me wrong, this is a decent movie. But when I close my eyes and think of what the Hulk could have been the film can't help be a disappointment. My first introduction to the Hulk was in the late 70's, hiding behind the sofa as Lou Ferringo smashed through wall after polystyrene wall and ran about in slow motion. I was terrified! There are some reasons this film was not a classic.

1) Miscast - Bana was too confident, strong and good looking. Where was his angst and when he did get angry it was more like indigestion. I have seen a few Robert Downey Jnr films recently and his demons are never far from the surface. He would be the perfect choice for a sequel and closer to the Bixby mould.

2) The Hulk - The Hulk was always meant to be a manifestation of Banner's child-like ID. Pure rage that Banner couldn't show. I always imagined him as a kind of bullying older brother, who has no time for you, but nonetheless will step in on your behalf even though he is disgusted by your weakness. The Hulk hates Banner but this was never evident. In addition, he looked more like a wrestler then a monster of rage. I wanted the Hulk to be frightening with rippled sinew not a big galoot with soft eyes.

3) The transformation - now that was silly. It made the TV show look better crafted and the in the movie the change looked like someone inflating a dinghy. I loved the sound of the change in the TV show as it made the hairs on my neck stand up...still does. There was a simultaneously horrific foreboding and thrill as the eyes changed and the sound effect was heard for the first time. Banner and the Hulk were wrestling for control. I wanted it to be more Dr Jeykll I'm afraid. Sometimes lashings of CGI don't cut it. We are often more entertained and scared by what we can't see.",4.0,27 November 2005
Much better than expected,"I had no expectations when I started watching this film, and I must admit I have not read many of the comics.

The film develops the story about how The Hulk became The Hulk quite in detail and develops the characters. The characters have quite Marvel-like standards, the general with his well-cut mustache, and the sweet girl with all the characteristics of a lovely American girl.

It's not just about smashing things and the cgi, the viewer gets to know the reasons behind all this, and why The Hulk is so angry. This is why I almost could recommend this to my wife as well, it's not just a movie for teens.

Quite enjoyable, thought about the film even the next day. :)",8.0,7 September 2008
"Long, Slow and Not Green Enough","The film seemed very long and slow to get going.

There isn't really enough action to appeal to me on that level. The love interest isn't very interesting or fully developed, but at least there is the beautiful Jennifer Connelly. There is considerable time spent developing the ""back story"" of Bruce Banner's father, but somehow that story doesn't even produce any real drama. It seems to me that the movie spends too much time setting up for a sequel that I have no interest in seeing.

On a positive note, the effects are very good and ""believable"", for a comic book character and story

I was right about the directing, it was unique.... and it sucked!!!!!!! Ang Lee did a terrible job directing this film with all the split screen crap and countless other parts. i wasnt even impressed with the action, there was one scene that was decent. i thought the acting was cheesy and there were some stupid parts. i was bored the entire movie. overall this movie is a 2 out of 10 stars in my opinion.

A super hero movie with feelings! The horror.. the horror..,"Sometimes people disappoint me so hard it's almost depressing. I think one of the reasons this movie has such a bad reputation is the mouth-to-mouth effect. One person says it sucks a** and people go see it with that in mind. Many might even ""secretly"" like it, but because so many others say it sucks, they don't dare to admit that they actually love it. I know, because I used to be like that. You've got mail? Sleepless in Seattle? ""Sentimental tacky crap!"".. well now I know better. As a guy and a filmbuff I'm no-longer in any way ashamed to say I actually love those films.

The Hulk is a great movie. It's obvious this film is maybe not as heavy on action as say Daredevil or X2. Why is that such a big problem?! I can almost hear the redneck college jocks in the back row going ""Dude, this sucks. Let's hit the road and go show our six-packs to hot chicks!"". As it was expected, director Ang Lee made a movie with real feelings, but there actually IS also lots of action to go around. As far as the performances are concerned, all is in place. Bana pulls off another class A job and Nolte has really outdone himself. And although Connelly is good too, her job is merely to be worried about Banner.

If you haven't seen Hulk yet, give it a shot, but try to forget all the hype surrounding it. Start with a clean slate. It might disappoint you or you might love it. At least your opinion won't be based on others.

Worst Movie In History,"My title speaks for itself. In no way what so ever was this screenplay smart, or clever. The cinematography and special effects are amateur at best, and the acting was horrendous. The great director Ang Lee might have ruined any chance he has of directing another potentially great superhero film.

1/10 I would have given it 0 but I'm a nice guy, and i have to admit, there was only one part of the movie i liked, and if you are an extreme movie goer like me, you will know which part.

I loved it!,"I can say that most critics are WRONG anyway, and most of the time I agree with them. But in this case, they are absolutely backwards on their critique. I had the pleasure of going into the theatre with an open mind, saying to myself, ""expect the worse, don't fall asleep, etc,etc."" I watched the credits, and thus begins the story. I was amazed and glued to my seat. Slow?, I dont think so. This is a STORY that gives you the character and you fall right in. I liked the story line, Nick Nolte is absolutely brilliant, Jennifer is excellent as an understanding girlfriend, and Sam is the distant father we all know. I cant find anything wrong with this movie, at all. It wasn't corny, no stupid trick photography, and the Hulk has limits, this is the way it should be. He stumbles at times being so BIG, and screams with anger as anyone would. I LIKE this movie. I hope to see another soon, and as far as the Matrix Reloaded, I also liked it and compared to the first, I HATED the first. Excellent work Mr. Ang Lee.

The vision of Ang Lee,"I didn't find Hulk so well. Story is not so deep even if the movie is quite long. This is not necessarily bad to spend time to settle characters and story but here, it's sometimes boring. Actually Hulk takes a long time before really starting whereas the ending is quite expeditious and the final battle is a great disappointment. Acting is okay but not amazing except Nick Nolte whose way of playing is in osmosis with his character in the movie.

The most interesting in the movie, and which seems to me very positive, is that we get the vision of an author : Ang Lee. He gives us how he see the Hulk and his story. Despite i think a lot of obligations and difficulties linked to the adaptation of comic books, Lee seemed to have a great freedom to make this movie. He tried many things, imposed his style and has made action scenes which are sometimes great and not set like a movie clip. Finally, i didn't really like the movie but i truly respect the work of Ang Lee as he didn't made a formated movie. 5/10.",5.0,4 July 2003
Could have been better,"First of all...the first 30 minutes are the strongest in the entire film....despite a strong performance from Jennifer Connelly the show is a steaming pile of vomit. Ang Lee has tried to make the film more like a comic book than a movie, this frustrated me alot. Ang should have kept it simple. There was no story line at all, apart from the from the fact the american military trying to be heros. There were scenes in the film that include the dog fight and most of the the hulk running through the desert which were totally unnessicery and the movie probably would have been 30 minutes shorter without them. That would have brought it to around the 1 hour 35 minute mark, more than enough for a film of that caliber. I just wanted to get up and leave but felt compelled to see how they left way for a sequel. In saying that i wasn't missing much. The ending to the film was shot totally in CGI and in total darkness. I couldn't see what was going on. im not sure weather this was the movie or the cinema i was in but everything else seemed to be fine. The only redeeming feature was the ""curious chemistry"" between Connelly and Bana. I don't know weather they were trying to imitate the chemistry in spiderman between maguire and dunst because there are only a handfull of scenes where they both come in contact with each other but these few meetings somehow pave way to creating a more believeable story. Maybe the hulk coming in contact with Betty Ross calmed the animal within him and made him come across as more man than beast. David Banner came across as a weak character helped by terrible dialouge. Noltes acting was alright but due to this dialouge problem he came across as a little bit muddled as to weather he loved he loved or hated his own son.

"AWFUL, BORING, AND WAY TOO LONG","This movie SUCKED! I hated it. Don't waste your time! It was awful!

Now let me support my feelings against this movie! The characters were not properly motivated. It seems that is the main problem with a lot of movies these days. Screen writers are having a difficult time keeping the characters motivated. For example, the Hulk's dad, Mr. Banner, sends his mutant dogs to attack Hulk's girlfriend FOR NO REASON AT ALL! People were in the theatre going, ""Why is he trying to kill her?"" That part of the movie made no sense. Then that blond guy from the weapons lab barges in to Banner's house while he is under ARMED guard, and physically attacks him for NO REASON. Meanwhile, the armed guards stand around uselessly and do nothing. Another problem, they kept capturing the Hulk and putting him in lock down. And each time, Sam Elliot would do a horrible job over acting and scream, ""NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO INTERACT WITH BANNER! HE IS TO REMAIN CONFINED UNTIL THE END OF HIS NATURAL LIFE!"" Then, IMMEDIATELY, someone would be allowed to interact with Banner and make him mad, then he would turn in to the Hulk. Off the top of my head, this happened no less than THREE TIMES in the course of the movie.

Of course, that part of the movie came at GREAT LENGTH! It took FOREVER for the Hulk to finally show up. They shouldn't have called this movie ""THE HULK,"" they should have called it, ""THE LONG BORING WAIT FOR THE HULK TO APPEAR."" People in the theatre around me were LITTERALLY shouting at the screen, ""Where is the Hulk?"" One man told his daughter, ""Don't fall asleep baby, the Hulk is coming."" It was PATHETIC! I hated this movie!

As if all this was not insult enough, Nick Nolte's weird character of Banner Senior was really stupid. At the end, he gains the power to become ""ANYTHING MAN."" This means, anything he touches, he can become. So, at the end, they have Banner chained up in front of a big microwave, and they say, ""No one go near him. If he so much as moves, we will kill him!"" Then, they IMMEDIATELY let Nick Nolte go over and start provoking him! Nick Nolte is CHAINED UP, and the whole scene was a like a bad college play. Then Nick bites in to an electrical cable and becomes Electricity Man. Then he fights the Hulk and becomes Water Man. Yes, the movie is actually as stupid as I am making it sound.

This movie sucked SUPER BAD. I hated it! I am getting angry just thinking about it, and you wont like it when I am angry! I dont like it when movies SUCK! JAKE SMASH! HULK TRASH!

Avoid this stupid, boring movie at all costs. I rate it a ZERO on a scale of 1 to 10.

The only good thing is being able to look at the beautiful Jennifer Connelly. She is SUPER HOT! The movie should have been about her. All the shots should have been of her, doing anything. That would have been INFINITELY more entertaining than this green pile of waste!",1.0,23 June 2003

Maybe it did and I just started having flashbacks.... but whatever that was for the last 20 minutes it wasn't making any sense at all. Perhaps the scriptwriters couldn't decide on how to finish out the movie so they went into the desert with some reality altering substances decided to put it to film.

Bad!,"I just watched the movie last night with a couple friends and we literally walked out of the theater laughing. Actually, the laughter started about 20 minutes before the end of the movie.

-The ending was incomprehensibly terrible.

-The main plot was horribly boring and melodramatic. Which was no fault of the actors, the screenplay is to blame.

-The departures from the storyline of the original comic were puzzling. The movie could have been much better had it simply followed the original comics. It always amazes me when moviemakers refuse to use the rich storylines available in the comic books. After all, it was those storylines that made the comics popular in the first place. Perhaps being more faithful to the comics is what made Spiderman and X-men such great adaptations.

-On the positive side, at least most of the action sequences were pretty entertaining, which is ironic because I was afraid they were going to be the worst part.

As a comic book fan from years back, this is the worst Marvel based comic book movie I have seen, and that's coming from someone who saw Daredevil.

Ambitious but ultimately dissatisfying film version of the Marvel comic.,"There are some moments of excitement in HULK, an introspective adaptation of Marvel Comics hero The Hulk. One has the big green smashing machine fighting three monster hulk-dogs, including what may be the screen's first monster French Poodle. But the film's most intriguing scene has the ultimate in human rage fighting instruments of mechanized warfare, represented by several attack helicopters. It is the 21st century battle of the angry man versus machine. But the moments of real excitement are kept to a minimum for too long in this film. Until the final third, the film is overly self-conscious and introspective as if Lee, in trying to bring more to the comic book story, lost the original vital essence. This is a film about rage turning a man into a monster and the audience needs to feel rage or they cannot participate in the experience.

Berkeley scientist Bruce Banner (played by Eric Bana) does bio-medical research. He struggles with the fact he cannot remember his early childhood. He gets his clues in dreams which keep prodding him with images from a past trauma which has cauterized his memories of the past. Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) works with him and strangely also contends with her own images from the past.

Bruce believes himself to be an orphan, but somewhere close by lurks his father David Banner (played by Nick Nolte and in flashbacks by Paul Kersey). His father did something just awful with biomedical discoveries. We never find out exactly what it was, but it left a legacy in Bruce's genes which when combined with strong radioactivity turns him a pastel green, inflates him like a Macy's float, and allows him to disregard walls and ceilings when he moves his huge bulk around. Betty's father (Sam Elliot) is an Army general. He knows that some powerful, weapon- related hocus-pocus is going on. and the Army has left him in charge of making sure America gets it first.

This all sounds like it a little more fun than it actually turns out to be. The problem is the film is so dark and so slow to unfold. It takes too long a time to unravel what the mystery incident was even in a film a langurous 136 minutes in length. In fact, we never actually learn the full story. We never even understand exactly what all the scientific research is all about. Equally strange is why General Ross is given such a free hand to handle the situations he faces in the film. His occasional ineptitude is so obvious that it telegraphs action well before it happens. He also is inept in his relations with his daughter as part of the two dysfunctional parent-child relationships that support the plot structure. Lee maintains a subdued tone, trying at times to be deep and psychological and even verge on the pseudo- mystical. The Danny Elfman score is not his usual fare but neither is it greatly notable.

There are at least two questions that the film version brings to mind. Bruce Banner seems to have something like 75 kilograms of mass. He at least triples his volume when he becomes the Hulk. Doesn't this make him rather fluffy rather than strong? Certainly it leaves the question of where he gets his strength.

Even more intriguing is the question of how his pants manage to continue to fit his midsection after it expands to several times its size without ripping out the seams. The place where his pre- expansion clothing would naturally be the tightest would be his waistline. His pants would rip first instead of being the only thing that survives. Lee seems to remember this detail in one or two scenes, at one point showing an elastic waistline, but usually he ignores it, hoping it will not be noticed.",2.0,4 January 2006

Hooray for Super Stretchy Lycra Shorts!,"I thought The Hulk was an amazing movie.

I nominate it for First Prize in all movie awards in the `Make-Up and Special Effects' category for the most stunning effect in the whole movie: Eric Banna/Bruce Banner's Super Stretchy Lycra Shorts!

I grew up with Lou Ferrigno's Hulk and it was a wonderful surprise catching his cameo.

Even though I never read The Hulk comics, I greatly appreciated the added color (apart from green!) brought to the movie by the comic book style `split screens, wipes, fades, and boxes'. The story told by the movie shows a warm compassion for my favourite main characters, Eric Bana (Bruce Banner), Jennifer Connelly (Betty Ross), Sam Elliott (Betty's Military Dad) and Nick Nolte (Bruce's Father - a most satisfying anti-hero).

The Hulk effects were very exciting on the big screen, and it fit perfectly with the efforts made to fill in the story of Bruce and his father.

I was getting a tad restless in some parts towards the end of the movie when the energy of the film starts to slide a bit, but I was just too hyped from the action scenes!

My favourite scene: watching Eric Banna's charismatic face made huge, green and angry and then sad, lost, confused and somewhat love struck by the tender face of Jennifer Connelly (Betty Ross). (For some reason, it reminded me of a very funny Eric Bana in Channel 10's Full Frontal - used to be on Australian TV 1992 to 1994.)

Disappointing film of 2003 (so far),"OK, I admit. I saw the Hulk on my computer. It was a pretty good bootleg. I sat there expecting to see the type of super hero flick just like Spider Man or Daredevil. But I sat in front of the computer for 2 hours and saw a film with such a great story, drag before my very eyes. The Hulk had a great story and the direction of Ang Lee was perfect. I wanted to see more action. You don't advertise a film with such eye candy. You are going to get the dollars but you will have the audience disappointed. The point is that the Hulk had no real action what so ever. The scenes with the Hulk in the commercial, are the only scenes you see the Hulk at his prime. The Hulk isn't the only movie to succumb to lack of entertainment. Men in Black 2 was supposed to be my favorite summer of 2002. MIB 2 turned to be corny. Queen of the Damned made money because of Aaliyah's name, not the quality. She was only in 2 minutes of the friggin' movie!!!!!!!!!! But anyway, the Hulk gets one star for the direction of Ang Lee and a star and a half for the interesting story.

Misguided attempt at deep comic book Hulking pathos,"Unlike the contemporary Spider-Man films (2002 & 2004) and, to nearly the same extent, the X-Men films (2000 & 2003), this 2003 effort misses the mark as far as finding the core element which made this monsterish super-hero a big success for over 40 years. In cases such as these, it always begs the question: what made the filmmakers believe they were smarter than forty years of p r o v e n success? Ego maybe? Much of this fault (besides the screenwriters) lies with director Lee, who fixated on odd patterns (son-father relations, terrain, comic book panel ambiance) instead of the power emanating from pure rage unleashed. The old TV series ('78-'82) captured this essence better, despite budget limitations that restricted epic storytelling. The fact is, the scenes of the Hulk raging are rather flat and uninspired. Ang Lee himself, as revealed behind-the-scenes, stepped in to use motion-capture computer technology to map out the Hulk's movements; he might've been better off using a professional mime or actor. The story drifts off-course early on, switching to Berkeley, CA as the locale for Banner's life (before first Hulking-out) when it should have remained in the eerie desert. It then re-introduces the main villain, Banner's father, and pretty much makes him the main character. I can't fault Nolte's performance as a mad scientist, but he belongs in another picture. Towards the end, he's transformed into this movie's version of Marvel Comics long-time villain The Absorbing Man, just one of the plot diversions that occur for no reason other than the writer was bored and didn't know what else to do. The Hulk's first appearance is in the dark and I suspect this was done to cover-up unconvincing computer FX. Later, he grows in size from bullet impacts - again, a plot twist deviating from the character to, what, let the animators show off a larger Hulk? In the final act, the military (the one aspect from the comics they got right) lets the two super-powered beings sit together (again, because the writer was at a loss) and stand back to watch until they both explode into final battle. I don't pretend to understand the strategy there. Oh, and I haven't even mentioned the 3 dogs, yet. With several good villains to choose from (Leader, Abomination,etc.) the filmmakers choose to have the Hulk scrap with three mutated mutts, including a poodle. Maybe they were saving better foes for the sequel. Never save the good stuff for a film which may never happen.",4.0,17 July 2005
"Fantastic is what comes to mind, Best Comic Book film since Spider-man.","Oh, wow. I went into this movie with huge expectations..which is usually a bad idea, but man did this movie Deliver, on so many levels.

First off, FINALLY a movie over the 2 hour mark. I thought I could only rely on Lord of the Rings and Star Wars to give me that. Character Development, Emotional story, and of course..Hulk smashing.

Although, not too much Hulk Smashing. I doubt though kids will be pleased with the movie, out of its 2 hour and 20 minute running time, only about 20 minutes of that are action.

This didnt bother me any since the movie was done so well, but indeed it will probably make the kids squirm a bunch. I absolutely love the split screen comic book like useage, Just like pages from one of the books. Excellent.

Is this movie better than X2? IMO..Absolutely.

I liked X2 alot, but the action scenes were way too short, Stryker was probably the most boring villian Ive seen in a movie, granted the character development was great, but when the first 5 mins of a movie own the rest of the film..somthing is wrong.

But anyway, about Hulk..Yeah, Great movie, enjoyed it a ton.

One thing I'm really appreciative of, Jack Kirby and Stan Lee being credited around the start of the end credits in big letters, rather than a small spec of a section at the end.

On the whole, it's a really impressive movie. The harsh reviews I'm reading are not only unfair, but just uncalled for an innacurate.

A terrible film,"I was looking forward to another great marvel superhero film, perhaps not as brilliant as Spiderman or X-men 2 but good like Fantastic 4 when I bought this. I had heard it had bad reviews and it was slow but I thought what do critics know. I saw it and was appalled. It was boring, with little action and what action their was disappointing. I only saw the film all the way through so that I could say I had seen it and express my views of how bad it is.

The film had bad story that was slow and didn't make me care about the characters and just made me think most 10 year bolds could have given a better plot. The direction and editing of the film look awful with ridicules camera angles and a comic book style screen that was a joke.

Not only was it a bad film but its science couldn't even pretend to be good. If you watch X2 their (as a geneticist) some big mistakes but you don't care because it is a fantastic film, but the mistakes in the Hulk are not covered up by such a thing. To start off with the opening of the film set in 1966 had someone using a genetic technique not invented until 1975 and that was only the start. I wont bore you with the details but this wouldn't normally be a problem unless the film bored me so much.

Bad story, direction, science (even for a sci fi) and I don't think anyone should have to watch this. Just re-watch Spiderman 2 or something.",1.0,5 January 2006
You might not like it when it's anglee,"I'm very pleased that Ang Lee got his hands on the directing job for a multi-million dollar superhero flick. The idea of a very intelligent man handling the camera on a film for a Marvel hero is an excellent idea. Unfortunately, I don't speak for everyone. As a reviewer, I speak from personal enjoyment and predict if audiences will enjoy the film or not. Hulk is how a superhero film should be done. But due to the impatient public and the risk factors involved in trying to accomplish such a project it can be very difficult and that's why some think it's better to opt out of the decision to smarten up the formula.

At the time of its release, Hulk was open to mixed reviews and a ho-hum box office performance. After a solid opening weekend, it began experiencing sharper declines every week and eventually faded into the dust. In 2008, the character got a reboot in a film called The Incredible Hulk. That one ""solved"" all the ""problems"" with this film by making the story focus less on the talking and more on the mindless, droning action sequences.

To be fair, both have an ideal amount of charm. Even though the 2008 version was dubbed a ""reboot,"" I consider it more of a ""revival."" The only reason it was made was because of fan's disappointment with this adaptation. This one is for the backstory lovers like myself. The Incredible Hulk is for the ""less talky, more shooty"" type. I think it also tried to focus more on the Television series, where as this tries to be faithful to the comic book.

The story revolves around Bruce Banner, who is played by Corey Feldman lookalike Eric Bana. Bruce's father, David, has mutant DNA and realizes that when his wife gave birth to his son that he passed it on. At a young age, Bruce was taken from his family after his father caused an explosion at the lab he was employed at and his memories of his biological parents are unknown.

Years later, Bruce is a graduate from Berkeley working as a researcher in the field of nanomeds with his ex-girlfriend Betty Ross (Connelly). One night, Bruce encounters radiation exposure by accident while working on an experiment. Being that he already has mutant DNA, the encounter with the radiation creates an antagonistic effect on his body. Thus, when angry, now turns him into a raging green monster known as the Hulk.

The green guy doesn't show up until the forty minute mark, and the first fight scene happens a little after an hour. The first half an hour or so is strictly backstory and character development. Like it should be, in my opinion. When we finally see the monster about a third of the way in, Ang Lee is smart to keep the fighting minimal. The fight scenes are well choreographed and make sense because of the story given. I'm so very tired of films like Transformers that feel the need to throw in a random, explanation free fight scene between two metal monstrosities for no apparent reason. And to carry the scene on for over an hour is painfully overdoing it. Ang Lee's Hulk is the most tolerable superhero movie in a long time because of its pacing and extreme care for the characters and the source material they're from.

Is it boring? Sometimes. But in a strange way. Like, I'd rather see a different setup than an action scene. Some of the dialog is a bit hokey and hard to decipher, but since when has genetics ever been a simple concept? Thankfully, some of the dialog scenes on the subject of mutant DNA and genetics is kept to a minimum. Still, I'd favor that over mind-numbing nonsense any day.

Hulk himself is somewhat impressive. But the attention to detail, even in the poster with the giant hand careening towards you, is exquisite in its presentation. The creature himself is motion capture, meaning we have new, unpolished technology in the making. His appearance is nice for the time, but two years later Peter Jackson's King Kong established motion capture can be used very nicely. The Hulk character is more of a special effects experiment than anything, and for that reason he flounders between the level of acceptable and mediocre.

Ang Lee's art direction, complimented by Danny Elfman's music, also deserves some praise. Lee has somehow made an ugly, devilish green monster appealing. Most likely because we don't see him looking eye to evil-eye with the camera very often. We see his emotional side along with his destructive actions. Also, there are some very experimental editing techniques used. Obviously, the editor was aiming for a comic book style appearance. It works for the most part. The picture and picture style doesn't come off as obtrusive, mainly because it is used to enhance the experience - not to turn it into a gimmick.

Hulk is a film that may or may not please fans of the comic book. In the field of action, it doesn't hold up. But when the action scenes do come around they're nicely done in the sense that they don't make too much unclear. The dialog scenes, for the most part, are well thought out and well executed mainly because of the cast's great chemistry. This is what you call a superhero movie for people who could care less about superhero movies.

"Dang, Ang!",,8.0,22 June 2019
Worse than bad,"In a nutshell, Ang Lee can't direct, the film is poorly photographed, terribly edited and no one can act except Nick Nolte. One of the great things about the TV series was that Bruce Banner (Bill Bixby) was a very appealing character and you got to know him and his ideas. In this film Eric Bana can't act, and you never get know Bruce Banner, at all. Even Bruce Banner doesn't get to know Bruce Banner. He doesn't even know he's Bruce Banner until three-quarters of the way thought the film, if that.

This film is filled with a lot of rage (not including all those in the audience watching it and wanting their money back). Almost every character is extremely angry, except Jennifer Connelly who plays the same type of subdued (or should I say somnolent) role she did in `A Beautiful Mind.'

The movie is extremely incoherent down to the amateurish and lose-end directing of Ang Lee. He makes several film-school mistakes that take the audience out of the narrative, little that there is of it. The first thirty minutes are worthless, and should have been cut and replaced by 45-seconds of narrative exposition. There's so little development with the villain, his demise is anti-climatic.

this film is an insult to The Hulk, Marvel Comics and all their fans. the storyline is appalling and the acting awful.

the only positive points i can make about the film is there are lots of explosions in one small section of the film. but is that really worth going to the cinema for, let alone buying a copy.

in conclusion i highly recommend you avoid this film. but if you are a massive fan and you must see it, then get someone else to pay for it.",2.0,14 August 2005
My Humble Opinion,"OK, so I'll start off saying that I like most everyone involved with this film, so it's not that I'm bashing any of them personally. Basically though this movie is as mundane as can be. It just seems that since there was no push to make him a superhero in the sense that he fights evil for the betterment of the world, there just isn't much going on. Dialogues seem disjointed and conflict seems constructed. Basically it all boils down to a predictable family drama which is more about the Bruce's father than about his Hulk-ishness. I would be fine with this except it was pretty lame. The climax which we waited over 2 hrs for lasts only like 5 minutes and it's hard to even tell what's going on. And, the edits from scene to scene and the frame splits are so annoying. I mean, I understand Lee wanted it to look like a comic but 1. comic panels do not just portray varying angles of the same scene and 2. leave that alone! it's what's great about comics and really can never be transferred to film anyway. I'm not saying it was terrible, that I hate that I wasted my life like that. It was fine, just something I don't care to see ever again. So that's it, I predict it will do well this weekend and then taper off. The onslaught of mediocre comic films needs to stop, or at least they should turn their sights to more complex comic narratives like Watchmen and Dark Knight Returns, unless they're going to butcher them of course.",5.0,20 June 2003
The Incredible Flawed Movie,"Hulk tells the story of Dr. Bruce Krenzler (he's been adopted. His biological father is David Banner), a scientist at Berkely Labs working on Gamma radiation, which will help people heal faster and better. One day something goes terribly wrong and he is exposed to deadly amounts of Gamma radiation. To everyone's surprise, he doesn't die, but a strange man who's been lurking around the lab, who just happens to be Bruce's real father, warns him of something that may occur. Whenever Bruce feels threatened or enraged, he mutates into a green behemoth bent on destruction. While this makes for an okay action film, Ang Lee's directing style completely ruins the experience.

This movie isn't for fans of the comic book or for fans of the TV show. So much of the story has been changed around that the Hulk doesn't even seem like the same character. Ang Lee took liberties from the character that weren't necessary at all. The entire back story of Bruce's father being a mad scientist that altered his son's DNA with something that the Gamma rays ended up triggering for Bruce to become the Hulk is ridiculous. The entire story is flawed. The other problem is that the movie has a running length of nearly 2 and a half hours, and most of that time is spent up with sappy drama, and not enough action. Basically, Ang Lee went nuts over getting a good story and ended up ruining the film completely. I think the biggest problem is his direction style. He tried to do a good thing by making the movie look like a comic book, but it ended up destroying the experience. His use of distracting and annoying split screens constantly throughout the movie start to get irritating. There is one redeeming quality. The scene where the Hulk breaks out of a military facility and proceeds to destroy tanks and helicopters is a great action sequence that might please fans of the comic. If that was the whole movie, it might get a 9/10 from me. Unfortunately, that's not the case.

Not even the acting is very good. Eric Bana is wooden and silly as Bruce Banner, and he just comes off as a bit of an idiot. Jennifer Connelly is also wooden as Banner's love interest Betty Ross. Nick Nolte gives the worst performance of his career in this movie. I almost have to wonder if Nick Nolte was drunk every time he was filming. The only performance I really liked was Josh Lucas as Talbot, the scheming scientist desperate to trap the Hulk for his own agenda.

Overall, it was shoddy acting and directing that ruined this film, because with the special effects involved, it had huge potential.

"The Angrier the Hulk got, the cooler the Hulk got!","It's amazing how short a time it has taken for many a comic-reading fan to get jaded about movies base on comics. It wasn't so long ago that we had no comics-based movies to moan and whine about. Now that we've been treated to an impressive string of quality comics-based films, the nitpicking has begun. So the CGI isn't totally convincing, but how in the heck do you make a 2-ton, green behemoth realistic looking? It's just not possible given that we have no frame of reference to compare it to in the real world. So sit back and run with the fantasy. It's just a movie! And a great one at that!",9.0,21 June 2003
Yawn.,"Boring, slow, dull, uninspired. Hulk is an under-developed Frankenstein's Monster rip-off. Way too long for its way too short story.

This movie is about as intelligent as FOX-TV.

Computer generated images are NOT everything.

Wait, you were expecting mindless destruction? Sorry to disappoint you: There's not very much destruction either.

What a disappointment!,"I waited for so long for this movie. Ang Lee directing a character that can give you incredible action, this had the potential of a classic. But what happened? Its the ""John Woo syndrome"" all over again! Great work in Asia but when the director is brought over to Hollywood the work is TERRIBLE. Just judging by this movie Ang Lee is better suited for cinematography NOT directing. Crouching Tiger built up the expectations SO HIGH, so the drop to the Hulk's level is HUGE. Mr.Lee seems totally lost in this movie, there is no angle to the story and the story is bad too. I don't know if Mr.Lee wanted this project or was it given to him but it feels forced.

This movie is Resident Evil all over again and that's an insult.",4.0,30 June 2003
"'Daddy, when will he turn green?'","I am not going to put a lot of effort in writing a long review on this film. Just because it ain't worth it... .

When I watch a movie it has to get from A to Z in a flash. It has to capture your attention from the beginning to the end. Because of the awful cast, pointless dialogues and superficial story-line, this movie drags on and on and on. As a kid in the row behind me asked his father when Bruce would turn green, I was asking myself the same thing.

Stunning visuals though and a pretty good soundcard. But, Ang Lee, those things sell tickets, but they don't make a good film....

"I enjoyed it, but it isn't for everyone.","This movie isn't going to be the huge success some thought, but I really enjoyed it myself. The problem is the serious tone almost throughout the movie and the fact it takes awhile for the Hulk to make an appearance. Myself, I thought the story was great and interesting enough for me to be entertained, but I don't see this one being universally loved. Nothing wrong with those who don't like it, it just isn't a movie that is going to appeal to everyone. It did me, and I just hope it does well enough to warrant a sequel as it is sure to contain the Abomination, and trust me more people would love it. This one though is set up and serious set up at that. In fact older people may be more inclined to enjoy this than younger ones who need explosions every two minutes. The CGI looks rather good, not groundbreaking...for me though it was acceptable. The close ups are great and those who have been complaining since day one could at least say the close up shots of the Hulk were very well done. Sam Elliot is very good as General Ross, as is the entire cast. I gave this one a 9, only because I thought the end was a bit anticlimactic especially after the desert fights and the San Francisco scenes. All in all though I thought it was a good ride, but if a more serious comic book movie doesn't appeal to you I would skip it...if though you feel you can accept a more serious movie by all means this is the one you should come to.",8.0,21 June 2003
THE WORST BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! (SULK NOT HULK),"What a load of CRAP this movie is. I was wondering why attendances dropped by over 60% in its second week in the US and now i know. Word of mouth is very powerful and must have been the talk of the town after its release. Way overhyped to be something it's not, and although it's not cliched, it is really BAD. 20 minutes of action (which is not great)and 2 hours of non stop s*** dialogue that's tying to explain the story, but ends up boring us to death. I could easily have walked out half way through the movie but decided to stay, hoping i could salvage something out of the mess. Unfortunatly i did not and raced out of the cinema as fast as i could, desperatly wanting to tell everybody how awful this movie was. The highlights (or should i say moments that kept me awake) was the gorgeous Jennifer Connolly (need i say more) and the scene involving the tanks.

"Big Hulk, small angry men","If you take the Hulk out of this movie, all you're left with are men getting angry for one reason (or no reason) another, and the only ""solution"" to the problem they have is to use military force. The story is about small out of control angry men against the giant Hulk. If this is the state of our humanity, we're in BIG trouble. But if a movie exist that portrays such society, then some parts of it must be a reflection our psyche. Casting is bad which doesn't reflect the character of the people of the story and there're too many characters that are thrown in that doesn't help make the story better. The only two characters that works is Eric Banna and Jennifer Connery. Sam Elliot is a good actor and great as a cow boy, but just doesn't work as a believable army four star general. The original Marvel's Hulk plot had enough interesting characters to make the movie work without having to throw in Bruce Banner's father to bootstrap the story, or make major Talbot into a scum bag military industrialist. c'mon guys, work on the strength of the original characters and stop twisting the characters around so that you just succeeded in making the story poorer. There's a whole slew of Hulk nemesis that could have been brought in and still made the movie great instead of a having a character like freak dad Banner. The best scene in this movie asides from animated Hulk (which was bit spotty as well - weired because it had the face of an adolescent boy stretched into Hulk's face) was in the end where a guerrilla South American commando raids into Bruce Banner's medic camp and makes him angry. The commando character was totally believable and the rage Banner had for him was spot on. The screen writer, casting director, and Ang Lee himself should have worked more on story twists and plots like this.",4.0,3 October 2005
"The Hulk is not an ""artsy"" film","If you want a smart, complex comic book film with an excellent plot, a great cast, and great directing, go see Unbreakable. Now THERE was an underrated comic book movie.

Not For Movie Lovers,"If Anyone has any sense of quality movies...they will agree with me in saying that the Hulk was the greatest disgrace in movie history bar none......Mr. Lee turned a once in a lifetime chance to make the greatest movie of his career and destroyed it. I admit the Split scenes technique was expiremental but should have not been used in one of the most anticipated movies of the year. The Story was too long to make sense and most of the dialoge was unnecesary, the plot was too large, the CGI's were too dramatic and exagerrated, and the entire ordeal at the end with the father turning into an energy lifeform was way over the top and a despicable way of bringing in more useless fight scenes. Top Ten Worse Things About The Hulk (but not all of them)

1. Bruce Banner was not well protrayed...not by the acting mind you, but we comic book readers know that bruce banner was a loser who wore a white coat and glasses....the Bruce in this movie was neither of those. 2. The Hulk should have been about The Hulk's conflicts with the army and the army alone...The father should have been left out. 3. The Hulk was to small and too weak in the movie. 4. The entire ordeal between the general and his daughter was completely useless and added nothing to the movie. 5. The Split Scenes were so horrible and placed in the most crucial parts of the movie that it made the movie feel more like a comic book.. 6. Bruce was (in the movie) disturbed by his past experiences with his family and showed very little signs that he was outcasted socially. 7. Too slow in the beginning and too fast at the end....Mr. Lee does not know how to space it out. 8. The Hulk fighting the Dogs?? Come on....need i say more? 9. None of the original Music was used in the movie!! i was waiting to hear the Hulk theme but never did. 10. Overall the Movie was disgusting.

You'll excuse me if i seem slightly agetated but there are so many things i hate about this movie its too long to explain, if you want to agree or disagree with my comments or would like to discuss the movie or the hulk in greater depth email me",2.0,25 June 2003
"Great Effects, but dull story","First off the Hulk had incredible effects. The Hulk looked ultra realistic, especially in closeups, and was faithful to the comics (they even kept the trademark PURPLE PANTS!!!). While there are a couple of cartoonish effects, for the most part the effects were truly amazing. The standout scene was the Hulk's viscous fight with the mutated dogs, hands down the best part of the movie. The Hulk taking on the military in the desert was a classic scene straight out of the comics. The only complaints I have is, why does the Hulk grow when he gets mad? In some scenes he's standing almost 20 feet tall! That made the Hulk look like a giant green version of King Kong. He's only supposed to be about 7-8 feet tall! The madder he gets the stronger he gets NOT the bigger he gets! The fight with his father (The Absorbing Man) had potential but came off as disappointing (especially the water fight). Also it would have been cool if the Hulk spoke. ""Hulk Smash!"" ""Leave Hulk Alone!"" etc. My beef with the film though, is the complex story which dragged on in most parts and didn't make a whole lot of sense in other parts. Ang Lee tried to turn this movie into an dark art film which almost ruined it and turned off a lot of the mainstream audience. He would have been better off treating this as an action style movie like the other comic films out there, as opposed to a melodrama . Still overall, it was a pretty good flick (alot better then most people will give it credit for), and hopefully we'll see a sequel.",10.0,15 November 2003

Wholly Unsatisfying,"I really wanted to like this movie; I really did. However, at the end of the movie, I felt a little disappointed, even cheated.

There is no real ""plot"" in this movie in the sense that there's a concrete conflict that must be solved; rather, it focuses on the character of Bruce and how this beast inside him is aroused. This would be fine had they been able to capture the audience and get them to relate to the main character. Sadly, the opening hour or so of the movie does a poor job of accomplishing this; with the considerable chunk of time devoted to this part of the movie, it should have been able to do so. Most of the back story is told through short, abrupt flashbacks, which fail to get the viewer to identify with Bruce and understand his repressed rage. As a whole, the plot seems disconnected; it seems like those making this movie weren't quite sure with what direction they wanted to go. The ending is rather anti-climactic; while during the final half hour of the movie it seems like the action's building to this great crescendo, it kind of ends with a slight thud rather than with a flash and a bang.

You'll hear a lot about the CG of the Hulk in these next few weeks; some people will praise it and some will say it would have been better done using claymation or stop-motion cinematography. Being that we would be seeing a lot of the hulk, it seemed necessary to me to have a CG Hulk that seems as lifelike as possible. I, for one, was rather unimpressed with the CG of the Hulk. The first scene where you see Banner transform is actually very well done, but for the rest of the movie, the Hulk seems rather out of place. It seems to me that the CG was rushed to meet a deadline; whether or not this is true, the CG still seems to be missing a layer of polish that would have been accomplished with a little more time. The scenes where it is dark do not look very bad, probably because you can't see him too well. The worst scenes by far are the ones where you are viewing the Hulk from afar as he runs through the desert; it is here that the second-rate CG truly rears its ugly head. While the CG of the Hulk was not the worst I've seen recently (Scooby-Doo takes that unenviable award in my book), I've seen much, much better (Gollum/Smeagol in The Two Towers, for example).

There are many times were Ang Lee uses multi-paneling in the movie. While this technique works well when used correctly, it seems that this camera trick was used many times solely for the sake of using it; many of the scenes where it's used could have been done without it. One scene in particular shows six or so different angles of a single helicopter landing. I ask, ""What's the point?"" While some may say that it adds to the ""comic-book feel"" of the movie, I found it irritating and even nauseating at times.

The action scenes are actually quite good in the movie, and it is fun to watch the Hulk take on tanks and helicopters while running through the desert. While being the strong point of the movie, these scenes seem to come too late to save this movie from falling into mediocrity.

Again, I really wanted to like this movie; I'd been looking forward to it for a long time. However, at the end, I felt wholly unsatisfied; this movie could have been so much more.",4.0,20 June 2003

"Unfortunately, The Hulk tries to be too much","It appears as though Ang Lee created a taut, psychologically intricate film that the studio forced him to re-work at the last minute. One article I read stated that Lee was told to increase the action element of the film; as a viewer, this seems to be what happened.

The tension of Bruce's torn subconscious, his relationship with Betty, the involvement of General Ross, and the sociopathic ambition of David Banner are all lost in an overly-convoluted quasi-summer blockbuster.

I have nothing against plot strings that seem too numerous to count, but the problem with The Hulk is that the viewer can never see how one string crosses another or where one string ends and another begins; this leads to a jumbled mess that does nothing more than confuse and irritate the audience.

Luckily, Lee's solid movie-making abilities allows the plot to progress (more or less), but it is undeniable that his attempt at making a brooding, introspective psychological thriller was derailed by somebody (money-hungry studio execs?) and never fully fit the mold of ""awesome summer blockbuster action movie"" or ""deep, engaging, thought-provoking thriller."" It ended up being a sloppy mess of each, never fully satisfying either audience.

I feel bad picking apart a work that took so long to produce, but as a Marvel fan I would have been happy with a ""slam-bang, turn-off-your-brain-for-two-hours"" action movie or a ""hmmm...there's so much depth to the Bruce/Hulk dichotomy"" film.

"Nick Nolte is obvnoxious, but otherwise...","After reading some fairly negative reviews of this film, I have to say

I was pleasantly surprised when I finally did see it for myself. I

thought that the performances were entertaining and the green

giant looked fantastic. Everyone in the theatre seemed to be

laughing out loud when he came onto the screen - NOT LAUGHING AT HIM! We were all just so enthralled we could not

stifle our joy at seeing him throw, smash, jump, etc. for the very

first time. Less enthralling was the character of the bad-guy dad, played

by Nick Nolte. It was depressing to see Nolte acting so crazy after

that mugshot of his - it didn't really seem like he was even acting in

some parts, and there is one scene (at least) with him that is just

truly awful - embarassingly so. That said, the movie itself is well worth the price of a ticket. It

gets a little bogged down with its' protracted scenes of

psychobabble - Betty and her father, Betty and Bruce, Bruce and

his father, etc. etc. But when the not-so jolly green giant is on the

screen, watch out for some serious fun. I was thrilled completely

by him. Another thing about this film I liked at times was the split

screen stuff they did. It was overused a little bit, but they seemed to

find new ways of using it and the editing was unbelievable, as

were the special effects, and most of the acting. Overall an enjoyable experience, and one I would definitely

recommend. Watch out too for a great ending scene; it will leave

you with visions of superheroes and waiting for more...",5.0,25 June 2003
Hulk Rules...........,"This film is not only in my opinion the best MARVEL film but the best character study in a comic book film ever, and it's disappointing to me that the stuff taken from the comics is considered inaccurate. 1st the Hulk dogs were in the comic books they first appeared in 1984 called a gamma dog. 2nd the computer generated imagery they say he looks like Shrek 1st the film came out in 2003 2nd they were done by industrial light and magic and 3rd he does not look like Shrek to me at all the cg for 03 is amazing and to me they still hold up. 3rd the plot is to complicated in my opinion this film is easier to follow than dark knight and i was 3 when i first saw this in theaters and it didn't bore me at all.4th they change hulks origin what i have to say is your a freaking idiot like Stan Lee's original comic Bruce banner saves someone from the gamma rays and he gets stuck in it but instead of a blast its a machine like the 1970's TV show. Finally in my honest opinion this film is a great well acted character study with great visuals characters and villains with an amazing plot ahead of its time.",10.0,14 February 2015
The Political Hulk,"This is a fine and moody adaptation of the Marvel's Incredible Hulk comics, combining elements from the early Hulk stories with more recent interpretations and retcon versions of the character. In terms of visuals, acting, emotion and story, this is far more interesting than most of the comic book movies made, yet this film is exiled to relative obscurity due to underperformance at the box office.

Personally, I think this film was about 2 years ahead of its time...2 years after Hulk's release the positively morose and glacially slow 'Batman Begins' was a huge hit(though 'Batman Begins' did take advantage of Time/Warner's planet-size media clout for marketing purposes).

Also, 'Hulk' portrays the American military as being reactionary, treacherous, aggressive, duplicitous, and even sadistic.. all of which qualities are faithful to the original Marvel comics of the 1960's, yet are facts the gingoistic 'Mission Accomplished' media and public did not want to face in 2003.

Had this movie been released after the photos of American soldiers torturing prisoners, or after the reports of US troops using phosphorus against civilians in Fallujah had emerged, the public might have accepted this film more readily. Or not, seeing as American media, 7 years later, refuse to discuss these or any other substantive issues of national morality.

Regardless, this is a well-produced and well-directed film, with fine performances from Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly. Ms. Connelly in particular should be singled out for being vastly superior to Liv Tyler who replaced her for the inferior 2008 'The Incredible Hulk' film.",9.0,7 January 2011

Hulk - Oscar Winner,"Many people have commented on this film and they belong to either of these two groups - those who think it's boring (maybe they saw the green lights and thought it was The Matrix) and didn't understand what was going on (yup, like philosophy) and then when the action happens it's cool except that it's unbelievable that Hulk didn't drop his pants when he shrank (yeah, right, now that would be both realistic and in good taste ...). The others understand what Ang Lee is trying to do (without having to really analyse the film, in case some people think that is the case), enjoys the seriousness and graveness the film presents, and think that when the action happens it's downright cool and entertaining too.

I belong to the latter group (anyone who's able to work that out does deserve some prize - currently the split is 50/50). The name Ang Lee would have sounded alarm bells in the first place - for me it sounded like 'WHAT?!' Then was the anticipation - the studios have made an interesting choice ... it would really be interesting to see how the film turned out to be like. It's so long since I've been to a film where its contents are unexpected - unlike every other film nowadays, through either the trailer, synopsis or review you know some of the stuff that will appear on screen, so that what was original when the script was penned suddenly became a cliche simply because you experienced the film from all three sources.

And when I finally saw it - wow. I was half-dizzy from the experience - my brain was numb, couldn't think, not even of what the whole thing fully meant. All I knew was it was a good movie - it told a story, acknowledged its roots without distracting (those who were distracted by the you-know-what probably have short concentration spans

anyway), and also surprised me. I didn't know the Hulk could jump, run and hop like that, but it was interesting that he did. It was real - just let yourself believe that it is real in the world of the film and you will enjoy it, as simple as that. Instead certain people chose to pay with their hard-earned cash and go in with a set expectation of what's going to happen (under 2 hours of smashing stuff) and refusing to let that expectation go even when it was clearly wrong, even if letting it go means enjoying the film. As for his pants? It was a special material that could stretch by a large amount - they're the military, they have enough money to spend on this stuff. Now enough about the pants, coz I'm more interested in seeing what happens next with the relationship between Bruce and Betty and his father ...

Point is, this film is aiming for the Oscars. Best Editing (hey, JFK won remember?), Best Sound (notice the sound used when Hulk is running), Best Cinematography (the shot of the helicopter flying above the waters was stunning), Best Special Effects, Best Direction - and Best Picture. The signs are all there. It won't win Best Picture, but see that it gets nominated. The cast won't get a nomination, but that's not because they did it badly. Some people complained that Eric Bana wasn't explosive enough - erm, anyone with a sober brain would realise that he is playing a quiet introvert here. There is a point to choosing someone who's capable of exploding to play someone whose explosions

happen within and not without - Bruce Banner might almost never explode but you feel it subconsciously. (But of course I'm being idealistic. The Academy Awards are not about awarding awards and nomination to the right winners, but to wade between the heavy pressure of anticipation of the press and the audience in general. For example, how many people understood what was the theme of The Hours?)

Some people complain about the film being a franchise and all and that the ending suggests a sequel. Yes it does, but I'm comforted by the fact that if (unfortunately it's a BIG IF, thanks to all the film-bashers out there) there is a sequel, no one else can take over and still maintain the same tone and style of this film and hence will be an abomination (take the case of Brian De Palma vs John Woo). It can only be directed by Ang Lee.

P.S. - For the record, I thought it was great that the film was 2 hours and 20 minutes. If there is a sequel it had better be as long as that.",10.0,26 November 2003
Simple-minded Americans beware! Good movie warning!,"There has been a typical American reaction to this film. ""Too much talking!"" ""Not enough action!"" ""Boring!"" ""Why does it take so long for the Hulk to appear?"" You want to be wowed by mindless special effects, you pay your money to not have to think for two hours. It should come as no shock that the next weekend after Hulk opened Charlie's Angels was the number one movie. Now that's the kind of movie Americans want to watch. A nonsensical plot, terrible dialogue, even worse acting, but plenty of eye candy to keep a big smile on your face throughout. You all sit through the Matrix Reloaded oohing and awing over the fantastic action scenes, when the rest of the movie sucked (don't be fooled by the meaningless psychobabble of the Architect, the Oracle or Morpheus). You should have known that Ang Lee doesn't create that type of movie. If you bothered to watch any other of his movies (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon excepted), you'd probably be just as bored. Lee is a director who puts some thought into his movies, and there's a whole lot more for you, as the viewer, to think about than just wondering when the next action sequence is going to come along. Ang Lee has done a commendable job in making this movie, bringing his very different perspective to the superhero genre. And while the film is certainly not perfect, it is still an engagingly cerebral take on the Bruce Banner story, and it's deserving of more credit than it gets. So the next time you pay your 8 bucks to see an Ang Lee picture (and I'm sure most of you never will again), don't assume that it's time to shut down your brain for a while and be entertained by nothing more than a series of high-tech effects and images. There are plenty of other directors out there willing to make empty, action-packed films about comic book heros. Fortunately, Ang Lee is not one of them.",8.0,9 July 2003
Me like Hulk!,"Movie lovers will appreciate this movie far better than the lets say the average teenager. ""Hulk"" is very different than any other superhero movie from the last couple of years. The movie is not aimed for the average teenagers audience that liked movies like ""X-Men"" and ""X2"", ""Hulk"" has more drama than action and more substance than entertainment.

I really like what Ang Lee made of this movie. He gave the characters some real depth and the story emotion. The use of the special effects are subtle and not made to impress the audience with but are really used as a tool to tell the story, unlike many other movies from the same superhero genre. All in all this movie might very well the best comic book adaptation so far, with a real good comic book atmosphere.

The thing I liked most about this movie was the editing. I was really disappointed that this movie didn't even got an Oscar nomination for best editing. It might very well be the best I've seen in a movie and lots of wonderful editing tricks are used to give this movie an extra kind of comic book feeling.

I didn't expected too much from Danny Elfman's musical score, particularly not after ""Spider-Man"" that in my opinion had a weak unfitting score. But I should had known better, after all this is that man that also brought us the famous ""Batman"" music. The score for ""Hulk"" really was excellent and is one I enjoy listening to.

Nick Nolte really was a pleasure to watch in this movie but oh boy did he looked sick (that was because he was constantly drunk on the set), he completely played Eric Bana of the screen at the end.

This movie is recommendable to everyone as long as you are not expecting a superhero movie with lot's of action and special effects and a stereotype villain. I really hope ""Hulk 2"" will be made some day, with Ang Lee at the helm again.

He did such a good job coming off as geeky and yet handsome. His chemistry was great with Connelly. And as always Nick Nolte makes a great bad guy thats memorable.

The movie is filmed more like an art piece. It was filmed in a comic book style. I really do not like the screen splits. They're hard to follow and are very irritating to watch. The bases of the movie is Bruce having trauma that is fuelling his anger and making the hulk. I think this plot was a little weak and would have been okay as a side story amongst the whole, but it was the main theme of the movie and really took away from the cool action figure that the hulk is.

I really enjoyed the fact that the hulk keeps growing bigger and bigger the madder he gets. I thought that concept was cool. The CGI was horrible. And it made no sense why his pants would continue to fit him.

I wish they could have combined this awesome cast and heart felt story with the newer Hulk movie that has great CGI and better action. The two movies combined would have been great.",8.0,9 August 2023

Another Marvel hit,"""Hulk"" is the 2003 adaptation of the popular Marvel Comics character about a geneticist named Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) who transforms into a giant, green beast when stressed. This ability (or curse?) naturally makes him a threat to the army, who chase him across the desert and into San Francisco in the films biggest action sequence. Yet, Banner's traumas have not gone unnoticed, especially in the eyes of Betty Ross (Academy Award-Winner, Jennifer Connelly), Bruce's close friend.

This is certainly a great film with some impressive special effects. There was some debate over whether or not the CGI Hulk would be convincing on screen and I think it is. Eric Bana, who is relatively unknown and whose only previous film credit is Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"", puts on the films best performance, despite his somewhat limited presence on screen.

I've never paid that much attention to the Incredible Hulk, most likely because he was never one of my favorite Marvel characters. I have always been a Spider-Man and X-Men fan. Even so, I did thoroughly enjoy myself watching this.

Though ""Hulk"" is rated ""PG-13"", I really would not recommend letting little kids see it, because it is quite disturbing in some parts, especially when the Hulk battles a quartet of mutant dogs.

Hulk 2003,"I should mention that this film was influenced by the comics ""The Incredible Hulk"" (may, 1962) The film took the main idea of this character from the original comics and focused on the relations between Bruce Banner and his father. It emphasized the complexed relations between Bruce and his father. This movie is relatively slow, and hence it is difficult for people to be attached to it. This is not a sufficient reason for the negative criticism of many regarding this film. Few critics did not like Nik Nolte's performance, but we should remember that this character did not have its significant role in comics at all So that this very character was full modified only in our film and spectators do identify with it easily the interrelationships between Betty and her father were unique and interesting. Moreover, it enabled a comparative examination between the two sets of relationships - Banner and his father and Betty and her father We see that the two fathers acted against their families in spite of the fact that they present their activities as right and proper Betty's father is trying to stop Banner's father from his experiments in his wife and his son it designates him as the ""good family person"" but in the continuation, we realize his terrible activity when he tries to use the scientist's son as a kind of a weapon, and all that in spite of the fact that he knew that his daughter Betty was his colleague and his ex-girlfriend. Bruce's father made medical experiments in his daughter and her boyfriend...and his wife based upon the belief that it helped them. In fact, both fathers acted from their own interests and not based upon family care.",10.0,4 August 2017
A great movie,"This is, to date, my favorite superhero movie. I can but wonder why so many people think it is so bad.

First, since it's a superhero movie, there's the action scenes. There's not too many of them, and what there is, is quite good.

I recall there being some criticism about the Hulk's 3D model and how it is not detailed enough. While I kinda agree that it could be better, I do not think it is too distracting.

Now, on to the story and characters. And here is the strongest part of the movie. The interaction of Hulk and Betty Ross is something that touches me on a personal level. And in general the characters are mainly well developed and have interesting enough interaction. The story progresses at a nice pace, not being too fast or too slow. It's definitely a ""smarter"" and even more emotional than, say, the Spider-Man movies.

I can't think of too much else to say, since to me so much of what is good about this movie I can't really find the words for, and in the end it's the overall feeling that counts. I'll end this by saying that while the new ""The Incredible Hulk"" was a decent movie on its own right, in my books it doesn't hold a candle to this movie.",9.0,26 May 2009
Far better than the mainstream will admit!,"The Hulk is an excellent attempt at trying to bring to life one of the most famous comic book characters of all time. What many people seem to have missed, is that this is not attempting to be a super hero film in traditional sense. There is not the generic and simplistic ""good guy vs Bad Guy story"" which are ever present in both the Spider-man and Superman franchises. This film is far more complex than that, in the sense that Banner himself has conflicting views on his own abilities, and that he does present a real danger to himself and others. The threat of this danger provide a tension throughout this film. The acting is very good by all the major cast. Eric Bana really gets across the inner underlying aggression of the character, and there is good chemistry between him and Connelly. Ang Lee should be commended for trying to add a greater complexity to this genre. The use of split screen panels provides the film with a fast moving pace, and also allows alot of information to be displayed and understood at anyone time. I also feel this film contains the most complex and ambitious CGI I have ever seen, though it is not the most effective. I feel the movement and the muscle tone of the hulk are spot on. Though the face could have been improved so that there is more life in the characters eyes. However I can ignore this due to the breathtaking action scenes between the Hulk and the army which are far better than I expected. This is NOT a bad film as many people seem to insist. In fact in my view Lee has managed to create a film which is a very worthwhile addition to the genre. There was always going to be a backlash against comic book films due to there recent resurgence, and the Hulk has received the majority of this due to a less than impressive super bowl trailer. The simple fact is that most people had made there opinion on this film before they had even seen it. The Hulk is one of the most interesting and entertaining blockbusters of the summer and deserve far more recognition than it has received!",8.0,27 July 2003
A good movie,"Honestly, I thought that this was going to be a failed experiment from Ang Lee, but I was positively surprised when I went to see the movie on the opening day here. Eric Bana plays his part extremely well and the Hulk is visually amazing!!! Ang Lee introduced directing details that give this movie an extra ""comic book"" touch that other movies of the same kind have failed to provide so far. Also, there's a close viewing and exploration of the sentimental and psychological side of the original story. In short, this isn't just another action-packed movie, where we only see kicks and punches throughout the entire movie. I hope there's a sequel and that it'll be better than this one, because there's always room for improvement. Good work, Ang. Congratulations.",8.0,16 July 2003
Hulk Brought to life,"Hulk is one of the best Marvel heroes ever. I remember seeing this film back when it first came out and being astonished to to finally see him on the big screen. The special effects are outstanding and the Hulk looks so real you could just reach out and touch him. Eric Bana did an excellent job, as well as Sam Elliot and the rest of the cast. And the action sequences were all heart thumping to say the least. And the icing on top of it all, Danny Elfman delivers a grand score that makes the movie ever more involving. Many bash it, but I view it as one of the best superhero films. At times the pacing is a tad off, I'll admit, the only real consensus being that audiences did not want deep characters and a plot that made you think. They just wanted more action and a trimmed down storyline. Sounds about right.",10.0,21 January 2011
Very good.,"I thought this movie would suck but i was sorely mistaken. Nick Nolte was great the over-acting was perfect by nolte, All together the acting was good,Bana did a great job, Top Notch special effects ,The whole split screen effects were like reading a comic book. Alot of destruction,Terror and Mayhem, Better than spiderman and xmen. Batman & Superman movies are on a whole different level but the hulk is the best comic book hero movie since 1989 Batman. Very Good.",9.0,22 June 2003
good film,"Mostly comics but with excellent special effects. The actors have a good presence and reflect very well the balloon. Among not much will come out and follow in my opinion should be interesting. Many times these films seem absurd but the absurdity there is a part of world cinema, entertainment comics. The rage of the Hulk against men or against those who want to prevent is that no sophisticated weapon can defeat the power of nature, the strength of a powerful being. Beautiful scenes showing the attacks against the military, against tanks and f-22, remembers very Godzilla. Before you criticize stay informed on the first comics.

Good comics turned into films.",10.0,28 January 2008

A Beautifully Dark Comic Book Character Study,"Ang Lee's Hulk is a wonder to behold, even when the action on screen starts to slow. Many viewers will be disappointed by the big green guy's lack of screen time, but Lee's innovative directing style will carry film fans through the rough patches. When the Hulk is on screen, the fun manifests itself in the form of massive destruction, three-mile jumps, and a surprising conclusion involving Bruce Banner's father (brought to life by the wonderfully weird Nick Nolte). When Bruce banner is on screen, the movie takes on another tone entirely as it explores heavy themes such as domestic abuse and repressed memories. With his beautifully dark cinematography and comic-style editing techniques, Ang Lee pulls these seemingly disparate elements together into an equally thrilling and thought-provoking film. Thumbs up also to Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly for their emotionally layered performances. 9/10",9.0,26 June 2003
"Beautiful, intelligent, dark, exciting: Ang Lee's HULK","I honestly don't know what people are complaining about. The CGI was absolutely top-notch! Absolutely as good as (if not better than) Gollum from LOTR.

Hulk was real. Alive. A character of flesh and bones that you could touch. At least seemingly so.

Hulk interacted with his surroundings more than any other CGI character I've ever seen - yes, including Gollum.

And the CGI was not even the best part of this film. It was the story.

Ang Lee is a brilliant and bold director. This was absolutely his film. There were many times through the movie when I thought to myself: ""This is the Director's cut!"" I was amazed that studio executives didn't cut it up to make it into a shorter, tighter ""summer action flick"". Of course, that is exactly what many people were expecting, which perhaps explains it's mixed reviews.

The first hour of HULK was building and developing the characters. All of them. From Betty Ross (the beautiful and talented Jennifer Connelly - who absolutely steals the show here with her acting) to David Banner (Bruce Banners' sanity-absent father, a solid and convincing performance by Nick Nolte) to Ross' Military Dad (played brilliantly by Sam Elliott) to Bruce himself (Eric Bana was perfect. PERFECT!).

I could really go on and on about how much I liked this movie, but I never like to read long reviews, so I'll try to keep this one short too.

Trust me: If you liked the style of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, and you can appreciate a serious and somewhat dark Sci-Fi movie, this one's for you!

Just keep in mind that this is NOT a kid's movie (like Star Wars or Spiderman) and that the action is only secondary to the story.

My rating: 9 out of 10",8.0,11 July 2003
"Very underrated, an intelligent and well acted blockbuster!!","The big green machine is back in this top draw comic book movie. With Ang Lee at the helm this is more than just a smash, bang and wallop of a film you would expect from a Hulk film, but it is played out like a Greek tragedy with the character of the Hulk being very humanized and being a metaphor for something inside us all, its very poignant and thought provoking but many fans and even critics have responded negatively to the attempt at drama, saying they want more smashing. I find this sad because there's a good script there, this film is sorely underrated.

The first forty minutes build up to the first appearance of the Hulk and this tended to alienate half the audience, those who just wanted smashing were bored but the others were interested in the development of Banners character and his relationship with Betty, in many ways the film tries to add heart to the tale much like the TV series did. When the Hulk does appear the action junkies woke to see some of the most impressive effects ever seen. The Hulk looks fantastic, all those doubts wiped from peoples minds and the performance of the Hulk is good, much of Eric Bana translates through to the green meanie, and indeed much of the Hulks physical performance is Ang Lee himself. The interaction between Hulk and his environment is amazing too.

There of course could have been trimming in the opening hour or so yes but the performances from Eric Bana as Bruce and Jennifer Connelly as Betty were superb. Connelly is particularly good as Betty, it's the natural beauty and the angelic eyes (which are themselves Green, her casting seems almost too perfect)that when she tames the Hulk just from his sighting of her your believe it, the intelligence of the script and the forewarning from the opening forty minutes is particularly resonant, the way in which Betty is intrigued and almost obsessed to find out what is going on in Banners head, why he is so emotionally retarded, it is ironic that in her pursuit to delve inside Banners soul that his inner self (the suppressed rage) is released. The dimensions added to the characters are interesting. As such with the increase in character depth there is a problem with pacing in the movie, particularly for a summer movie. It almost seems like the combination of drama and blockbuster haven't quite gelled together and subsequently Hulk has suffered at the box office, for me I am one of the narrow majority who thinks that it works. There is not enough drama for it to be a drama and not enough bang and smash or one liners for it to be box office fodder.

The cast are top draw. Eric Bana continues his prominent rise to A-list Hollywood. The gorgeous Jennifer Connelly is very good but some may argue wasted when compared to her Oscar winning role in Beautiful Mind, but she doesn't have as much screen time here and of course the story takes a step back when the smashing begins. Sam Elliot as Betty's father is also good. Nick Nolte is really chewing up the scenery and plays it dangerously close to the borderline of ham but at time he manages to get a chill down the spine. Of course there is real class behind the camera and combined with the quality of the cast, the dramatic scenes are very good. The cinematography is also superb, this movie is masterfully shot, the desert scenes really look great. ILM have surpassed themselves again and the master of fantastical scores Danny Elfman hits the mark once again. The editing of the movie is very unique and flashy and adds to the comic book element, the use of split screen is on the most part well used and there are some great transition shots, occasionally the art house editing is overused though particularly when the Hulk is on the rampage.

Overall this is a worthy take on the Hulk saga and the sequel is an exciting prospect. If you want action then you get it, if you want drama, you get that just not at the same time. I liked the film, very underrated. ****",8.0,18 July 2003
Incredibly Underrated,"i just do not see why the Hulk wasn't fantastically well received on release. it has brilliant visual effects and sound throughout, some amazing actors on board for a comic book adaptation. it actually has a story. and the hulk is just brilliant, a perfect green ball of rage!

this film will absolutely stand the test of time, whereas other movies with inferior and overly ambitious effects such as spider-man for example will become the super-mans of the future. just four years down the line this movie looks fresh in comparison to most of the marvel related tripe that has been released in recent years including an atrocious punisher movie, and most recently an o.a.p version of ghost rider plus a pretty crappy 1st instalment of spider-man

i think overall maybe they didn't edit this movie down as ruthlessly as they should have done although the hulk is lean compared to Peter Jacksons king kong for example. and perhaps they did not market the finished product to the correct target audience.

this is absolutely not a commercial kids movie, and would only really be appreciated by extremely discernible youths and young adults. for proper adults though this movie has it all.

if you've been put off by the poor reviews please bear in mind that 75% of these will be from disgruntled fan boys who have not even been pacified by the presence of the wonderful Jennifer Connelly, so do not be put off.

overall that says it all really, we have a complex female lead here instead of pure eye candy. a bit like this movie in general. dark, intelligent, complicated but with true underlying quality rather than your normal crash and bash Hollywood comic book trash

i urge you to watch the Hulk, and hat off to Ang Lee for the best comic book to movie adaptation i have seen",9.0,13 April 2007
"I enjoyed this, even though so many didn't","Despite the constant bombardment of rants that this movie has suffered in it's short four-year existence, this movie has proved to myself to be quite entertaining. Contrary to the opinions of many self-proclaimed critics, Eric Bana gave an excellent performance as Bruce Banner, his co- star Jennifer Connolly was equally wonderful as Betty Ross. The supporting cast that follows them was very well assigned, such names as Sam Elliot, Josh Lucas and Nick Nolte. Ang Lee's direction gave this comic book film a unique touch that I haven't seen in other such films. His use of multiple shots appearing at once (reminiscent of the TV series 24) proved to be an interesting instrument to grab your attention, and beyond that the general fit and finish of the film came across as top notch. David Elfman's score was enchanting and thrilling to add to the characteristics of the film itself. Overall, I don't have much to say other than the direction this film had and the actors who were in it were all very excellent. This film wasn't made to be a masterpiece of the same caliber of works done by Steven Spielburg, nor should it be expected as such. It's a comic book movie and should be enjoyed for it's mere entertainment value at the very least.",8.0,7 May 2007
Incredible!!!!!,"That's about the only word that I can come up with to describe this absolute masterpiece of cinema. Hollywood can learn something from Ang Lee, but I doubt they ever will. Yet unlike many reviews I've read who were expecting a big guns action movie, this is far from it. It is a character piece, with some action thrown in on the side.

Eric Bana was absolutely wonderful as Bruce Banner. He played the role perfectly. Jennifer Connely was a wonderful choice for Betty Ross. You could feel her sympathy and love towards Bruce and the Hulk in her eyes and voice. Nick Nolte is always a joy to see anymore. Sam Elliot portrayed Thunderbolt Ross briliantly.

Ang Lee's use of split-screen was spectacular. It brought the comic-book essence that has been missing from many comic movies. It was like being a kid again, reading The Hulk outside the comic shop.

And yet this is not a typical action movie. This is a character movie. It has suspense, drama, and a bit of action for those who've been brainwashed by Hollywood. Yet the action is in the end, but the story builds up to it.

I loved this movie. I'm incredibly happy that they finally got around to making a Hulk movie. It has been a few years coming, and boy was the wait worth every penny.",9.0,21 June 2003
The Hulk (2003) vs. The Incredible Hulk (2008),"This movie is like a gourmet meal compared to the processed McDonald's- like 2008 reboot' ""The Incredible Hulk"".

Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" is a comic book movie for the thinking person. The Hulk takes some time to appear (about 40 minutes), but when he does we see the conflict at our protagonist's core. He does his best to avoid losing control, but as he admits, when he does give in to his rage, he likes it.

Now compare this to Edward Norton's turn, where there is no display of conflict in his personality, and he turns into the Hulk whenever he becomes excited and his pulse rate hits 200 beats per minute (not 183, not 197, but exactly 200). To this reviewer, this felt akin to the introduction of midi-chlorians in The Phantom Menace, which tell how strong the ""force"" is with one, as if mystical abilities can be gauged through a blood test. In the 2008 movie, all Ed Norton's Bruce Banner has to do is to keep his pulse rate under 200, as monitored by a device strapped onto his wrist. And for the record, it is extremely difficult to get one's pulse rate up to 200 even through a very exhilarating run, especially for a physically fit person.

Emotions drive Eric Bana's Hulk. He has repressed memories of his mother's death and his father's role in his early life. On the surface he is calm, but there underneath there is significant anger, enough rage to fuel the Hulk when it is unleashed. But the Hulk never kills intentionally, even his attackers. Mostly, he just wants to get away or close to Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). He incapacitates his shooters and in one critical scene, saves a fighter jet pursuing him from a collision.

In the 2003 movie, the visual effects are there, but as necessary. The action scenes (and there are plenty of them) are necessary to the plot, unlike the 2008 movie where action is inserted for the sake of action.

The only thing going against the 2003 movie is that it is perhaps not as true to the comic books as the 2008 version. However, even as I am a fan of the comics, I would prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a fanboy's dream but has heart over the comics-loyal but manufactured and soulless 2008 version any day.

Perhaps Ang Lee should have read more comics. Iron Man, also released in 2008, is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic-book roots and has heart.

I am stunned that IMDb users have given such a low score to this movie. Normally, IMDb users provide very reliable ratings. I hope that in time this movie comes to be recognized as the classic that it is.",8.0,5 December 2009

The casting was quite good, Eric Bana was fantastic. But they could have played down the David Banner thing, but I enjoyed the showdown at the end between Hulk, Jr. and Hulk, Sr. Jennifer Connelly was good as Betty, Sam Elliot and Josh Lucas are okay, but I didn't really like Nick Nolte. The movie is 2 hours and 18 minutes, but it only dragged for about 10 minutes in the first half hour. I give ""Hulk"" 9 out of 10 stars.",9.0,28 June 2003
It's good to be green...,"Move over Kermit the Frog, Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno and make way for the all new GREEN MACHINE, Eric Bana and his CGI counterpart as the HULK! I'll always have fond memories of the 1978 television show, ""The Incredible Hulk,"" so it was with a bit of trepidation I wondered how this movie could improve upon the transformation of the diminutive, Bixby into his alter-ego, the Hulk, played by Lou Ferrigno. Fear not, as technology is wonderful and with the aid of computer graphics, Bana's strapping 6'4 frame bulks to ungodly proportions! Nick Nolte, cast as ""David Banner,"" would not have been my first choice to play Bruce Banner's father, but if the director was going for the ""mad"" scientist look, then Nolte was right on target...he was definitely scary looking! Jennifer Connelly, as Bana's love interest was just a perfect mixture of brains and beauty-with a heart after all! Probably the two most memorable parts of this movie were the scenes focusing on the HULK's eyes...it brings tears to my own eyes just recalling this, and the scenes of the down-sizing...INCREDIBLE!

Overall, this movie was fun and leaves the audience just primed for a sequel.",8.0,3 July 2003
...a pleasant surprise,"I went to see Hulk having very low expectations, mostly after reading dozens of average reviews.

But I must say I was pleasantly surprised.

I never read the comic book or saw any of the TV-show, so on that account I didnt have anything to be disappointed about.

The movie is a bit long, but the editing made scenes interesting, which might have been a tad boring without it. The way the editing, the picture-in-picture and the switching camera angles (breaking the basic rules of film over and over) made the movie more comic-book'ish is very successful. It's a good way of showing this movie doesn't necessaily stay within the boundaries you'd expect.

The acting was overall very good, with Eric Bana having the hardest job.. It doesn't matter how good you are, you cannot avoid looking pathetic when you 10 seconds earlier stood 15ft tall and wrecked half of town, and now you're whining and almost can't stay on your feet, only covered by your super stretch boxers.

The action scenes were very energetic - none of them being too much (like in Matrix 2). Hulk was very brutal indeed, in a way i could've only hoped!

I don't know if the story is close to that of the comics, but it was very entertaining in my opinion, with a nice quiet build-up giving space for decent character introductions. Action and drama goes well hand in hand, and in this movie, one cannot live without the other.

While it's obvious Hulk is computer generated, the CGI crew did a great job blending him into the surroundings, and watching him jumping around, throwing with tanks and thelike is very enjoyable.

I was afraid I was gonna be disappointed, but against my expectations I felt greatly entertained by Hulk, and I can only hope for a sequel.",9.0,11 July 2003
The final result is one of great filmmaking that is quite possibly one of the best comic adaptations in the history of motion pictures.,"Movie adaptations of classic comic books are more common place than ever these days. Be it the fun `Spider-Man' that broke box-office records in its first opening weekend, or the atrocious `Daredevil' that starred the once good actor, Ben Affleck, comic adapted films are becoming somewhat of a cliché. The real trick is to make the film seem original by portraying the main character as troubled, but also noble and powerful. This was exactly what director Ang Lee did for the new film `The Hulk.' By using a split screen technique, outstanding actors and awesome visual effects, Lee makes `The Hulk' transcend the comic by making the audience feel as if they are viewing the comic on the screen. The final result is one of great filmmaking that is quite possibly one of the best comic adaptations in the history of motion pictures. `The Hulk' is the story of a scientist named Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) who is exposed to radiation during an experiment that triggers a destructive element in his body. Bruce inherited this element from his father (Nick Nolte) who was a scientist with the military in the 1960s that was working on a gene to create a super-human. When his father's project is abandoned by the military, he injects the genetic substance into his body and passes it off to his newborn son. Now in the present, Bruce is becoming ever more troubled by the strange occurrences in his body. When faced with extreme emotional distress, Bruce transforms into a green giant seeking revenge on anyone who harms him or his beloved former girlfriend, Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). It's now up to the military to try to stop the hulk before he harms himself, or anyone else. Director Lee is well known for his more art-house films such as `Sense Sensibility,' `The Ice Storm' and the classic `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.' It was quite a surprise to see his name pushing the release of `The Hulk'-the trailers made it seem as if it were going to be a no-brainer, unlike Lee's usual brand of filmmaking. However, there were telltale signs that `The Hulk' could be quite good. For one, Lee was directing. Two, a superb cast of actors like Eric Bana (`Black Hawk Down'), Jennifer Connelly (`A Beautiful Mind'), Nick Nolte (`Affliction') and Sam Elliot (`The Contender'). Lee's direction is masterful on this film; he doesn't blow the show over the top with non-stop action sequences or absurd one-liners.

The best part about `The Hulk' was the way that Lee presented the story on the screen. He used a technique of splitting the screen into various segments that make the viewer feel as if they are looking at a comic on screen. For example, a small box on the screen may have the shot of a troubled Elliot who plays a general trying to stop the hulk. At the same time, we see the hulk rampaging through a building that he's being held in. It goes to show that Lee can take a completely commercial film and give it a real creative touch. All in all, `The Hulk' is flat out great. It's a summer blockbuster that actually should be a model for other summer films that just have rehashed plots, poor acting, and only grab attention by throwing action and visual effects at the audience. What's more, `The Hulk' is truly one the best comic adapted films in the genre. It can proudly take its place among other noteworthy graphic novel adaptations such as Tim Burton's `Batman,' or `The Crow.' ***1/2",9.0,27 June 2003
why does everyone prefer spiderman to this?,"My goodness Ang Lee is a talent! Not only does he bring a rich and detailed comic book world very much to life, he also makes what could have been another bland attempt (batman, spiderman, Judge Dredd) at the genre into an astoundingly deep and thought provoking film. I found myself rivited by the effects coupled with the intricate plot, for they are truly a step ahead of the rest at the moment. I laugh at people when they say ""waah, nothing happens for an hour!!"" well, that is a dull inexperienced view for a little thing known as character development. If the film had started with action i would have been disappointed because Stan Lees vision wasn't of just mindless destruction, but an intricate story with intelligent undertones and evolving characters. Ang lee has used his unique talent to take a slightly different view on what could have been another rubbish spiderman clone. The cast are superb in their roles (Eric Bana is fast becoming a favourite of mine) and the CGI is out of this world. all in all, a fantastic film.

"Yes, Yes, it's all a rich tapestry!*","Ludicrous as it may seem to some, reviewing ""(The Incredible) Hulk"" (movie, comic, or otherwise) is like sampling every course in a smorgasbord. It abounds with numerous pithy and substantial themes, some classical, some Shakespearean, others mythological, from Oedipal and paternal conflict, to emotional and psychological abuse and repression, to the essence of true identity (is ""Bruce Banner"" merely the facade, and ""Hulk"" the real personality, as his own megalomaniacal father Dr. David Banner (Nick Nolte) mentions late in the film), to the intoxicating freedom of self-discovery. The movie is a skillfully constructed melange of other literary and cinematic works, from the obvious (""Frankenstein"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"") to the more arcane, bizarre, and obscure (""Altered States,"" ""The Island of Dr. Moreau,"" ""Swamp Thing!"", and yes, I do dare declare it, ""Superman: the Movie""). Ang Lee has attempted to create an epic drama from a deceptively simplistic and superficial ""creature"" and has succeeded admirably. All the characters reveal vulnerability, dimension, and soul. I was transfixed watching this spectacle, and the Hulk, come to triumphant life.

Anyone, I believe, caring to invest a modicum of thought and interest in the movie's unfolding should not have had any reason to be bored. In this sumptuous buffet of a movie, the first 45 minutes of exposition were not merely nutritious ""vegetables"", but the essential meat fleshing out the enigma that is the reserved, diffident Bruce Banner and explaining his frustrating emotional constipation (Eric Bana managed to convey this stoicism and simultaneously evoke my sympathy, just as David Jansen did as Richard Kimble in ""The Fugitive"", yet another inspiration). His interaction with Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) was fascinating and seminal because although she claimed to be disillusioned with Bruce's impassivity, inevitably she could never cut herself away from him because, as the backdrop of her life demonstrated, she, too, is Bruce's alter ego and soulmate, destined to help in his healing and salvation.

Despite the corncopia of themes this percolating cauldron of a movie swirls around, I feel ""Hulk"" is ultimately a movie dealing with the triumph of self-discovery, catharsis, and redemption. Bruce was doomed to an eternal prison of self-ignorance and loneliness inflicted by his wildly iconoclastic, obsessed father. Ironically, the gamma radiation gives him the key, because, like the potion in Swamp Thing, the rays did not transform him, but made him more of what he truly is. It is as the Hulk that Bruce salvages lost memories of his traumatic childhood. It is as the Hulk that Bruce retaliates against specific tormentors, rather than indiscrimately attack everyone in sight (as a truly mindless monster will). It is as the Hulk that Bruce embraces the heady feeling of power and freedom and begins to examine himself at the same time. Hulk is often described as a ""tragic figure"" and ample evidence exists of that in the movie, with his anguished roars of wrath and pain, his innocent, soulful stares when he is relatively calm, and, yes, his attempts to put his power to good use (e.g., saving Betty from the freakish Hulk dogs and (in my opinion) trying to save the jet from crashing into the Golden Gate Bridge. I think Ang Lee was trying to chronicle the birth of a new ""Superman"", crude, terrifying, and unrelenting at first, but striving to become a true, caring, FORGIVING, superhero (as he demonstrates when he shakes the soldiers out of the tank turret before destroying it and during his cathartic, climactic battle with his berserk, ""Absorbing Man"" father). Ultimately, Ang Lee transcends the tragedy of the Hulk's origin to suggest that, with luck, Bruce/Hulk will overcome their horrific legacy and the uncomprehending hostility of mankind (a la X-men) to become a fully contributory and valuable member (not just a scientific genius) of the world.

As you can see, I could turn the ""Hulk"" into a Ph.d dissertation. I am sure some graduate student already has. Yet, lest you think I am some verbose intellectual snob, let me assure you I also enjoyed the Hulk's visceral as well as cerebral pleasure. The entire desert/San Francisco battle sequence was taut, exciting, and exhilarating. The CGI behemoth, I felt, was utterly convincing and compelling, both in close-up and during his prodigious, soaring leaps. Hulk's phenomenal powers themselves are not a curse, as Roger Ebert mentioned in his review, but a blessing in an ""inhuman disguise"". Hulk revels in his power; during one of his stratospheric leaps, he actually reminded me of Superman in the 1978 movie just soaring through the air for the sheer joy of it. Also, Hulk runs better than the adolescent Superman in the 1978 film.

In conclusion, I believe Ang Lee successfully delivered both an intellectual and emotionally stimulating and evocative movie and created a respectful homage to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's classically archetypal character. To those reviewers who were bored with Hulk, let me respond with a paraphrase of a famous movie quote: ""'Hulk"" was a banquet, and most poor film watchers were starving to death.""

Needless to say, ""Hulk"" is a definite future DVD purchase I will treasure.

"Dark and Brooding, but Excellent","It is beyond me why 'Hulk' not more highly praised. The film is pure and has moments of utter destruction and power by the Hulk, great beauty, and style. This masterpiece by Ang Lee has it all in my opinion, a haunting musical score, moments of awesome action (especially the dog fight, and the tank and helicopter battle scenes in the desert). The isolation of the desert army base really suits the mood of the film, and is true to the original comic book. The moments where the hulk jumps and soars over the desert terrain are magical! The 'picture in picture' techniques used by Lee are also superb and echo the Hulk's print origins. Not to be overlooked is the acting. All the performances are also INCREDIBLE. Eric Bana is good as Bruce Banner, Nick Nolte is really great as his mad scientist father, Jennifer Connelly is so convincing (and beautiful!!) as Betty Ross, and the best performance is by Sam Elliott, who is tailor made to play the Betty's tough father, General Ross. He is great beyond words in this film! Watch 'Hulk' and prepare to be amazed, it is a masterpiece of the super-hero film genre. Spiderman was a good popcorn movie, 'Hulk' is much more!",8.0,13 May 2004
A very fine film,"""Hulk"" is an interesting film and one that is hard to put into a box. Luckily, you don't have to. It is beautifully and simply photographed by Fredrick Elmes. I marveled at the lengths Ang Lee and his writing team went through to give us a believable story with just the right touch of comic-book flare. The ending result is a pitch-perfect script, although a very quiet and cerebral one. Perhaps the scenes of whisperings and silence help to make the carnage of the action sequences all the more fantastic. Some do not like the film, I think because it does move at a slow pace and is not so accessible to the general public's attention spans. It's plot also does not follow the normal conventions of American action/sci-fi films and I think this tended to alienate some viewers. I was engrossed by this quality because I truly didn't know what would happen next in the story. Despite the initial negative reactions I think this film will be remembered in the future as one of the best comic-book adaptations from this era.",8.0,31 May 2006
Very well done,"Though not pertinent to compare, but The Hulk is the best of the comic book adaptations. And that's saying something because both X-Men movies and Spider-Man were each very good in their own right (I've not seen Daredevil, to this point). The storyline for The Hulk, obviously, was altered. Modernized, if you will, and very well, at that. The acting was good, also. This is a film, greatly, about a madman; a scientist gone insane and the effects his work, in his younger days, has had on his son as it has come to fruition (with the aid of some good old radiation) some twenty-five years later. The rest you will have to discover on your own. It will not be time ill spent. This is a quality movie, well beyond the ""comic book"" label. 9/10. Cheers.",10.0,28 June 2003
Ant look into Hulk,"After almost five years after the debut of Ang Lees ""Hulk"" i feel almost confused by the IMDb rating and the criticism that surrounds this movie, being not what i expected is still far from what should be reasonable to give when you come to face with ""The Incredible Hulk"".

In one hand we have this legion of angry fans always moaning about the somewhat shallow movies that are being made about their childhood or adulthood comic heroes and on the other hand we have also a legion of confused professional reviewers and critics that, lacking better words to define their knowledge of Ang Lees ""Hulk"", don't know a thing of what they are talking about. So we are left with a three-handed-monster and the base to its existence it is of course to believe in the words of ""Marvel"" fans with one inch of guts in their fingers to write and post a mimic play of what should be the work of professional reviewers mind and hands to do.

So, why this three-handed-monster balance when coming to face this movie? Ultimately, Ang Lees ""Hulk"" is without any kind of doubt the best comic hero novel export to the big screen and a minor masterpiece, standing on its own amongst any fantasy movie exploit that we can think of, and i dare not to say any names. It has balanced player setups, being the acting of both Mr. Eric Bana and Mr. Nick Nolte nailed with believable performances, and the others left with still this incredible effort of Mr. Ang Lee to assure every character is available to the viewers analysis because there is actually content to be watched and processed there, and not only one more name to fill up the plot. When it comes to plot ""cuisine"", this movie is completely delicious and goes where most movies of other genres baring thriller insignias aim to achieve but fail to complete. It has a very simple and linear way of get there, sure we are talking about a comic hero movie, but it nails the motive and the essence of the story that its being told to the viewer, never trying to inject any false pretensions of what is going on inside the movie and of what this movie is all about: the story of how ""The Incredible Hulk"" came to exist, in a way you wont find in any other movie of the genre and you wish you could find in hundreds of other movie genres.",9.0,9 March 2008
Ang Lee's Hulk is not a comic movie. It's something much rarer and more difficult to pull off: a SCIENCE MOVIE.,"Not even a fun ""summer blockbuster sci-fi"" like The Fifth Element or Aeon Flux. 80% of Hulk is the first Aliens movie. It's Gattaca. ""The movie of the science"" with a liberal sprinkling of horror: a lab glass out of place, a door ajar, a haunted scientist, a monster unseen. Cinematically, it's dramatic pauses and shadowed halls. Ang Lee channels Kubrick and Hitchcock to create THAT movie quite well...which is especially impressive since Hulk's science is pure nonsense.

Audiences keyed up for a summer blockbuster smash movie ended up watching Ang Lee's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for over 90 minutes before a proper smash movie even begins to take shape.

Naturally they spent most of the movie thinking, ""WTF am I even watching?""",8.0,25 July 2023
Pure Masterpiece,"Reviewer s-kubrick has it right-on. Speaking on behalf of most hardcore action junkie, I was looking for some senseless fx/action flick. My first impression after watching this movie was that they should have focused less on the drama. They second time I watched it, I was quite impressed by the creativity behind the Hulk and action sequences. It left me wanting for more. And that feeling put's you in a bad mood. The third time around, I notice the masterpiece behind the drama, the first class acting, and breath taking cinematography. Mr Ang Lee's Hulk should have gotten an award for best picture to say the least. Papa Hulk is so mesmerizing. There are some many things to love about this movie. This is truly a complete movie. Among the finest ever made. Thank you to all the people behind it's creation.",10.0,15 July 2008
A rare gem,"I may be the only person I know who actually likes this movie,and the only one I know who believes it to be superior to the new hulk movie. This is a very different comic book movie,one that takes time to develop the inner conflicts of a character,and here that is very compelling. We witnes Bruce Banner's tortured past,how he is holding onto a dark seceret. This add extra layers to the film as his father comes into play(the reason he is so tormented) The story is about him manifesting all his internal problems physically,enter the Hulk. The Hulk is the opposite of Banner,barbaric and powerful. able to accomplish incredible feats of superhuman strength but simple in intelligence. He is everything Banner isn't and is able to express the rage banner has bottled up. I find this story very compelling,the actors are all well cast and strong and the action scenes are very good. One thing I could never understand is why people ripped on the special effects in this movie,they are startlingly real looking and astonishing to look at. I also believe that the action scenes in this movie are more epic and emotionally fueled. From the dog fight to the epic battle in the desert to the final confrontation,it is epic",8.0,16 February 2012
"Stylish, exciting, touching, but not for everyone","Being a big fan of the old Lou Ferrigno TV series and having seen the trailers, as well as being a long-time fan of Ang Lee, my hopes were sky high for this one to be my film of the summer, maybe the year. Well, it wasn't, but that doesn't mean it was a wash-out. It just wasn't the film that we had been promised by the trailers. That's probably because this is a hard-sell from the film that Lee delivered.

If you want mad, rampaging Hulk action, its there - in spades - for the best part of an hour. Its beautifully shot, well-designed and exciting, not to mention highly amusing. Watching ""Hulk Smash"" those tanks is pure geek nirvana, displaying a helluva lot of character at the same time. However, either side is a lot of exposition, with a good 45 mins or so of setup before the Hulk is unleashed. Suffice to say, when he is, it's glorious.

But there is alot more going on here. Ang Lee's films are about repression. Here it is about a child so scared of letting his rage get the better of him that he has grown into a man unable to express almost any emotions because he's hidden from them for so long. As such, he doesn't know his dad and is unable to tell Betty (the never-more-luminescent or effective Jennifer Connelly) how he feels for her.

When his father (the always great Nick Nolte) turns up after years in the wilderness, his rage begins to re-emerge. That's when the action kicks in. There are surreal asides throughout - the Hulk dog fight is a joy, but weird. Nolte's developing strengths are touched upon before being explored more towards the end and, because it comes as such a surprise, can seem like an afterthought and a bizarre one at that.

The final twenty minutes or so, while in many ways the perfect wrapping up of all the issues Lee raises, are both surprising and confusing. Perhaps an extra five or ten minutes in the climactic scenes might have given a bit more weight to a slightly soggy ending to what is largely a thrilling film.

On the plus side, the editing - while slightly over the top - is at times very subtle in its handling of several subjects at once and this is the closest to comic book framing that there has been. It really does feel and move like a comic book. The cinematography, though a little dark in some scenes at night, is gorgeous, particularly when we are in the military base or out on the mesas. The scoring is fine, the acting excellent from the four leads - Bana is well-cast as Banner, Connelly continues to extend her range and grow in beauty, Nolte is gruff (of course) and believable as a bit of a nutjob and Sam Elliot does what he does best, while sharing a few more personal scenes with Connelly. The only false step is Josh Lucas who doesn't have much to work with, but he gets his in due course...

Finally, the much-debated effects. In the early Hulk scenes, he is difficult to see and it feels as though they may be hiding what they couldn't muster. But once he lets rip in the daylight, i stopped looking for the joins and just went with it. He looks a bit goofy at points, but then he's a several ton green giant in purple shorts, so what did you expect? I loved him and he looked like the Hulk to me. His roll down the dunes is flawless fx work in my book, as is his transformation into Banner in San Francisco.

Its not the best film Lee has made (a toss-up between Crouching Tiger and The Ice Storm), nor the best comic book movie (X2?), but it is something different in a summer of sequels and knock-offs. Well worth a watch, but go in with an open mind and you will find it all the more rewarding.

Good,The movie is not only action and adventurous but also I would consider it a comedy.. good movie .. :),8.0,16 July 2019
A comic book movie that seriously considers its characters,"Hulk is not the usual superhero movie. There are exciting action sequences but the movie on the whole doesn't leave you feeling exhilarated, but rather sombre. Ang Lee has made a more thoughtful movie, which actually tries to develop its characters, and is interested in the relationship between Bruce and David Banner and Betty and General Ross and the resulting relationship between Bruce and Betty.

First of all Betty. Her father is a career military man and has always been distant from her. She wants to be closer to him, but it seems clear that he doesn't quite know how to do that. She trusts him at times during this film, and those times prove to be detrimental to Bruce Banner.

Bruce Banner in this film is the walking wounded though he doesn't even know it. There is deep trauma in his early childhood and he has buried in down. He loves science and that's the only thing that seems to animate him. He loves Betty as well but can't open up to her - he just doesn't seem to be able to. He's repressed and he often awakens from nightmares that he doesn't understand, and doesn't want to. General Ross scorns Bruce's father and distrusts Bruce as well. David Banner, a military scientist, experimented on himself and passed the changes onto his son and he loves Bruce as the outcome of an experiment and nothing more. After the accident takes place, Bruce isn't able to repress all the time and clamp down on his feelings. Instead he lets go and becomes the Hulk.

After two viewings, I realized how expressive the Hulk really is. The Hulk is Bruce's Id set loose. When he's not bothered, the Hulk is quiet and still. He looks closely at the desert flowers. When provoked, he replies in kind without hesitation. He is the four year old Bruce, full of pain and frustration, but this time supremely powerful and able to fight back. His roars at one or two points in the movie are roars of hurt and frustration, of a giant child who is desperately unhappy and angry. There are also moments when he is tender. When the rampaging Hulk sees Betty in a helicopter, he halts his attack, his anger gone at once, seeming almost wistful and ashamed at the same time. There is another, shorter moment when the leaping Hulk comes to Bruce's childhood home in a military base. He studies the house and we see the Hulk swallow a sob as some memory of Bruce's childhood returns to him.

The Hulk, in the comics, is never a happy story. Betty is always longing for relationships with her father and Bruce, while Bruce is terribly scarred by what his father has done to him. The only way he can fight back is through the Hulk, and becoming the Hulk has repercussions. He is unhappy as Bruce and targeted as the Hulk. The leads in this movie are dysfunctional people, and the movie deals with them in a serious, even realistic way of a dramatic film. The Hulk is not a normal popcorn superhero movie. It doesn't deserve to be one.",10.0,10 May 2004
'Hulk' too big for his purple daisy dukes,"I had the pleasure of seeing 'Hulk' in San Francisco, the city in which the film takes place. Now, many people thought the movie is slow, which it is, and boring, which it's not, and ultimately too brainy for average movie viewers to comprehend. The plot revolves around Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) who's character in this movie seems to go undefined, and his on/off gal pal Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). In a freak lab accident (or so it seems), Banner is pelted with radioactive gamma rays that, when triggered by anger, transforms Banner into a giant green behemoth. The plot then unravels to show the involvement of Bruce's estranged father David (Nick Nolte). Also, Betty's father, General 'Thunderbolt' Ross (Sam Elliot) and Major Talbot (the sleek Josh Lucas), trying to find and contain Banner's destructive alter ego in hopes to replicate the formula to breed an army of Hulk-Soldiers to fight for Uncle Sam. I can't tell you much more then that without spoiling the rest of the movie. But, unlike the comic, this movie does not dwell on the exploits of the Hulk, but rather Banner's destructive and haunted past. And mostly on how the genesis of his power began. This movie is overly long at about 2 and a half hours, but the movie has merit as a movie unto it self. Bana's and especially Nolte's performances were extraordinary. Most notably in one of their final confrontations toward the end of the film. The Hulk looks very good, the CGI was wonderful. And the way the that director Ang Lee uses multi-angle sequences to pay homage to the multi-panel look of comic books was very refreshing. But in the quest to deliver a 'Greek Tragedy' of sorts, he forgot his target audience. The action movie junkies. The kids who watch cartoons on Saturday morning. This movie is too grown up for them to understand, or care about. That being said, the movie would have suffered alot less if it hadn't tried to be a thinking man's film. Finishing on a lighter note, I loved the cameo appearance of 'Hulk' creator Stan Lee and 'Incredible Hulk' TV star Lou Ferrigno as Security Guards. One hopes they will make a spin off film or TV series of their exploits

RATING: *** out of ****",9.0,15 July 2003
Definitely worth it!,"I highly recommend this movie. I found the time to delve into the Bruce's origin worthwhile, as it was inventive (it deviates from the comic books) and compelling.

Yes, it's not frame to frame mayhem and destruction. But, the action is well placed and thoroughly in tune with the rest of the movie. In other words, the action does not overwhelm the narrative.

I saw the mini features for The Hulk on the SciFi channel and formed a negative impression of the CGI effects. But after seeing the effects in the context of the entire film, I say BRAVO. The Hulks facial expressions makes it really easy for the viewer to have empathy for his confusion and rage.

What a story! Again the critics have it wrong. This a mature person's action film.",9.0,29 June 2003
"The vicarious thrill of it all is so cathartic, so much fun, you'll practically have to stop yourself from shouting, ""Grrr..Hulk smash!"" to the screen.","Unlike popular perception, the Hulk is a monster and a curse, not a superhero, who is supposed to instill fear and awe in `puny humans.' The movie comes close at times, but with a $150 million budget, you'd think we'd be more afraid of this CGI Hulk than Lou Ferrigno's fright- wig-and-green-body-paint version - we're not. Still, the scenes where the Hulk is in action are fresh and exciting enough that the film well earns your nine-plus dollars. The snail-paced, `human' scenes, however, just seem to hang there more lifelessly than the screen curtain. At least these occasionally joyless moments will give you plenty of time to get more popcorn and take a leak, or even a long, luxurious dump, depending on where you are in the two-and-a-half hour movie.

While the action sequences are truly great, it bothered me that the original comic book storyline was actually toned down, believe it or not, to the detriment of the film's believability (isn't the stereotype supposed to be that comic books are the kids' medium?).

In the comic, Bruce Banner's father is a physically and verbally abusive, raging alcoholic who beat Bruce's mother to death. After witnessing this, young Banner fell to the floor, emotionally frozen, cradling his mother's bloody corpse without shedding so much as a single tear. In the film, the father is a mad scientist who, in one clumsily staged piece, accidentally falls on someone with a knife. I guess a murderous father with a drinking problem doesn't make for a best-selling action figure.

The emotional impact was further softened when Ang Lee jumbled up the character's history and muddled the story in an attempt to make this a more ""personal"" film. Add up the incessant comic-strip-style, multiple-screen-splitting (which after a while grows into more of a tiresome distraction than an innovation), the Enigma-esque background music (enough with the idea that wailing and chanting automatically translates into a movie being soulful), and angst-ridden, soft-spoken dialogue (WHY IS EVERYBODY WHISPERING? WHAT'S THE SECRET?!?!? HERE'S AN IDEA -- EVEN TORTURED SOULS SPEAK UP EVERY NOW AND THEN, GODDAMMIT!!!), and you have an often self-indulgent, art-house-wannabe film that should have been called THE INCREDIBLE ANG LEE'S hulk.

Great directors and screenwriters are supposed to know when to get themselves and their egos out of the way of a story. The people behind this tale apparently never learned that Screenwriting 101 lesson. Nor did they learn that just because you're writing a comic book story doesn't mean it's okay to stuff it with bad-daytime-soap-opera-level exchanges such as one silly scene where General Ross tell his daughter, `I'm sorry,' and she responds, with predictable earnestness, `I know.' Second-rate comic book writers, at their cliché', hyperbole-loving worst, would have known better.

Throughout the film, Eric Bana's, Jennifer Connely's, and Sam Elliot's acting, much like the uneven script, runs the gamut of impressive creative achievement to borderline-embarrassing hack work.

As for Nick Nolte, well, he's very busy doing something on the screen, but I'm not sure if you can technically call it acting. He's running around stalking people, shooting himself up with experimental drugs, and biting into electric cables. I had a funny feeling this is what he'd be doing even if there wasn't a movie happening around him. I'm being kind when I say his portrayal of David Banner had more ham in it than Mama Cass in '74.

Since such a large chunk of the film's production time was wrapped up in just coming up with the look of the Hulk, I'm hoping that when the sequel arrives he'll appear much more, well.incredible, and a great deal more savage. You'll surely admire the humanity in Hulk's face (unlike the previews, the Hulk comes across as a better-than-average CGI accomplishment). And you'll probably be surprised how quickly you'll forget the whole `support the troops' business and start rooting for a giant, green monster run amok to crush all of our military defense forces while causing as much collateral damage as possible to our very own streets, homes, trees, government buildings, sewers, and even a poodle.

In fact, the vicarious thrill of it all is so cathartic, so much fun, you'll practically have to stop yourself from shouting, ""Grrr..Hulk smash!"" to the screen.

But that's not the point of the Hulk (not the whole point, at least); he's supposed to have you trembling in your seats. This one just made me a little shakier than usual.",10.0,22 June 2003
Most Psychological SuperHero movie,"i'm sure most comic book fans will disagree with me, but when a comic is adapted to a movie changes must be made, and only what will work as a FILM must be kept. Ang Lee did this very well. his mistake was that he aimed this movie at adults and not the younger audience. But as far as character depth is concerned, it doesn't get much deeper than this!

Yes the parts that people had problems with the comic-film transition; the fathers' connection with injecting a serum into him bruce as a child. This only heightened his anger towards the father. The other reason for adding this change was due to the fact that the popularity of RADIATION-MUTANTS is not there anymore. Ang Lee did his research right; in the 40s-50s most movies, comics, cartoons had the themes of radiated creatures ranging from ants to earthworms(yes there was an old B&W movie that i saw). That is such a primitive idea, the audience of today is far more intelligent of general knowledge that it would not have been accepted. This is why he added a more complex twist.

Others have been angered that his father becomes ABSORBING MAN. This too was done for a story reason. it would have been difficult to bring a character out of the blue and connect it to the way the story was moving. I do agree that there should have been more action, and the Dogs were Definitely a bad idea, should have scrapped that Lee. The camera-work with the panels, very appropriate.

it was brilliant, and i can't wait for the sequel.",9.0,12 March 2006
Not perfect but rather underrated,"The Hulk is far from perfect, but it does seem to get a rough ride from a lot of people. And as for people calling it, ""the worst movie ever made"", oh please, it's not even close.

I'd commend Hulk for being an ambitious film. At least director Ang Lee has tried to do something different with a 'summer blockbuster', and for all it's faults there are a lot of pluses.

Yes the film is to long with far to many 'character development' scenes that slow the film down. A lot of these scenes could have been cut without damaging the film. In fact the film is probably a half hour to long. I think if the film were 1 hour 40 minutes it would have been a much better movie. How about a shorter directors cut!

I find the action scenes with The Hulk very enjoyable, and straight out of the comic book. The sequences where Hulk battles the army are the best in the film, and i loved the bit where he clings to the fighter jet! The climax is a huge disappointment as well as being confusing and at a time when the film has run it's course. It's never clear what Nick Nolte's character becomes or what he's trying to achieve.

Still, worth checking out for all it's faults, and probably worth seeing again if you've only seen it once. The comic panel editing though skillfully done can get annoying, but the film does look superb and has a good score by Danny Elfman.",8.0,7 April 2005
Brilliant filmmaking!,"Roger Ebert said the Hulk was a comic book movie for people who wouldn't be caught dead watching a comic book movie. Well, I'm one of the people who wouldn't be caught dead watching not only a comic book movie but any summer blockbusters. I'm much more an arthouse and foreign film fan. The last comic book movie I remember seeing was the first Batman. I thought that's lightweight fun. I don't remember much from that movie, but I do remember it didn't touch me emotionally in any way. Hey, it's a comic book movie! The Hulk is a completely different film. It's a suspense drama based on a comic book and what a brilliant filmmaking this is!

The way the filmmaker told us the story made us emotionally feel for the Hulk. He withheld the Hulk's source of rage until close to the end. When it's revealed, it's so powerful that it made me burst into tears. Sorry, US Army. Love you guys, but I was rooting for the Hulk all the way because of the emotional investment I put in the Bruce Banner character as the story unfolded.

And what a stunning visual style Ang Lee adapted to tell the story! He made scientific experiments look cool! All the shots of blood, DNA, eyes, atomic bomb explosions were amazing. I was awe struck by all the inventive transitions and all the morphings from one image to another. The style is not like the classical beauty of Crouching Tiger, rather, it's more like an edgy, abstract contemporary art. Yes, Ang Lee proved a comic book movie CAN be art. And I love the opening credit segment! It laid out the framework of the story in such a visually stunning way!

The acting was good all around. I thought Eric Bana and Sam Elliot were excellent in their respective role. Nick Nolte was a bit over the top, but the role seems to require it. The father-and-son confrontation toward the end was almost like dramatic stage play. Great performances by Nolte and Bana. The fact that Bana held his own on that stage versus a theme-stealing Nolte proves to me that he's not just a pretty face. He can act. Jennifer Connelly's performance was restraint but good. Her face while holding Bruce after the mayhem in SF was heartbreaking. I wish Lee would show her face after hearing the news of the bomb rather than Elliot's. Her character was the emotion center of the Hulk, not her father.

This is a film that doesn't spell out everything. It requires the audience to think. The psychological battles waging in Bruce Banner's head were revealed in dreams and images. After I saw it for the first time last week, I wasn't clear on some of the points of the story and thought the film had a few flaws. I just saw the film for the second time and I thought everything was brilliantly done. In its core, the Hulk is an arthouse comic book movie. It's made for adults who appreciate their entertainment with a brain and a heart, even in summertime.",9.0,28 June 2003
Cream of the Crap!,"As super hero movies/comic conversions go for me The Hulk is the best. The Hulk is not an all out action flick of any description by my standards but a detailed description of one man's struggle with what he does not want and does not understand.

The movie is so deep and visual in almost every scene and sense. The colours in this movie are flawless with unbelievable shots of scenery and events when they unfold in their own superbly pulled off climax. The acting is impressive to say the least especially by Nolte. He really shows what he is still capable of in this movie given the chance and (as i can guess) motivation.

Brains created Brawn. But Brawn's much cooler!,"I saw the Hulk on the day after it came out, June 21, 2003. The Hulk is the best Marvel movie I have seen since X2. The Hulk has got great effects and an interesting story. The Hulk is full of action and everyone just loves seeing the green giant fight. Plus, he's huge! And he jumps really high!! I must say, Ang Lee surely did a great job on directing the movie. I can't wait to play the video game! The Hulk is action-packed and Hulk's just causing mayhem and destruction! Great job, Marvel! Now we must wait for our next Marvel film, Spider-Man II!",8.0,21 June 2003
Excellence,"I saw ""The Hulk"" on opening day, like I do for all Marvel Movies. I'll admit that, even though I'm a huge Marvel fan(atic), I was a little doubtful about this movie. I had seen the Super Bowl Trailer, and was a little disappointed, but I was (Thankfully) proved wrong. Ang Lee has done a wonderful job directing this movie, he has included cut-a-ways that just make this such a great comic-book movie. The CGI Hulk was impressive, the one part that I didn't fully believe he was real was his first transformation, he was too bright green, I think. Other than that, think ""Cave Troll"" from ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" but improve on that technology about 100 times. A very well done movie, I will definitely be seeing it again.",10.0,20 June 2003
The Hulk's Cinematic Transformation,"The latest comic book adaptation to hit the screen is Ang Lee's ""The Hulk."" Here, Lee brings the popular Marvel comic to life, literally. Many times the screen is shot too look like comic book panels. The story does take certain liberties with the origin of the Incredible Hulk. Although I did find it interesting how natural science was used to explain some of Dr. Bruce Banner's transformation (i.e., jellyfish for his green coloration, starfish for his regenerative powers, etc.). Another good point is the excellent CGI work used to create the Hulk. It certainly looks better than it did in the TV spots! The scene in which the Hulk battles the giant mutated dogs is very memorable. Where else can you see a poodle so frightening? All the while, you can just see the humanity beneath the green exterior. The Hulk's rage may be blinding and consuming, but he can still show some intelligence and compassion. This is the superhero that appeals to the angry feelings deep down inside us all.",8.0,1 July 2003
Deeper than anything I've seen in this genre,"I think people looking for fluff or mindless action movies (ala X2) will be very disappointed with Hulk. I don't even consider it in the same league as most recent Marvel movies. Spiderman was very good, but was ultimately a light-hearted positive movie. This is every bit just as good, but entirely opposite in tone. Why is there an outcry against it (at least in several reviews)? As I see it, this film has been advertised to the wrong audience. It appears as though the studio marketing people suddenly pushed it as an action blockbuster when they realized Ang Lee had made a much more intellectual, darker take on the comic series than they thought he would have. They panicked and wanted to try the big-opening-weekend tactic to generate money. I read all the negative reviews and went into it without high hopes. But I was blown away. The effects shots, while mostly very well done, are the least important to me. Ang has made real human characters out if these roles. Truth is, Ang's Hulk is a psychological story about childhood trauma and dealing with parents and their control. The real subtext is children having to deal with the choices their parents made...when it inevitably shapes who they are as adults. It could have been told against a more mundane background, but the Hulk part of it just gives it a fun twist. The characters are forced into situations beyond their control, yet they have to to try and deal with it nonetheless. Bruce is emotionally distant due to a fractured childhood (a protective response)...Betty is obsessed with trying to emotionally ""open up"" such a guy, since she could never do that to her military father (and thus fix their relationship). The two lead characters (Bruce & Betty) love each other deeply, but events and psychological scars conspire against them...and ultimately separate them. This is a classic tragedy story. I think people aren't used to that and they have a very strong negative reaction. The expectation was for lighthearted, humorous summer fluff, but they got handed heavy Greek tragedy instead. No wonder the negative reviews. All I can say is that I will definitely be paying to see this film again while it's in the theaters. I expect a lot of people to ""not get it."" Those who do will hold this film in high regards. I agree that Ang Lee is one of the most talented directors of our time. Highly recommended if characters mean more to you than action.",10.0,22 June 2003
Best marvel comic movie yet!!!,"I don't quite understand all the negative feelings and reviews surrounding this movie. This is a GREAT movie. There's action, drama, and the story line and cinematography is awesome!!! The only people who don't lie this movie are dullards!! There's no way  it has everything!!! There's something for everybody except a kid under 8.-(which by the way I had to sit in front oftalked the whole movie, and I still loved it!!!) This movie was awesome.head and shoulders above Spiderman. (Spiderman being my favorite marvel hero) Spiderman tried to relate to a certain age group. It looked like it was filmed on a set. This was a movie made for the sake of making a movie. That's what makes it so great. If you can appreciate a movie, you will like this movie. And it has talent. If you go in with a pre-formed opinion, you'll come out with one. If you just can't get it, can't follow the story line, have a short attention span, you won't like it either. It takes some intelligence and attention to follow the plot. All the people that I've spoken with who have reserve of with this movie (without even seeing it), are hung up on the hulk as it was for TV with Lou Farigno. If you think the hulk should have been some bodybuilder in a suit.get over yourself. Get with the times! These/you same people would be the ones to criticize it if they put someone in a suit, saying `they should have used a computer generated characterwhat with all this technology. Put it to some use!!! They did this movie top notchcouldn't have been better. If you think you could do bettermake a suggestion!!! There are scenes where the hulks hair is blowing in the breeze!! I was amazed. It was unbelievable!!! Let me tell you I don't vote movies lightly. I see every movie that comes out. I am just a movie buffit's my hobby. This makes my comment credible, unlike some of these other fools. I recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys an overall great movie. It has everything your looking for in just the right amount. Character development, great plot, action, cinematography, great acting and special effects.

By far THE BEST MARVEL/ACTION MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!!!",10.0,20 June 2003

Now I will say though it's not as good as the other marvel movies that have come out like X-Men, X2, Spider-man, & Daredevil but still good. Though it does seem to take a while to actually see the Hulk it's still worth seeing. The effects in the movie are great. All the scenes that involve Hulk are basically with him destroying something but the action is just so cool. Now I see why people dis the movie and I am not one but if you here bad things about it just ignore it and see it, it is worth seeing. you never know you might even enjoy it.",8.0,16 July 2003
Just good,"Now i admit the movie did start of kind of slowly, but it was well worth the wait, i mean when the Hulk first changed it was just like the comic is coming alive and he did look awesome, i dont know why people are bagging it, as many paople have said how can you make a 7-12 foot monster realistic looking, its pretty damn hard and this movie makes it realistic as it could be. When the Hulk went ona a rage...he went on a rage! it was a blast, everytime he was beggining to change i would curl up in my seat and got ready to be entertained, now i admit that at times the movie moved a little slow and that little kids will probably not like it much but if your in the mood for a movie that makes you think and makes you wanna smash, the Hulk it for you.",9.0,21 June 2003

Breathtaking,"I have been a fan of the Hulk for many years, and I religiously followed the production footsteps of this movie. When I sat down to watch this film I was mildly shaking with anticipation and my adrenaline level was increased, I was so engrossed in this film. The background information on Banner was an important element to the film and when the hulk appeared first of all I was in awe. The amount of work gone into the detail of the Hulk I can only applaud the guys at ILM for.

The Desert scenes were breathtaking and the whole cinematography was awesome, everything about this film was awesome. Some have critized this film on its lack of humour and tendencey to be dark, this is basically a tragic story of a mans affliction with a disease, its not meant to be light hearted, and funny.

This film is not meant to be like spiderman in any way, its darker and more intelligent its witty and truly is a work of art. I thank the whole production team for bringing back a character I have loved since I was a young boy. I eagerly await the sequel. This film may not be for every one, perhaps children found the first 45 minutes boring as did some adults but hey it needs a good story, and I felt it lead to a great climax in the film ,the acting was superb, and was pretty much an adult film. I give this film a 10.",10.0,13 July 2003
A standout comic-character film,"You will either love or hate ""Hulk"". If you haven't already worked this out by the difference in opinions left by other posters on this board, keep it in the front of your mind when watching this movie.

""Hulk"" is a very different comic book film. It stands out in the field by making the ""Hulk"" a decidedly non-heroic character. Bruce Banner (underplayed by Eric Bana - decide for yourself if he is playing a repressed character or just can't act; I think the former) certainly isn't someone you'd envy. He has just broken up with his girlfriend (Betty Ross played by Jennifer Connolly who actually makes a believable scientist) but still has to work with her. His experiments aren't going well. A potential suitor for both Betty and Banner's research is lurking around the laboratories (Talbot - an obvious bad guy as portrayed by Josh Lucas). Someone claiming to be his father appears, claiming Bruce's life to be a lie as he knows it. On top of this Banner continues to have nightmares that have plagued him all his life. Bruce is under pressure.

As expected, an accident in the lab causes Bruce Banner to be bombarded by gamma radiation which in turn leads to his transformation into the Hulk. The best scenes in this movie involve the Hulk. For all the lashing out the Hulk does at whatever is striking him, this film does a fantastic job of showing that all Hulk / Banner really wants is some peace. It is in these touches of soul that ""Hulk"" shows itself as an exceptional comic-book adaption.

This isn't to say that ""Hulk"" isn't flawed - it has moments that run too long, while some of the dialogue just doesn't flow. It also isn't the action film that some fans expect with the climatic battle at the film's end being perhaps unnecessary. But these are small points if you can enjoy the rest of the film. If you don't enjoy the rest of film though... well, there are enough negative user comments on this board to tell you what to expect.

Ang Lee has managed to direct another amazing film that looks at a genre in a unique way. The Hulk CGI will date, but works very well in the scenes environments and looks believable. Although ""Hulk"" won't be the blockbuster hit of the summer, it has cult written all over it and will talked about long after ""Daredevil"" and ""T3"" have become mere footnotes of 2003.",8.0,3 July 2003
"Comic Book Fans of the Hulk, rejoice!","RAAARRGH! HULK SMASH!

What a dissapointment!,Thats basically all I have to say. What a dissapointment. Not that it was a bad movie. It was ok. I just thought they could have done with out the first 20 minutes when they were looking over past events in his life. If they were going to do that dont do it so long.

Nick Nolte was brilliant to play the father. Along with this movies a hell lot of action and tragedy, a battle for survival and battle for his fathers love. Ang Lee combines the action and tragedy with brilliant sound that suits its purpose. i would highly advise anybody, even if you have never heard of the hulk, to go and watch this movie. this is a powerhouse of a movie",10.0,11 July 2003
by far the most superior super hero film!,"Wow what a film!

By far the best super hero film ever, easily the best summer movie this year and quite simply breath taking!

Great script, solid acting, superb effects and stunning directing!

Ang Lee recreates a comic on the big screen, never before has any super hero film come to life like this. From the split screen cameras to the screen wipes it just oozes class and actually creates that missing element from all other comic book adaptations. The directing is what makes the film and just shows what you can acheive when a great director is put in charge of a project like this.

The film is a dark brooding 'hulk' of a film. One mans struggle against the beast within himself.

Be warned this is not a film for kids, anyone under the age of say 15 will not like this film. Also if your a cheap main stream junky then I suggest you go and watch Armageddon or some such other tat. It has very little action probably only about 5 scenes but it is crammed full of character building, drama and tension. However when the action does hit its stunning Hulk is recreated on the screen exactly as you would picture him in all his green glory.

Character-driven drama,"Hey, the film's actually not bad! I walked out of the theater feeling slightly dizzy, a feeling I get after watching movies such as The Pianist or The Hours. What that implies is that Ang Lee was probably trying for another Oscar, somehow, though hardly in the acting department (not that Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly weren't good, just that ... comic-book Oscar winners, anyone?). They do have a chance in editing and a slight one in special effects though. People who watch this film should, as most of the other positive-reviewers agree, watch this as a drama - go in with your expectations programmed like you're going to watch Road To Perdition or something. The action is more a representation of his anger, and I loved how intense it was. There were even attempts to make it look realistic in an already unrealistic Hulk-comic-book world - the way Hulk landed he stil had to hop another step to break his jump. Basically, it's all about emotions. Just that, all about emotions (that means you, the audience, not only the movie).",10.0,16 July 2003
a spectacular cinematic achievement.,"bizarrely underrated. an incredibly accomplished and beautiful piece of film making. faithful in all aspects to the essence and mythology of the comic book character, but also imbued with depth, subtlety, and lyricism. the directors individual style and flair is stamped all over the movie and imparts it with a gravitas that has not yet been seen in any summer popcorn flick. the photography and use of imagery is mesmerising, and the remarkable use of editing adds to the beauty. lee has shown that he is master of action directing. several of the key sequences are fantastically entertaining. the quality of the special effects and the CGI work on the hulk character himself is seamless and is probably the best work that ILM has produced to this date. astonishing. a surprisingly underrated gem that has obviously been a labour of love for all those involved in its making. hats off to lee, the producers, the screenwriters, and ILM. in my mind, certainly the best superhero film made to date, which is no mean feat considering the two xmen movies, and towers above spiderman and daredevil in terms of quality. makes one truly long for a sequel, and lets hope its not too far away.",10.0,21 July 2003
Not Half Bad,"Guided by the reviews when the film was released, I deliberately and carefully avoided seeing it in a theater. Now, I'm sorry. The movie is not nearly so bad as the general public was led to believe and is, in fact, quite effective and even, in parts, moving. Although these are not qualities one either expects (or even wants in a picture with comic book origins), they are also scarcely to be considered debilitating to the overall effectiveness of the project.

Much of the power of the film comes from the performances of two old pros, Nick Nolte (playing himself, before rehab) and Sam Elliott (playing himself). These old rhinos snort up all the air in every frame in which they appear. No one else can touch them, particularly not Eric Bana, whose profound rages come across as temper tantrums until the special effects kick in and he is wholly computer generated. The ""monster"" gives a particularly fine performance and his programmers are to be commended.

It is, on the whole, a very satisfying movie. And a badly underrated one.",8.0,16 May 2004
"Excellent, when taken on its own merits","This, to me, was a movie exploring characters, not the bang-up action that some may want. As far as Marvel movies go, it probably strides the farthest away from the original tale, but, when taken on its own, it works well.

The movie isn't all ""Hulk Smash!"" which is a good thing in my opinion. We see rage personified in Bruce Banner's alter-ego, along with the temptation to finally be free of the heavy control over one's emotions. The special effects were great (although there were some times when it was fairly obvious the Hulk was CG), but the movie wasn't about special effects. It was used to tell a story rather effectively.",9.0,21 June 2003
You're Making Me Angry...You wouldn't like me when I'm angry,"It makes me angry that so many people have panned this excellent and exciting version of the Hulk. What many movie goers remember is Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno. While this was good for the 70's, you have to remember a few things. Firstly, the comic book was based on Robert ""Bruce"" Banner, and the Hulk mutated because of a military accident. The TV show was based on David ""Bruce"" Banner, and was a medical experiment. The movie combines the two, eliminating the first name of Robert or David, and combining the storylines.

Secondly, in the comic, it took over 200 issues before any of his father's abuse to make itself known. (I blame the comic code, but that's just me.) This evolution of the character made Bruce Banner a much more interesting character. The Hulk isn't really about action and adventure, even though Ang Lee did an excellent job of making the action sequences more astonishing than anything I had ever seen before, including the Matrix. It was about the inner turmoil of the man dealing with his past, and the rage and anger that is in all of us. It is that subtle point that should be remembered when judging this movie.

If you didn't see this movie because of these poorly written and considered reviews of the movie, see it when you can on video. If you panned it, see it again and try to see beyond your previous opinion. The movie was good, and you're foolish not to like it.",9.0,3 August 2003
One of the greatest comic book movies of all time!!!,"Ang Lee is a master of film-making! While the movie wasn't perfect, I would have to say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. From acting, to visual effects; from cinemtography to storyline; I found myself wanting to see this movie again only minutes after I saw it for the first time. As a guy, I love watching things get crushed and blown up, but as a film-lover, I need to see story and acting as well. IT'S ALL THERE!!! Hulk is Titanic for guys!",8.0,6 July 2003
Surprisingly phat movie! (Note: Andromeda Strain link?),"The weird, but interesting and elegant sceneshifts, the highly credible scientific details, the underground science labs - no, it doesn't have the exact, indescribably eerie mood of the Andromeda Strain - but the similarities are obvious.

Anyway! I went to this, expecting a lightheaded action treat like ""Charlie's Angels"". In stead: The emotional trauma description, the portrayal of an unstable mind - and the mentioned scientific details; chemical centrifuges, petri dish shots, C code with if-statements and boolean sentences - Ang Lee has gone to the bottom of this film and does his very best to make the insane Hulk-universe credible.

He has gone as far as he could to link the Hulk up to ""our"" reality, and it's good that he has gone to these lengths - because the Hulk himself is not that linked to reality. You remember CG-Gollum from Two Towers, one of the more credible (CG) characters ever seen in a movie? Well, not that kind of CG-character...

Why? The design of CG-Hulk is without a doubt based on cartoon pages - but it doesn't work as it should. For the X-men's ""travel to the silver screen"", their cartoony look was replaced with something more high-tech, to fit into our time, and the movie format. Although I didn't like that with the X-Men, it might've helped The Hulk. Made him more humanly looking, given his anger a better, more credible look - or give him some sort of movie-adapted touch that didn't bring your thoughts towards computer generated graphics..

But! The CG-scenes with the Hulk are the only weak parts of this movie - in my opinion. Anything that surrounds the Hulk, everything that happens around him - bear the fingerprints of a great director. I really love the Hulk's effect on his surroundings - heavy metal items smashing against stuff like toys. Yes, ""Hulk like smash things"" - but the scenes still maintain their artistic integrity.

You can see that Ang Lee is a true filmmaker - he's not only a photographer who makes beautifully composed shots (and he does!), but he thinks in the fourth dimension - time. He makes beautifully composed movements. He uses forces, materials and consistencies against each other in an excellent way. He uses perspective shots which have an excellent movement flow to them.

The fight-scene in the desert is genius.. using the consistency of sand to underline the forces at work and the Hulk's size! Really, really nice! Together with his experimental approach, this is a courageous movie. Ang Lee, great work!

For everyone that can't see the beauty of this movie, or connect to the core of it: Try to look past the Hulk-character. If you can't, well, then I can understand you hated it. Look at the director's work. Absorb the moods. The Daredevil was, in relation, a parody, with a horrible story and hardly any credible characters. Spiderman was flat, predictable, and had the worst bad guy + costume ever seen in a movie. The Hulk thrones easily above these movies. In my opinion.

8/10",9.0,11 July 2003
It ain't for kids!,"Hulk is a great film made by a great director. But Hulk has two huge problems. Firstly, its audience. And secondly, its release date.

Hulk is a very insightful film about the true nature of heroism and also of identity. Its rare to see a film about a super hero that actually deals with one of the most important aspects of heroism- the fact that most super heroes would rather not have the power(s) they possess. Of course the incredible Hulk is not a typical spandex- wearing hero, and in this movie version we see Eric Bana's character struggle with his new identity. However, audiences that have been used to watching such releases as x men, spiderman, and even daredevil, are not tuned to Ang Lee's vision of Hulk. Quite the opposite is true. So the fact that Hulk tries to flesh out its characters and provide enough emotional weight to its scenes is completely irrelevant to a young and action-thirsty audience.

The special fx are awesome. The integration of cg and live action is great, and the hulk himself looks amazing when bullets are rippling on his skin and when he is bounding from place to place.

Sam Elliot plays Betty's father and gives a convincing performance as a general forced to protect his country and his daughter. Jennifer Connelly is perfect as Betty and even Bana manages to stay believable at some of the most unbelievable moments. Its just a shame that Hulk was released at a time when super hero movies are two a penny. Is Ang Lee the only film maker who realises that real comic book fans aren't kids anymore? Has Hulks box office takings doomed us to flimsy scripts and trailer-worthy visuals? Lets hope not, because i don't think i could sit through anymore spiderman films.

So the next time you hear someone telling you how bored they were during Hulk, tell them to go watch Xmen 2...then go watch Hulk with dts- a real hero film with a great story, terrific cast, and beautiful visuals(even when things aren't being blown up!) It ain't for kids!",8.0,25 October 2004
Best Comic to Film translation EVER!,"I really don't see what all the negative buzz is about. This film blew me away with its remarkably unique style, compelling story and amazing effects. It's earned a spot at the TOP of my ""all time best comic book movies"" list!",10.0,23 June 2003
Simply beautiful,"Thats what was going through my head throughout the movie. It was near perfect. The opening sequence couldn't have been any smoother in setting up the story. The story was beautifully told, the CGI was great and never had me thinking, ""Oh men that looks crappy"" like some scenes in Spiderman and that awful fight scene in the Matrix Reloaded.

What I liked about the movie is that it didn't fall in to the typical formula for comic to big screen movies. Build up to the creation of the hero, introduction of a bad guy and then right back to regular action movie. The story was so well blended into the movie that it never felt like the usual squashing a story line in for an excuse for the super hero in action.

The comic book style shots were also well done. The only reason I can see anyone not liking this movie is because Banner hadn't turned into the hulk in the first 15 minutes. But thats exactly the kind of movie I dislike when you forget the plot and are looking for any excuse for super hero action. In the end there is more than enough of Hulk smashing. The last fight scene was a tid bit much but other than that the acting and everything else was well done.

Best marvel movie as far as I am concerned. Gave it a 9 out of 10",9.0,21 June 2003
Great Movie!,"I must admit that when I saw the commercials I thought this was going to be another flashy summer blockbuster movie. When I saw it, boy was I wrong! This movie has an understandable plot, characters were well developed and memorable. I don't like movies that try to be complicated and hard to understand. When I saw the movie, I became more interested as to why each character acted the way they do. The action and computer generated scenes were excellent. Overall, I think this movie will be a success this summer.",8.0,22 June 2003
Very well done,"I didn't have too many preconceptions going into this movie except hoping the story would be good and that the actors would have natural and flowing delivery of decent dialogue. Some of my favorite TV shows and movies of the past had extremely cheap FX (remember Doctor Who) but still kept you glued to the screen seeing what would happen next because of interesting characters and good story. I think this movie delivered very well in all aspects of what I mentioned above and also in some extremely well done action sequences. I was very impressed with the look of the hulk fighting in the bright daylight (perhaps even more so than his night battles). The use of split panels and crossfading scenes was fantastic and really helped the movie flow.

Being an adult I enjoyed the serious setup at the beginning and that the tone stayed throughout. I didn't feel any drastic change in tone when the Hulk first appears and I think they did a great job with Sam Elliot's character by not turning him into a cigar chomping, fascist ""destroy at all costs"" military freak. He comes across as a soldier doing his job to protect the public and a father trying to regain a connection with his daughter. All the characters were very three dimensional.

People can complain and nit pick all day long on CGI details but after seeing huge disappointments like Matrix Reloaded and to a much lesser extent X2, excellent CGI does not a great movie make. Characters and story do. If a steady diet of MTV style editing and Calvin Klein shots of beautiful people has become substance for up and coming movie watchers today it's not a surprise that anytime you have people actually spending time talking to each other in real language as opposed to catch phrases and tag lines, the camera doesn't jolt around through 10 different angles, they're bored and think nothing's happening.

Well done Ang Lee....I hope you don't rush back to small independent character studies anytime soon as you really know how to humanize big action spectacles...

P.S I thought the CGI in the HULK was seriously kick ass anyway (Ok, the dogs looked a little like they were injected with helium, but the energy in that scene rocked)",9.0,24 June 2003
Definitely above most comic book movies,"The first thing that struck me about the Hulk, prior to its beautiful CGI special effects, was its ambition. Ang Lee, in bringing the Incredible Hulk to life, has created a rather original movie. It is impossible not to compare the movie to the comic book itself in its format, as I am sure was intentional. For those unfamiliar with the extremely long-running comic book, Ang Lee's film captures the Hulk in his purest form: pure, unadulterated rage. Without giving away too much of the plot, Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk when he loses control of his anger. Chaos ensues. Now for the details:

The Hulk looks great. Even for those not very enamored with CGI, the amount of emotion portrayed by the Hulk's computer generated face is magnificent. The animation flawlessly blends with reality, and one forgets that there is even a mixture of the two. There are moments in the film where I was struck by the beauty of the setting, particularly in the desert scenes. Watching the monster glide through the air made me think of Crouching Tiger, even though the similarities are minimal. Ang Lee has created art, an original piece of film-making about an old, overdone story.

Now for the rest: the acting is good, if not great. Jennifer Garner is a wonderful actress, and her skills are a bit under-utilized here. The actor playing Banner is good, and conveys the self-anguish inherent in his character well. The plot is very good, often surprising even Marvel enthusiasts.

This film caught a lot of flack for many reasons, but I think that is the result of this film being so over-publicized. Ang Lee has made a film worthy of his talents, and even non-Marvel fans should be able to appreciate this original movie.",8.0,9 May 2004
too self-conscious for its own good,"Everybody rips the CGI, but I thought it looked very good. The bad part of the movie is the first half - we only see Hulk 40 minutes into the film, and before that it's all pretentious talk, talk, talk, building up to an ""I'm your father, Luke"" type of revelation. That movie was out 20 years ago already, we've all seen it, no need to rehash. Likewise, there was not need to pile up melodrama about Fathers and Sons, that book came out a century and a half ago, we've all read the Cliff's notes when we had to pass World Lit in our sophomore year of college, no need to rehash.

Loved the comic-book style transitions. Original, adds intensity.

Too bad there probably won't be a sequel - now that they got the origin story out of the way, the next would have more wall-to-wall action and would mean a better movie.

Less Banner angst! More Hulk smash!",8.0,6 October 2003
An excellent anti-war film laced with Apple computer commercials. We can only hope for sequels!,"Whatever your personal views are about the recent military actions taken by the United States, Hulk makes a strong comment on them, even if only indirectly (and not very indirectly, at that). It's been years since I've seen the original TV show (and I was a kid when I saw it, too), so I don't remember too much about the show beyond the basic appearance of the Hulk in it, which was actually the source of one of my strongest reservations about the new movie. From the previews, I was a little dismayed to see that the Hulk was made so big that he was cartoonish and completely unreal, as though he had been so distorted by modern capabilities of computer effects that his original appeal as the angry side of Bruce Banner was turned into a focus on the technique rather than the result.

Needless to say, Hulk is a film that entails massive amounts of special effects, the majority of them fairly impressive, although they still remove any sense of realism from the movie. While it's true that this results in more focus on the technique throughout the entire film on how it was made rather than the results, it is still highly entertaining and it delivers an extremely valuable message, especially in modern American society.

As we have seen in countless other films (such as great films like E.T., The Iron Giant, etc.), the first response of the military (and, by extension, adults) to something out of the ordinary is to destroy it as potentially dangerous. In this case, as in the case of The Iron Giant, this is exactly what makes everything worse, and in both films, even direct advice and evidence is completely ignored.

As was recently the case with Curious George, our fearless leader, military action is strengthened even when it is seen to be both futile and the fuel of the problem. I love how they attack the Hulk relentlessly even though they are making no progress and simply making everything worse. I love movies that reflect real life, even though they physically resemble it almost not at all.

One of my favorite things about the movie is that it is able to deliver such a strong message while being so campy at many times. The movie is peppered with over-acting and cheesy special effects, but in a movie like this, things like that only add to the entertainment value. I had very low expectations for Hulk, but after having seen it I am anxious to add it to my collection when it is released on DVD.

There are things, for example, that the Hulk is capable of doing that, when done onscreen, are so unexpected and hilarious that they make you laugh out loud, but it is a testament to the meaning of the movie that you can laugh at something like that Hulk running something like 100 mph and then literally leaping into the atmosphere and landing miles and miles away. He is literally able to RUN away from helicopters so fast that, even though they're airborne, they're unable to keep track of him.

Ang Lee's 2003 version of the Hulk is probably 8-10 times the size of a human man, he is capable of grabbing a full-sized military tank by it's gun barrel and swinging and tossing it like a sack of marbles, and he is all but able to defy gravity, but the movie itself is massively entertaining and delivers a great message about the need to understand the adversary before blindly seeking to blow it up.

It is extremely rare for movies these days to be bold enough to make statements like this, and even more rare for these messages to be delivered in such creative and clever packages (Bruce Almighty is also a recent example of a film like this). Lee may have stepped down in seriousness from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but definitely not in quality. I can't say that I would rank Hulk with Crouching Tiger, but it is definitely a movie that contains more than you might expect. Watch it, enjoy it and appreciate it, decipher the message and take it for what you will, try to resist the urge to run out and buy an iMac, and with all the special effects and CGI, can we please get someone from make-up over here to do something about Sam Elliott's mustache??",9.0,9 July 2003
People really hate this movie. I really hate people.,"The Hulk, in the core story, never really was a superhero. The targeted audience, or more, the audience which targeted themselves for this movie, came in for a superhero movie. Is the Hulk really that unloved by the American non-comic reading public that they don't, at the very least, understand that the Hulk has always been a psychological thriller, about one mans inability to deal with emotional strain?

If we were to have received the movie they had been expecting, where we see endless sequences of Hulk smash, we would be left wondering where all the rage was coming from. The Bruce Banner trauma storyline is used to explain why the Hulk can't be controlled, and anybody who watches this movie and fails to grasp that should feel right at home at this summers Catwoman.

The story of the Hulk offers so much to people like myself who aren't exactly emotionally stable. Spider-Man can appeal to everyone, the Hulk is a more personal sort of character to identify with, and even through a few dryly delivered lines, still manages to reach inside of us and make us feel like we know exactly the sort of torment Bruce Banner is going through.

In the end, the Hulk turns out to be a movie for either those most familiar with the comic, or those who would absolutely never read comics. The action sequences and the Hulks rage are all an extension of the drama, not the other way around. And while that may turn off thousands of people who were hoping for an action packed slug fest with no meaning, it distinguishes Hulk from other comic book movies, and will ultimately secure this movie a very loyal following.

It's a damn shame nobody involved wants a sequel, there's so much dramatic potential in Banner attempting to rid himself of the Hulk, and now that all the people who don't need to be watching a Hulk movie won't want to, the sequel would probably wind up a lot more loved by those who do go out to see it.",10.0,27 July 2004
the non-comic-book comic book movie,"The hardest thing about any 'super hero comic book' movie is setting tone. It's finding a way to bring the audience into a world where costumed superpowered being exist and people accept it. DC solves this problem off the bat by setting their stories in fictional places. From the outset the audience is willing to accept the fantastical because we don't have to take that extra step of saying ""there's nothing in New York like Superman""

Marvel has made it more difficult by putting their fantastical characters into real world locations. We all know what New York or San Francisco are like and we all know that superbeings do not roam the streets (despite what the national enquirer might say).

So finding the tome becomes paramount. In Spider-man, the tome was very comic-book-y. Sure it was New York, but the characters, the places, science were all over the top - heightened. We accepted the reality because we are told from the beginning, it's a comic. X-Men went the other direction, playing it as close to real as possible. We are simply told at the beginning that mutants exist but otherwise we are introduced to a New York that is the same as what we know. Daredevil's biggest failing was it's inability to balance 'playing it straight' vs. 'it's a comic book'

Which brings us to the Hulk, probably the most cerebral of the bunch while simultaneously being the most comic-like in look. The first half of the movie is completely Hulk-free and plays out in the confined spaces of laboratories and bedrooms. There is talk of genetic engineering and strained father-child relationships. The relationships between all 4 main characters to each other is laid out wonderfully, each person having a conflict with each of the other 3. If one didn't read the marquee before entering, you could almost be fooled into thinking that this was a drama about the ethical implications of genetic research and the personal lives of the people involved. It's no surprise people wanting to see 'HULK SMASH' are getting bored with the first hour of the film.

The wait is worth it though. When Bruce Banner finally transforms the first time, our anticipation of the event has been raised to such a point that the scene can't possibly fail - we are satisfied simply by seeing the big green guy bust stuff up. The string of action scenes that follow, including a fight with 3 'hulked-out' dogs and later the desert chase are all perfectly staged and the CGI work is seamless and believable. Unlike Spider-man, who too often came across like a rubber ball lacking any weight, Hulk has weight and mass. Even when jumping miles, or deftly outrunning military choppers, the CGI works because Hulk's abilities have been slowly and carefully established. Also, our emotional attachment to Bruce has been developed far more than had we simply been given Hulk in the first 10 minutes. By the time he does transform, we care about how it affects him as a person as well as being wowed by the effects.

There is an odd scene in the final act where Nick Nolte seems to think he's in 2 man stage play and must project to the back row. It's the one moment that feels out of place despite it's necessity to set up the final conflict.

The visual look contrasts the reality of the events. The locations on screen are 'real' We recognize them as 'a lab' 'a family room' 'a cabin' but the editing, both in scene transitions and use of split screen gives even the most dramatic scenes the feel of panels in a comic. It wouldn't have surprised me in the least to see a big hand come across the screen and turn the page to the next scene. For me, this blend of reality and comic book worked wonderfully.

There are flaws of course. General Thunderbolt's motivations and at times his objectives seem unclear and immoral scientist cum businessman Talbot seems more a pesky nuissence than a full-fledged adversary.

No doubt this is a heady film, more along the lines of the first X-Man movie and light years from the video-game fun of Spider-man. Hulk is a comic book action movie for the art house crowd. For some, that's a match made in h-e-double hockey sticks, for others, like myself, the intellectual aspects of the film mirror the intellectual enjoyment we get from reading an intelligent comic.",8.0,23 June 2003
"bold, unique, intense","I debated with myself somewhat on whether or not I wanted to pay to see this in the theater due to the mixed reviews. Now that I have actually watched it, I'm glad I didn't listen to the naysayers. I can see why this is not some people's cup of tea, but I really got into it. It is one of the most interesting moviegoing experiences I've had in some time.

The movie IS somewhat schizophrenic, the first half being broodingly intense and character driven, while the second half focuses more on straight action with even a little bit of humor thrown in. I for one enjoyed both sides of its personality. I think Danny Elfman's musical style, which I sometimes find somewhat annoying as in ""Men in Black"" fit extremely well in ""Hulk"". Ang Lee gets great performances from his lead actors as well. I liked ""Crouching Tiger"" but didn't really see what all the fuss was about. With this film, I can see why he is hailed as a visionary director. The film itself is beautifully shot. Lee's decisions and fingerprints are present and evident in every scene, but the techniques he employs are never overtly intrusive. He obviously experiments somewhat in this film, to good result in my opinion. Love or hate what he does here, but you've got to admit to and admire the vision, determination, and just plain guts it took to make this film the way he did.

As for the green guy, he is hit or miss. In some scenes he feels so real you can almost feel his breath. Others are laughable. For the most part, however, I was able to accept the result and suspend my disbelief. I felt for the big guy, and that's what counts in the end.",8.0,23 June 2003
"A great movie, innovative elements, not for the simple-minded","Hulk was one of the most interesting cinematic experiences of 2003. It was also underrated and IMHO maligned by critics who didn't like the fact that the movie had some intelligence wired in. Truth is, even if the film had pandered to the simplest, stupidest, ""Hulk Smash"" element, it would have been panned as too juvenile. Rather than expecting the character from the early 1970s (e.g., Bill Bixby's alter-ego), think of a classic combination of old Universal monsters (Frankenstein - an inspiration of the character, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, Hunchback of Notre Dame) and throw in some powerfully elemental Oedipal issues, shake well, and enjoy the fireworks. That's what it's all about - and for those open to think about it - it works!

On top of that, the performances were great, especially from Nick Nolte, Sam Elliot, and Jennifer Connelly. I think Eric Bana did a good job as well; face it - he was meant to be the vulnerable, geeky straight-man to the Green Goliath. Not the kind of part the brings the range of Jack Nicholson or Robin Williams to mind.

The effects were truly remarkable. Hulk himself exceeded most expectations. The style and cinematography - split screens, morphing elements transitioning between scenes - were VERY impressive and helped bridge the comic book lore with the live action. Again, not for the ""Bam! Sock!"" crowd. Definitely a comic movie that goes better with wine rather than beer.",9.0,5 June 2005

But then when I saw the film and everything was put into context. I found myself saying ""someone should shoot the guys who 'trailered' this movie"".

Best of the big summer releases of early 2003,"If I were see Hulk, X2, or Matrix Reloaded again, Hulk would be my pick.

While it may not be up to the standard the first X-men or Spiderman set, it still is far better than many of the comic-book wanna-bes like Daredevil.

After all the talk of the long setup, it's sad to find that the setup is the weakest part and not nearly as long. There could easily be another 5 minutes, and it would help. The pace of the movie is more than fast enough despite the length. Anyway, there is at least one little surprise in the beginning that adds a much needed laugh, though the 5 year olds will miss it.

As for the visual FX, wow. As close to human/creature realism as anything before it, with the possible exception of the Two Towers. More realistic in the naturalness of the movements and integration with the real world (buildings, trees, people, water, etc.). Eight Legged Freaks did a good job of it last year with spiders, but you can get away with a lot more with non-human creatures. That and there were still moments of dimensional displacement (in the old huge creature movies, the points where it's obvious the creature and the other objects, be they buildings, people, etc., were not actually together). In Hulk, nothing like that jumped out at me. The Hulk always seemed as if it were actually with the surroundings and people.

Soundtrack fit in well, nothing forced. Nothing distinctly original or groundbreaking, but enjoyable anyway. The sound FX has a realism in it too. Not too big or loud as is often becoming the case in other movies. The surround sound, like every other big movie, is still lacking. That said, there isn't any sound displacement to make it seem faked.

As for the acting, it fit with the overall comic-book, over-stated sort of feel where everything, including personalities, are exagerrated, like 50s-style characters.",9.0,23 June 2003
"Good, but not consistent with the TV series","Ya, I know it's not supposed to be consistent with the TV series... but wanted to make it clear. I never read the comics much, but was a big fan of the TV series growning up.

For fans of the TV series you can consider this as ""Hulk"" on steriods. He's bigger and stronger than ever - in my opinion, to the point of being excessive. But I hear this is consistent with the comic - so not necessarily a bad thing.

If you go into this movie as a fan of the comic or can disassociate it with the TV series - then it's an enjoyable movie. The plot, drama and love story are all decent - in general I would say it's very ""Super Heroic"" with some decent drama thrown in.",8.0,20 June 2003
A new touch to a new genre,"This movie really adds a new touch to a new genre of movies. The comic book style fonts is seen before in Spider-Man, but the comic-book style screen layout is really new and very nice, actually. I actually like the idea of the screen looking like a comic book page with live action scenes in each box. A smart, but inevitable development, I think, in this relatively new genre of movie that is probably going to monopolize summer blockbusters for a long time to come.

I also enjoyed the artistic representations and relations between big and small, the way the universe and a cell are put into a screen and made to seem almost the same, or a desert landscape and fungus on a rock.

All in all, I really enjoyed this movie. If people complain about the CG mindlessly, I'm sorry, but that's really dumb. The Hulk's modelling was very good, but I'll admit from one of the posts in the forums, that they could have textured him better. When I showed my mother a poster of The Hulk, she said it looked like plastic. That is intelligent criticism. Just saying ""The CG sucked"" is dumb. The CG was good. He interacted very nicely with his environment.

I liked the idea of them developing the story properly for almost an hour into the movie before giving us even a whif of the Hulk. I think that does justice to a large movie franchise in dedicating the first part to proper, human development of the character (unlike in Spider-Man; I was somewhat surprised at how fast they introduced the superhero).

And this character development wasn't at the expense of the entertainment either. There was enough ""Hulk Smash"" to keep it entertaining.

The ending was also good. It nicely wrapped up the story in the movie while leaving enough room for a sequel. I'm sorry, but after Lord of the Rings and Matrix Reloaded, movies that end as if they were a whole movie cut into half seriously, SERIOUSLY tick me off, even if that's the point. Even the Spider-Man ending left a lot hanging. It left with Spider-Man all fine and dandy, swinging around. The ending in Hulk is where something actually ends and nothing but a new story can only ever develop.

Casting was really good. The young and old versions all looked like each other. Absolutely seemless. In fact, even their 4-year-old versions were good.

I'll rate it a high 9/10 because 1. it has a good story, 2. it has good action, 3. it was deep for a comic book movie, and Ang Lee didn't mess it up, and 4. the novelty in the comic book-ish feel on-screen.",9.0,10 July 2003
"When you dont know,you should ask...","Welcome to the comic book film genre.

Lets cut to the chase with a name,Ang Lee. I never could have imagined where this man was taking us, but it was a hell of a trip.

This film has roots that reach from ancient Greek tragedy and comedy and the fine line that separates the two and goes as far as the evolution of life.

These things will pass unnoticed and never be acknowledged as the stroke of genius that they really are.Shame.

The on screen mosaic that Ang Lee created rivals the kinetic power of Akira Kurosawa.Extremely well timed action sequences and an amazing performance by Nick Nolte makes this one of the years best, dear I say it,blockbusters.

I am not saying its a masterpiece,but for those who get the point, it will be a source of inspiration.

"An Animated Hulk?? Still, very impressive I must say...","Well, to tell you the truth, I wasn't much looking forward to seeing this movie when I heard about it. I like the idea of the Hulk, but never read comics or followed the storyline with any interest. I did watch the TV show when I was a kid when big Lou Ferrigno played the huld and loved it. When I heard it was being made, but the hulk would be animated, I said to myself ""I am not going to see this animated, therefore very cheesy mockery of a film"". Then I thought after seeing preview after preview that maybe it would at least be worth seeing on the big screen. So I went to see it, with very low expectations. From a comic standpoint, I can't comment b/c I don't care for comics all that much, but from a sheer entertainment standpoint.... WOW! I loved the action sequences, and how powerful they were (I am big on strength, size, and power... and this movie shows them all). It did get quite slow in some spots and the last 15 minutes (minus Nolte's performance at the end) I could have done without. But for 25-30 minuted, the incredible strength that computer generated character had on the screen more than satisfied me. To sum up, if you are into this comic book/stan lee stuff, you might like it or you might not... If you just love sheer power and excitment that isn't nearly as cheesy as you would expect, go see it. You might be suprised!",9.0,5 July 2003

"full of deep emotions, great storyteller","This film is not just another summer action packed, senseless film. This movie shows that a great story can be told, and that can surprise, and be reinvented even if we already know what it is about. THe direction by Ang Lee, rapports a lot of deep very emotive feelings. Using the cinematographic language, he makes the audience feel connected somehow to the stream of emotions, that vary, from love, anguish, anger, pain, desire, that the characters live through the story. Excellent movie. The only thing that I didnt like from studios nowadays is that somehow they are showing audiences a lot of scenes from films, in the trailers on TV, and that spoils a little bit the surprise of warching the special FX first time when going to the theater. Specially in high budget films, like Matrix, and Hulk etc.., please studios a trailer is just a sneak peek, dont spoil the fun. I watched involuntarily so many times the special FX from the Matrix reloaded on TV, that they even bored me when I went to see the film, the studios are maybe so desperate to attract audiences that they ruin the whole movie expirience.",9.0,6 July 2003
"It's introspective, and that's a good thing!!!","There are 2 major reasons to love marvel movies. The action, and the characters. X-men is huge because it's about how these people deal with power, and how power can also be a negative thing. It reminds me of the principle of anne rice novels, where she explores how the idea of living forever might not be that great in the long run. Hulk has this kind of introspection. It builds up the backstory better of the character better than any other filmed comic hero. the lower rating stems from the fact that it is not wall to wall action, but quite frankly the action, when it comes, is great. The final fight seen is jaw dropping as is the lead in to it. In short, this movie is perfect, don't let anybody tell you different.",8.0,17 November 2005
Spiderman vs. Hulk: my vote goes to Hulk,"Spiderman is great but Hulk is greater, even though Tobey is a better actor, and even though Tobey is a better Spiderman than Eric Bana is a hulk.

There is quite a difference between the Spiderman and the Hulk: Spiderman changes once, becomes spiderman, and we don't really see much of what he was before he obtained his powers. We do see how he handles the change, and that's the most exciting thing about the movie: he handles it well, becomes a superhuman while remaining human. Even if he loses the girl till the next sequel, he still gets a kiss.

To become The Hulk takes much more than a spider's bite: The Hulk is a temporary superhuman incarnation, and seemingly does not retain much human from Bruce, it is something different. To Bruce, ""hulking"" is like a dream, it's not Bruce anymore. Kissing the hulk does not even occur to Betty Ross.

What's even more interesting, is that while while Tobey's character *is* The Spiderman, The Hulk and Bruce aren't the same thing. The Hulk is more of Bruce's hidden rage transformed into a green monster, and the monster's relationship with Bruce ain't simple. In one of Bruce's dreams, The Hulk reaches out through a mirror and grabs Bruce in his fist. Such relationship between the human and the sleeping monster within him is another entertaining aspect of the movie, impossible in ""Spiderman"".

Spiderman is about ""with great power, comes great responsibility"", and this concept carries a bit too much moral weight for a Friday night, and resembles something on a junior school's required reading list. ""Listen up kids, if you've got great powers, you better quit fooling around, drinking and having fun, you better be putting these powers to a good use....""

The Hulk on the other hand is about hidden powers and rage darkly shifting within each one of us, dreams that we dream but that never come out, things that happened to us in the past that keep inside and that eat us. The Hulk is what happens when the rage does come out and transforms us into something entirely else. Unlike Spiderman, The Hulk is a discovery of things within us, rather than a doctor's lecture on how to handle a spider's bite.

The Hulk is also about freedom, about breaking out of the tired and boring everyday life's egg shell and taking a flight and doing things you haven't been able to, and it does not come with a slight aftertaste of being lectured to.

Perfect comic book movie,"what i expected of 'the hulk', ang lees somewhat spiritual take on the stan lee legend, was a talky id-driven angst superhero flick. what i found, however, was that Lee (ang) had crafted a movie which carries a technically superb dissection of what a real comic book would be like in film form. Hence split screens, wipes and stylish fades straight out of Marvel #248. Sure i'll admit it is quite a slow starter but the last hour is feckin kick ass entertainment.

a beautiful film that needs to be witnessed,"this is a film that not everyone will enjoy but for me it was a very entertaining film. if you watch this expecting overblown action you will surely be disappointed because director Ang Lee focuses on emotion and story rather than the destruction. each sequence is beautifully crafted with lots of split screens to create a truly comic book feel. Ang Lee uses a lot of imagery and sometimes linger on them a bit too long but this is only a minor complaint.

the pacing of the film is also great because the characters are properly fleshed out making you care for them during the action scenes. this itself is the best point of the film because most Hollywood films seems to just want to incorporate lots of action with out any care for character development whereas this film it is the main purpose.

the first hour contains hardly any action but it only serves to introduces characters the second half concludes the bulk of the action which is really satisfying only the ending be a bit of a let down for it uses a lot of low key lighting.

credit has to be given to the CGI team because for me they have created a truly outstanding Hulk with real facial emotions. they deserve an award for this.

Eric Bana and Jennifer Conelly gives a good performance and a quite convincing but Nick knolts acting seems a bit fake.

hopefully a sequel gets made because this is a truly outstanding film that is on par with x-men and spiderman. now that the characters are developed more action can be incorporated in the 2nd film which hopefully will satisfy those who criticised this.

Excellent Adaptation - Really Adds to Comic Book Mythos,"I am really disappointed by all the negative reviews. As is so often the case it seems to me to be mainly caused by false expectations. I am a big fan of the original comic book and I though this was a wonderful treatment of the story. I imagine the younger audience this was likely to appeal to just didn't have the patience to give the film time for the pay off. But when the action gets going it is very well done. Ang Lee deserves praise for tackling such a fantastic story with so much humanity and attention to detail.

The other positive reviews here have said pretty much all the same things I would so I will spare everyone the repetition. Suffice it to say I thought the film had great action, excellent drama, good script and acting and was very true to the feeling of the original comic book.

The saddest thing is that the kind of negative reaction this film got will just continue to dumb down the industry and make some of the best film makers think twice before they consider trying to tackle fantastic subjects in a serious way.",8.0,12 December 2005

I was lucky to see a midnight viewing of this movie, and my final reaction was...well done, but could have been a bit better.

Now before taking my comments at face value, allow me to elucidate my comments. The first thing we see that makes this movie valuable is the ""24""-like editing of the movie. The movie's feel is like watching a comic book in action...that's smart...very smart. And just like a comic book, we get a prologue of how things lead to the present day. And like a comic book,we get periods of the surreal/dream sequences.

Most fans' biggest concern was whether the CGI Hulk looked real enough. Well, let me put it this way...CGI Hulk is great. Hey, even CGI Gollum looked liked he didn't belong at points, and similarly with the CGI Hulk. And that isn't the fault of anyone...CGI just hasn't evolved to the point that it is totally realistic. But then again, most action scenes in Hollywood films don't look realistic either. Any effect requires a suspension of belief, and CGI Hulk is no different. And trust me, you won't be complaining when you see Hulk bitchslap the ""Hulk-dogs"" or make scrap metal of a whole tank battalion. As a matter of fact, the audience I was in was cheering the Angry Green Giant on.

Which leads me to story. Making any comic book into a movie is a tough task. Take the movie the Hulk will be compared to: Spiderman. Most comics have a pretty good storyline, but when converted to film, they become an arena for showing off CGI can and mindless action. Not to dis' Spiderman, but connection to the character was missing. And that blame goes to the scriptwriter, not the director (David Koepp, who wrote Spiderman, has to be one of the laziest scriptwriters in the business: it's just that the movies that he scripts are ones with great hype). Hulk, on the other hand, is scripted by James Schamus, who gives adequate time to not only the Hulk, but the other characters in the script. He (as well as Ang Lee) take the time to understand the characters and their psyche. As a result, the Hulk doesn't become a ""Hulk Smash!""-fest, but rather a study on repression. Even the Hulk shows signs of intelligence behind the anger that creates him.

Acting couldn't be better. Eric Bana takes the character of Bruce Banner to a new level from Bill Bixby's Banner (which was great to begin with). Jennifer Connelly shines as Betty Ross, and Sam Elliot is perfectly cast as General Ross. However, the best performance in the film goes to Nick Nolte as David Banner. For most actors, David Banner would be an excuse to go over the top, but Nolte does a fine job balancing the role of a loving father and mad scientist.

So where's my complaint? Without giving too much away, it would have to be the climax. If anything, it is more of an anticlimax. After all the torment that Bruce Banner/Hulk go through, a more solid climax should have been achieved. And this is where one may argue ""artistic interpretation"", but the climax, apart from being incomprehensible (both in the physical sound and artistically), looks like it should have been part of a movie called ""Crouching Hulk, Hidden Banner"". It came off as too abstract for even a solid drama. Plus, being set in the dark doesn't help convey the point.

On the whole, definitely a must-see. Definitely more intelligent than the pseudo-philosophy given in Matrix Reloaded. However, don't expect too much out of the climax. 8/10",8.0,20 June 2003
Marvel has done it again.,"If you are into comic books, especially Marvel's great characters, you will love this film. Ang Lee does a great job bringing the HULK to the big screen. Great storyline, great SFX, and great presentation. Only complaint, a little too long.

To the bashers, don't worry Batman 14, starring Screech from Saved by the Bell, will be out next month.

Nolte steals the show!,"I've never been a huge fan of Nick Nolte, but when I heard he was cast in this movie I was generally happy because every good comic movie needs a character actor in it (i.e.: Walken in 'Batman Returns'). I wasn't expecting to see any fabulous acting in this (aside from Academy Award winning Connelly), and was completely surprised at Nolte's passionate performance.

Usually in Super-Hero movies, the villain is just some crazy mofo who kills for fun (i.e.: Nicholson in 'Batman', Farrel in 'Daredevil'), but Nolte's David Banner is a reluctant villain. He created his 'freakish' son, Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) and has wanted to finish him off since Bruce's childhood, but his 'curiosity' restrained him.

When Nolte's David and Bana's Bruce clash at the end, I was entertained to the fullest. Aside from Nolte's fabulous performance, there are a few flaws. The CGI Hulk looks fake sometimes, but mostly good. I'm surprised at the emotion CGI characters are expressing these days, with this film's Hulk and Lord of the Ring's Gollum.

The fight scenes are done well too, though Director Ang Lee's fancy way of editing gets a little hard to watch, but still good.

Great comic book movie, overall I give it an 8 out 10.",10.0,21 June 2003
Best Film of the Year.,"Let me start off by saying, who ever posted the review that gives this film one star obviously didn't see the right movie, or they simply wouldn't know a good film if it punched them in the face. This film works on so many levels that it puts even the awesome X-2 to shame. First off the plot and the character development are so incredible and intense that you totally forget that you are watching a comic book adaptation. The tale is brilliantly told and the acting from all is top notch, Nick Nolte's character literally gave me chills. Now as for all of you wonder if the CGI was good, or if it was bad? Trust me it was top notch, and definitely better than any one could have imagined, I can definitely see this as setting a new benchmark for digital characters. You feel the anger and sadness and everything in between that the Hulk is going through, as he has to not only survive torment by the army, but also uncover the painful secrets of his past, face the sins of his long lost father and find his humanity in his love for Betty. Yes, it is that deep and complex. Another thing that deserve mentioning is the masterful direction of Ang Lee and the unique was he filmed the movie in a split screen/comic panel style (think of Fox's show '24'), which allows for a much more intense and personal experience. Also lending to the overall product if Danny Elfman's soundtrack, which is without a doubt his best to date and is very surprising. It incorporates a lot of tribal sounding elements (ala Gladiator) that really lend to the dark and dramatic tone of the movie. So basically, if great acting, superb drama and some of the best special effects I have ever seen are not enough to make you enjoy the film than I guess you just don't have a pulse. To me this IS the definitive comic book film. It does not water down the drama to sell it to little children like Spiderman did, nor does it try to infuse darkness and violence just because it would be cool (see, Daredevil). You see, while I like all of the above-mentioned films none of them really can prepare you for the real, dramatic and believable darkness of this film. The closest thing I can compare it to, even though comparing it doesn't really due it justice, would be X-2, if you took the atmosphere of that film and cranked up everything to eleven, the action, the drama, and most of all the sense of darkness and dread that is there without being over powering, that would be the closest analogy I could come up with. I think people will be surprised and very divided on this movie. They will either love it or hate it, and it is definitely not for the kiddies (not so much for violence, but just for the overall intensity and atmosphere of the film). Lastly, while I am sure a lot of die hard fan boys will balk at the dramatic change to the Hulk's origin, In terms of feeling and raw emotional power, this is a more faithful adaptation than I should have ever hoped for. In my opinion, this is not just the best film of the summer; it is the best film that has been releases so far this year. I HIGHLY recommend that everyone go and see this film. *10 out of 10 stars*",10.0,9 June 2003

The Hulk smashes the other comic heros into the ground!,"The critics praised the movie, yet the ratings were not as favorable on IMDB. This left me tentative to see the film, but I went anyway. The Hulk far exceeded all expectations I had for the film. The character development was superb, the animation was breathtaking, Ang Lee once again proves his ability as a director. This movie had a full story, believable and empathetic characters, fantastic acting, and of course, great animation. I certainly hope a sequel is created, and I will be the first in line to see it!",10.0,24 June 2003
Whats so bad about this film? I like It!,"Come on. This was a good film! You can't expect a fantastic Action flick from a arthouse director such as Ang Lee. And unless you have read the comic, won't have a full idea from the angle of which the movie is coming from. I was expecting a fantastic action movie before i saw it. When, at first i saw it, i was disapointed. I still don't like the flash backs. But when i went away, the more i thought about it, the more i liked it. I realised that i hadn't got a fantastic action movie, but what i had got was a lot more. It was on one level, a great action movie. The bits of action in it where superbly done, with the beutiful scences where the Hulk Was jumping across the land. Then you have a great script, with solid dialouge, that carried the story well. You also had great acting from Nick Nohlt, and good acting from the rest of the cast. It may have been slightly slow to start, but it needed that to explain Bruce Banners situation. And the film delt fantastically on how you hard it is to deal with Anger, and how not to combat it. It also delt with Bruce's dads struggle with life. How he was obsessed with his son, yet could not propaly love him, the way he felt upstaged by his son. All this was fantastic and i thought it was a triumph for Ang Lee.

Awesome & misunderstood movie... much like it's main character,"Yeah, it's long on emotional drama. So what? Maybe you prefer the fantastic emptiness of the later Batman flicks. Yeah the CGI looks suspect in a couple of places, but it's never bad enough to make you have to fully suspend your disbelief in order to just continue watching the movie. It's more plausible that we have all just become special effects snobs in todays world of ever escalating new effects wizadry.

Hulk is imaginitive, thoughtful, beautiful, entertaining and stylish. Not sure what the detractors were quite expecting, but I can't see that any other approach than the one Ang Lee and his crew took would have worked as well. Beats Spiderman. Nearly on par with X2, but for different reasons.

Excellent and Misunderstood.,"First of all when I sat down to watch this film I was definately expecting it to be nothing more than an intellectually-devoid piece of summer crap.I was so wrong by the time this film ended, what I witnessed was a beautifully filmed and told drama story.It was obvious that director Ang Lee intended for this to be a real movie as the scenes are mature, compelling and sometimes dark.This film was not very well received by many 'critics' and movie-goers alike, I guess they expected it to be like many other overrated and highly regarded garbage like Spider-Man, LOTR etc.Once again this truly excellent movie shows you that it doesnt take a cast of pretty-boy actors, cgi overkill or countless lines of braindead humor to make a very pure and exciting film.This is intelligent cinema with a very talented and visionary director and a cast that all boasts unique and superb performances.Better not turn your brain off for this one.",10.0,3 September 2003
A masterpiece!!!!,"I've never seen such approach on a comic character before, this is truly one wonderful movie. Great acting, good special effects and a story that actually has something in it. Its an artistic movie not minded for everyone out there.

When I first saw this movie I was blown away, yeah I must also say a little disappointed because there was the need to see Hulk destroy things, then I watched it again and again, and even today I saw this movie again, it doesn't lack anything, it's freaking great.

I recommend this movie to everyone that is looking from a movie more then just pure action! Eric Ban and mister Nick Nolte were absolutely great.

What a movie....,"I was very happy with the movie.

I heard that Ang Lee does not comic books, but the way he subliminally had the split screens, transitions, and multishots was awesome, definitely a homage to comics. I've seen movies overdue that way too much, but you can count the number of comic style transitions on one hand. My only complaint was the ending with the father should have been made extended, it would have given the hulk more of a climax ending. I'll definitely have to look for the extended version on DVD.

I shudder at the perfection.,"When I had heard about the famed ""HULK"" returning to the silver-screen I had my doubts, because MARVEL had a good run with the movies it had released earlier in the year, and the year before. So, I had assumed that HULK would be the downfall. I never had a real respect for the HULK because, it sounded like a dull idea to me, but I promised myself I would never judge a movie without doing my homework. So I went and read the comics. Incredible, is all I can say. HULK was perpetuated, with the exception of a few events, so wonderfully that I could do nothing but look at the screen and clap blindly. The movie was fluid, one event leading into the next, no jumping, or plot gaps. Everything is given to you, then all you have to do is sit back and enjoy. Instead of basing a movie solely on it's FX, or Acting, HULK brought both aspects expertly to the screen. I can safely say, that this is by far my favorite MARVEL movie to date. Ang Lee has really outdone his-self this time and I hope his movies will be equally good in the future. I guarantee that anyone, from the hardcore comic book reader to the average action seeker, will thoroughly enjoy this film. And hopefully, they will gain from it the same satisfaction that I have. HULK does not let down. Any nay-say for this movie would most likely come from someone that hates action movies completely, and/or bases these movies entirely on the comics that precede them.

5/5 Stars.",10.0,20 June 2003
An intelligent action movie,"For those of you who have been disappointed by formula blockbusters like Spiderman and Daredevil you will be glad to hear that Ang Lee has finally gotten it right. Hulk is not your typical summer action movie where the action drives the movie. Instead it's a beautiful, well-paced movie with complex characters and an interesting story that just happens to have a lot of action. I know it sounds strange that a movie called Hulk could be all this, but in the director's hands the `monster' has been elevated to a classic status, more like Frankenstein than a comic book character. If you are familiar with Ang Lee and have seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon then you know what to expect and won't be disappointed.",8.0,26 June 2003
"Ah, so that's what they call character detail...","Finally, after the recent action/Marvel comic book transfers we have a film, not driven by the words summer cash in and wants to tell a story about people.

Not since the days of being shown the messed up minds of the Joker and Mr Wayne, have we really been given the opportunity to see what makes Characters inject themselves with jellyfish antibodies and starfish gunk...

The Hulk uses a substantial amount of the viewing time given the background to the creation the character, without loosing the focus on the storyline or in fact cutting back on the action, and this is the next thing that really sticks out from the film. The cost of feeding someone that much and painting them green was obviously going to be too much of a cost so CG has taken over to provide a character that is not over the top in either actions, size, ability and most importantly interaction with surroundings, making it believable that a 20 or so foot green hulk in running around the Nevada deserts.

Photography has obviously been thought about as well, as the greeness of the hulk stands out on the bleak surroundings of the desert and the metallic finish and concrete gray of the military institutes.

Ang Lee has made sure that the film does have enough substance to make it enjoyable to watch and really get into and still leaving in some action to make you smile.

"in depth story, excellent treatment","Excellent choice of direction, this movie is not just another summer lame stupid actioner, like Lara Croft Tomb Raider for example or Charlies Angels, of course I also love to see lame stupid action movies. My point is only, that this movie is intelligent and goes deep in emotions and to the origins of the characters, specially the misunderstood heroe Hulk. Most of the action we had already seen in the trailers on TV, the important thing is the drama treatment, the action just completes the excellent film. If you just want to enter the theater and see action, and you dont want to use your brain at all, then go see another movie. If you want an excellent film, with action and a superb story, then go see the Hulk. Just a masterful adaptation!!",9.0,2 July 2003
This comic book geek loved it!,"I finally saw The Hulk yesterday and was expecting nothing. I had seen the trailers and commercials and thought it was pretty lame looking, but after reading a favorable review on Aint It Cool News, and after realizing that I am such an old school comic geek that I couldn't stay away from a comic book film, I acquiesed.

And I LOVED it. I loved the tragedy, I thought the CGI was a helluva lot better than I thought it was going to be, and I loved the cartoonish way it was directed. My friend and I talked about it in the theater parking lot afterward, and I was saying how I respect the work of Ang Lee so much that I was concerned when I heard that he was going to take on The Hulk... BUT, I knew if anything, he would bring some interesting elements to the story. And he did. For anyone who read the comic book, the story IS a tragic one and not solely all ""Hulk Smash!"" (But I'll admit, I did growl ""Hulk Smash"" on a few occasions and longed to buy the Hulk Hands from the Target across the street from the multiplex afterward.

As far as the acting goes, I've learned to never expect good acting in action films, much less good acting in films based on comic books or graphic novels because they are cartoonish in nature. Off the top of my head, I can only think of a couple of exceptions to the rule: Jack Nicholson as the Joker and Thora Birch as Enid and Steve Buscemi as Seymour in Ghost World. Therefore, I took no issue with the bland acting - although a friend of mine mentioned that Eric Bana's physical transformation into Corey Feldman was frightening.

Acting-wise however, he played the part like he was supposed to. Bruce Banner is bland, well, cuz otherwise we get into that whole Hulk Smash area again. Unfortunately, I can never forgive Jennifer Connelly for, well, being Jennifer Connelly. She's horrid, and her Oscar win is in the same best supporting actress vein as Marisa Tomei, Mira Sorvino and Kim Basinger. I also cannot watch a movie featuring this woman without picturing her in the last 10 minutes of Requiem for a Dream so I always have that stigma to contend with.

In short, I really did like The Hulk. I thought it was visually interesting and appropriately dramatic.

underappreciated,"I watched the movie last night, and was surprised to see the lack of enthusiasm for the movie here. The Hulk features some good to excellent acting, beautiful visual pictures, and very innovative editing. Perhaps the more impatient would find some parts slow, but I found the focus on character, with patience in developing sympathy for them to be appropriate, and refreshing. This is not the mainstream action movie that people were expecting, and I think that that may be part of the reson for some of the negativity.

The bravest movie of the year (thus far),"Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" is the bravest movie I've seen this year, if only in concept. It's the world's first character-driven, art-house inspired comic book adaptation that cares more about the psychological complexities of its characters than it does on its slam-bang special FX. Logical questions immediately pop up, such as ""Do we really need a SERIOUS comic book film?"" Well, probably not, but still, the idea is intriguing, and leave it to Ang Lee to make it somehow work. ""The Hulk"" is the ""Natural Born Killers"" of superhero movies; some absolutely love it, others dispise every bit of it. I'm in the limited crowd of its admirers; I thought it was brilliant in almost every way, from the acting, writing, directing, and musical standpoints (Danny Elfman's score is utterly incredibly). The movie reminded me much of last year's ""Minority Report"" in the way it sort of looks like a popcorn action movie but sort of rises above it; sort of a perfection. ""The Hulk"" is not the greatest comic book ever made (""X2"" deserves that honor) but it is a maginificent film experience. You'll never see anything like it. Although Eric Bana plays Bruce Banner, the poor soul cursed with an inner green monster, the real star of the movie is Lee's inventive direction, which involves everything from ultra-cool split screen ""panels"" to bizarre, head-scratching close-ups on fungi. Lee is obviously having a wild time directing his little ""big"" movie, and brings the same sort of thoughtfulness and power that he brought to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" While ""Hulk"" is not where near as amazing as that film, it is quite a movie. Nick Nolte has to be seen to believed as the crazed father and the special FX range from amazing (the evil killer Hulk dogs) to mediocre (the Hulk jumping). Despite an awkward, out-of-place final scene that cries out for an ineviatable sequel, ""Hulk"" proves to be a successful non-conventional attempt at a conventional subject matter. Overall, I recommend this movie just for you to argue about it with someone. **** out of ****",8.0,3 July 2003

Misunderstood,,9.0,25 January 2005
This is a moving comic book.,"I must apologize first for being an avid comic book fan. My first two comics were Detective Comics featuring Batman and The Incredible Hulk. Two characters that act on their childhood tramas. While Tim Burton's film was a masterpiece of psycological imagery, dark mood and campy exchanges, Ang Lee (sounds like angry) visually creates a comic book tale that feels like high drama.

The themes of repressed memories, the Hulk and Banner always as one, Betty as his blessing and his curse, and the unwillingness to know what lies beneath are all dramatic themes, that belong in the story. The struggle between Bruce and the Hulk is the ultimate theme of the comics and hopefully this series of films.

Eric Bana seems to have a grasp on Bruce. He is emotionless without being cold. Jennifer Connally was dead on for Betty, I was a bit afraid of that casting choice. The fact that Bruce is passionless around Betty, yet Hulk shows tenderness and compassion. So who is the real monster Hulk or Bruce?

The sins of the fathers will be the sins of their spawn. Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte are amazing in their roles. The twist on David Banner was quite a nice spin (yes all the sticklers will hate it). Nolte's performance belongs up there with Willem Defoe as Green Goblin or Danny Deveto in Batman Returns, he walked the fine line of high drama and comic book overkill and nailed. Sam Elliot plays Thunderbolt Ross just like he needs to play him, single-mined to a perfection.

The plot and script, like any sci-fi movie, move fast when doing science stuff and slow down for the human side. I think the modernization of the plot is fine, and the fact that it pays homage to the original is a lovely bonus.

But what about the Hulk? He looked great, moved great and kicked much butt. The desert scenes were amazing, ahem, incredible. The action sequences were well played and brought the same joy as if I were standing out side the comics shop reading a fresh issue.

In the theater where I was at, I just kept hearing the little kids say when does he turn into the hulk, and I'd hear them breathe in really hard whenever Bruce would get angry, and those weren't the times he would turn into the hulk yet.

So there. Loved the Greek tragedy storyline (children punished by the sins of their fathers), loved the acting (especially Jennifer Connelly), adored the editing (the closest watching a film has been to reading a comic, not just the split screen but the closeups, significant lack of panning or tracking shots, etc), loved the fact that there was so little action for most of the movie, was amazed and constantly surprised by the action when it came (heh! Hulk falls from the stratosphere and Ang cuts to a brief metaphysical interlude! oh yes!)... OK, yes, I am justifying why I loved it.

"GREAT movie: smart, daring, fun, and faithful to the comic","Because the hero of the Hulk is an emotionally detached young man it took me a while to learn to care enough about him as a character to become invested in his fate and - by extension - to get into this movie. But once the plot of the film began to unfold, and the major father figures played by Sam Elliott and Nick Nolte got into the action, the movie really started to rock.

The action sequences are tremendous and the acting is very strong. Ang Lee's directing is intriguing as well ... and I particularly love the way he evokes comic-book-panel imagery in his shots. The film has a very inventive visual style that is as impressive, or more so, than the Hulk himself. And I did find the Hulk creature great fun to watch, whether he is having a touching moment with Betty or he's fighting tanks or he's part of a horrific dream sequence. Good stuff. Actually, it has been a while since there has been a cool, ""misunderstood"" monster film, and I felt an appreciation for this movie even as I was reminded of classic films like King Kong and Frankenstein.

While faithful to the comic book, this film is actually superior to its source material in that the characters are more realistic and more complex - especially Bruce Banner's father, who has a truly fascinating background and motivation. And it is harder than it looks doing a good job bringing a comic book to life on screen. Just look at the Batman films, which are all seriously flawed. Certainly the movie critic I respect most, Roger Ebert, has yet to really be wowed by any super hero film since Superman 2, and I can understand why ... they sometimes seem bi-polar when they shift from live-action actor to CGI when Eric turns into HULK and Tobey turns into SPIDEY. And a lot of these movies do recycle origin stories and villains like nobody's business. (ie: the endless Joker rehashes.)

You know... it is a very difficult thing trying to come up with an objective way of judging the quality of the super hero movies that have been coming out the past few years, because everyone has a different level of expectation about how realistic the film should be, how fun it should be, how literate the script should be, how faithful it should be to its source comic or tv show, how many punk-rock characters should be included, and how many nuclear countdowns and car chases should be involved. And I bet it is even more difficult for the directors and producers and scriptwriters to decide how they will balance dramatic considerations ... and to do justice to the acting talents of the A-list casts that are being assembled for what was once considered B-movie material ... with the requisite number of action scenes meant to please audiences hoping to be wowed by the latest advances in CGI technology.

Although this balancing act is hard to pull off successfully, I was delighted with the Spider-Man film because I feel that the movie managed to strike the balance quite nicely. In that film, the comic character that I love best was realized wonderfully by Tobey when in his civilian mode ... and he had great fight scenes with the Goblin when he was in costume. I didn't like X2 because I felt that the characters got left behind by one glitzy special effect after another, so I found it to be a very boring and numbing film ... while the more character-driven X-Men (1.5) was a more exciting movie to me because the characters were more real and the actors were given the chance to emote before the camera cut away to the next effects sequence. And I thought that Daredevil needed a lot MORE action, as well as more character devlopment of Fisk and Urich, and an ending that made more sense. But Hulk, like Spider-Man, gets the mix right. After an admittedly slow first twenty minutes you get great acting AND great action. Intelligence AND spectacle. Great stuff.

And the scene from the trailer when the Hulk beats the crap out of the tanks is hilarious fun.",10.0,23 June 2003
what's with all the bad reviews today?,"Looking at alot of the reviews this morning I wonder if I saw the same movie. Many reviews cry about it being lumbering and boring.

This certainly not Spiderman. It is not a loose and joyful film. It is a thinking man's film for lack of a better term that tries to give some emotional weight to what's going on.

It's funny that by the end of the Batman movie franchise's run everyone (including comic book fans) cried about how ridiculous it had all become. All flash no substance. No reason to care about the characters and plotlines that have no purpose but to set up the next big budget action sequence.

Now if you dare to try to put some substance into a comic book movie people cry that it's boring.

I appreciated the Hulk for trying to be a legit unique movie and thought it suceeded in making me care about the monster and a character I had little interest in going into the theatre (even as a comic book fan). I liked it alot more than I expected to. I just wish it ended 15 minutes earlier than it did because the final action sequence was hard to follow and existed to tie up a loose plot end that could have waited until the inevitable sequel.",8.0,20 June 2003

"""The Hulk"" deserves more credit than it gets!","As for all good movies, you simply can't expect to be a passive viewer. The argument is even stronger when you watch a film by one of the few extremely creative and intelligent directors of our time, Ang Lee. You have to work to watch his films. If you meet him half way, then you realize how rewarding the experience is. If you want to be a lazy audience, then you'll complain that ""The Hulk"" is too tedious to watch. Then don't watch it. But PLEASE do not go around saying that it is a bad film. Just say that you aren't up for it. Be fair.

So far, I have read over and over again that Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" is a very confused film. It may be a 'confusing' film (there is nothing wrong with challenging convention a bit) but it is certainly not a 'confused' film. As a matter of fact, I find it an extremely cleverly made movie. Lee has managed to take a comic book character (one of the darkest ones, too), extract the tormented essence of the Hulk's character and infuse the entire movie with it. ""The Hulk"" does not depict a realm in which everything is either black or white, good or evil, it is precisely situated in that twisted, dark domain of the inner recesses of our minds. That may scare you. It may not be comfortable. But please don't shoot the clever fellow who tries to bring it to life on the screen! He's a brave soul. Don't judge it on the usual Hollywood dazzle scale and turn away because the film wasn't 'pretty' enough or because you didn't get enough laughs out of it.

The naysayers seem to forget that this film is based on a comic book. They criticize that the Hulk looks stupid, like some big ""Gumby on steroids."" Why, because he is big and green? Well, that's the way the Hulk looks, if you don't like it don't go see the film. It's not as if the character was created out of thin air just for this film. I even remember reading a certain critic's article in a highly reputable newspaper making fun of the unbelievable pseudo-science on which the story was based. Well, it is based on a c-o-m-i-c book, no one said this was based on medical research to be published in JAMA anytime soon. Get over it. If you have no better criticisms than that, well, you are obviously trying hard to dislike it. People criticize the CGI, because they feel it looks fake. Well, film is a constructed realm to begin with. And honestly, does anyone know how a 'realistic' Hulk is supposed to look? Isn't that a contradiction of ideas? I think the CGI work in The Hulk was the perfect fit. It had enough 'unrealistic' edges to add to the comic book feel that the entire film was working so hard to capture.

All in all, ""The Hulk"" is a good film. It may not be easy to watch. There may be moments when you're not too sure what to think. However, it is definitely worth the ride. Keep an open mind, sit back and just enjoy the show, will you???",9.0,22 June 2003
You'll actually like him when he's angry.,"When I first heard they were doing a live action version of The Hulk, I wasn't all that excited. I'd never really even liked the Hulk and didn't know much about him, mostly staying staying with more popular characters such as Batman and Spider-man. But after seeing the movie I have to say, this is a good movie for anyone, whether they be an avid Hulk fan or someone who's never even heard of it and just wandered into the wrong theater. The movie stays true to the comics (mostly) and the movie is actually done like a comic with a unique form of editing. Eric Bana is great as Bruce Banner, though when he changes into the Hulk (and CGI takes over) you can't even tell it's the same person. Jennifer Connelly is also good as Betty Ross, but Nick Nolte does a great job as David Banner, Bruce's father, delivering a...somewhat long speech, and adding humor by making fun of one of Bruce's ""tantrums."" Also, the cameo by Stan Lee (creater of The Hulk) and Lou Ferrigno (played the Hulk on the original TV series) is great. All in all, this is a fun movie that stays true to the comics and gives everyone something to relate to (the anger we bottle up, you know you do.)",8.0,20 June 2003
"Flawed, but still highly enjoyable","I didn't expect much from Ang Lee's interpretation of The Hulk mythology. I've never seen his previous movie, Sitting Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or whatever it was called. People say it was excellent, but I've never been remotely interested in seeing it. Regardless though, I went into The Hulk with the lowest of expectations, already tainted by the fact that Hulk would be completely CGI. Was I surprised? You bet. I enjoyed this movie immensely. Were there problems with the script? Sure, it's a superhero movie, there are always holes big enough to drive a Mac truck through in superhero movies. XMen, Superman, Spiderman, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, all had plot holes, all had issues which you can sit and nitpick all day and still not resolve them to everyone's satisfaction. Did this lessen my enjoyment of The Hulk? Absolutely not. People have complained that the first half of the movie is filled with boring, unnecessary setup before you get to see The Hulk for any real amount of time. I say these people need to go back and watch the series with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, and even read the original Hulk comics. The Hulk mythology is about Bruce Banner's struggle to separate his own life from The Hulk. It's about how his mutation affects his relationships with the people around him. There's a scene in the movie, which is shown in the previews, where Banner has a dream and is looking in the mirror and sees The Hulk, and The Hulk reaches through the mirror and kill him. That pretty much sums up the world he lives in, where he is constantly being pulled between being a normal, civilized human being that goes to a job, comes home, and does things that regular people do, or becoming a raging green monster that destroys everything it touches and has little regard for anything except its own core fury. This movie touched on that perfectly, and while I think Eric Banya may not have been the best choice for the Bruce Banner character, I think he did a more than acceptable job as far as stepping into the shoes of Banner for the first time. I eagerly look forward to a sequel, and hope that Lee is once again at the helm of this exciting, dangerous world of The Hulk.",8.0,27 August 2003
great character development,"Being a Marvel comic collector for over thirty years and owning every Hulk comic except for the original six issues, I was skeptical about this movie. I was very pleasantly surprised at Ange Lee's adaptation. The lead in was great, a must for character development. Many action adventures are just action no substance. The Hulk developed its characters which made the viewer actually care what happens to them. The changes in story line which are always unpleasant to older Hulk readers were carried out smoothly. Over all I would rate this 7.9/10.",8.0,21 June 2003
Better than I expected.,"I must say, it was better than I expected it would be. The special effects were wonderful, and as far as I could tell it was a pretty accurate portrayal of his abilities. If you haven't seen it, let me give you fair warning that they do take some liberties with the storyline -- but what they came up with was nonetheless plausible. I especially liked that it didn't get boring -- it was fast-paced, and they did an interesing comic-book styling as far as scene switching and framework. All in all, quality entertainment. :-D",8.0,28 November 2003

A Great Movie... one of the Best of 2003...,"...in spite of all the unadulterated hate for it.

This is really a fantastic film. Ang Lee takes the great source material and constructs an almost Shakespearean tragedy. Yes, it was slow-moving. Yes, the ending was a little bit too dark. But I loved it.

Disappointing for all those who came in expecting a big green man smashing stuff for 2+ hours... surprisingly great for those who came in for a dark, adult drama.

A defense of HULK...,,8.0,17 November 2004
"Freud, yes, but great action too","Many have said that ""Hulk"" is about the torment within Bruce Banner, an emotionally-distant research scientist who has repressed gruesome childhood memories, that once remembered after a near lethal dose of gamma radiation, triggers a transformation that lets loose a personification of ""rage, fear, and freedom,"" namely, the Hulk. They say the Freudian subplot of the interaction between Banner and his father comes to the surface and dominates the movie. Make no mistake, this is all in there. But those who say this are missing the point. This film is about action with a capital A.

You will not be let down if you're looking for action. Many might be overwhelmed by the plot, but the action delivers too. From mutant dogs to million-dollar military vehicles as toys, this movie is action-packed. This is what I look for when I see a Marvel comic-based movie, and this one ranks right up there with Spider-Man. I'm giving this one 8 out of 10.",8.0,25 June 2003
Best FILM that happens to be based on a comicbook,"Ang Lee has done it again. He's a taken a very distinctive genre and recreated it in his own way while keeping the enduring and beloved essence intact. HULK is not the best superhero movie ever. That title belongs to X2. But that's because HULK is NOT a superhero movie. This is a greek tragedy/intense psychodrama/adrenalin-rush all rolled into one. This is the first comicbook movie that, when it shows us psychological drama or emotional trauma, it's serious and heavy without being cliched or pretentious. Ang Lee uses symbolism, metaphors, and allusions to connect the themes of repression, identity, and consciousness. The use of comicbook-like-panels editing is amazing and is going to be very distinctive of HULK from now on. The acting by all parties is exemplary especially the title character himself, the Hulk, who looks amazing and somehow totally believable.

Now that I've mentioned all the bits about the psychological and dramatic depth of the movie, you might be saying, well, it's a Hulk movie! How about some HULK SMASH! Well, when the Hulk shows up, you get everything you could possibly want from a Hulk movie. What I really loved about the movie was Hulk's fighting style. This is what the strongest creature that ever walked the planet would fight like! Raw, messy, and brutal. Anything he can grab, he can break. Most action movies go for a sanitized fight choreography ala Matrix Reloaded which was pretty much punch-kick-block-jump-REPEAT in every single fight. X2 had Wolverine/Deathstrike which was bloodier but still pretty theatrical. However, Hulk fighting was anything but pretty. Heck, at times it seemed like the movie should have gotten an R-rating and that's only because we associate cheesy martial arts with fighting nowadays when it comes to action movies. The Hulk taking on the military was also awesome. Did not look choreographed or monotonous at all.

The Hulk also had very realistic way of behaving when it came to approaching his enemies and what not. The attitude and savagery was displayed not only in his actions but also in his movements, his facial expressions, and the way he carried himself. Great stuff!",10.0,22 June 2003
Best treatment of a Marvel Comic yet,"Marvel has been doing a lot in the movies lately, and doing a great job. Spider-man, Daredevil, and X-men have become great movies, but the real gem in the Marvel Motion Picture crown is the Hulk. This movie really captures the spirit of a comic book. The cinematography is astounding. This film provides evidence of how great a director Ang Lee is.",9.0,16 August 2003
Amazing,"Ang Lee's Hulk is a brilliant work of art. He balances perfectly the action and the drama, and never lets your brain turn off. His groundbreaking wipes, transitions, and other things I don't even have words for yet, will certainly be copied by lesser films. This film will stand the test of time, and will be up there in the greats.",9.0,19 June 2003
"Suspenseful, Thoughtful and above all, Smashing!","Remembering the debacle of the Schumacher Batman and Robin, it is wonderful to see that the superhero film genre has come a long way.

Ang Lee has taken one of Marvel's most iconic character and successfully made the best kind of cross between the action of Spider-Man and the sheer intelligence of Unbreakable with the faithfulness to the spirit of the comic as the X-Men series.

Ang Lee made the perfect choice with Eric Bana with his haunted nature darkening even his happy moments with what lies just below his surface. Jennifer Connelly is ideal as Betty Ross, the steadfast love shows such courage and commitment for her love who carries such a bizarrely dangerous curse. Nick Nolte is the perfect villian, expanding on the original comic idea of Bruce's abused childhood and wow, Sam Elliot is the perfect actor for General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross!

People complain about the dialouge, but for me, the enhanced the film wtih the resulting suspense, first for the gamma rad accident that would curse Bruce and after waiting to see if the next minute will be the one that pushes him over the edge and unleashes the Hulk. The suspense is so strong, it is a relief for the change to occur. Once it happens, the Hulk is incredibly expressive with only his face! He is a child cut off from the rest of the world and can barely understand it as it is, especially with the baddies he has to smash.

Speaking about the smashing, each Hulk sequence is wonderful. The 1st time is heartrending as the Hulk wrecks the lab and Bruce's life's work in an analogy of his life. By the far the best is Hulk's battle with Ross' forces in the most classic kind with Ross throwing everything he has to stop the creature while Hulk gives as good as he gets.

And for all the mayhem, nothing is more traumatic to Banner than the recovery of his painful past which contributed to his difficult present and facing the horrible man who caused it. That is the heart of this drama and the film is better for it.

True, it could be cut for time, but on the whole, a wonderful film about a man who we like when he's angry.

true to the spirit of comic books,"Ang Lee shows why he is one of the best visionary directors in the world today. ""HULK"" is perfectly cast, ingeniously and innovatively directed, and uniquely possesses a perfect blend between story and special effects. The special effects are so good that the Hulk actually looks real. It is a fantastic film with great performances from the lead actors. What I really liked the most about this film was that it reflected the in-depth story-telling of comic books in its golden period of the 80s and 90s. None of this elementary superhero story-telling between good and evil generally directed to wider viewing audiences. Because this is not a film for the kids. Instead we see more darker themes which are more apparent in the actual comic books. It is abundantly clear that Ang Lee has made this film especially for the comic book enthusiasts, electing to stay true to its spirit, ignoring the usual Hollywood tendency to ensure a wider viewing audience i.e. children will enjoy it. Studio execs will hopefully realise that this is how comic book adaptations should be made.",10.0,27 June 2003
Very cool!,"Good job Ang Lee! In terms of an action movie, it's really good. In terms of a comic book turned action movie, it's incredible! I liked Spiderman alot, but I found this movie more serious and more engaging. Although the special effects for the Hulk were very good, they were not absolutely perfect. However, I really do believe that they were as good as they could be for today's technology. If you liked Spiderman, X-Men, Tim Burton's Batman, or even the original Superman movie (with Reeves), you're going to like this flick.",8.0,21 June 2003
"Good, but could have been better","The Hulk started off very slow. In trying to get the viewers more acquainted with the characters, Ang Lee failed to keep an eye on the clock. But once you got beyond that, the movie moved at a very fast pace with awesome special effects.

As a former comic book collector, I was pleased with the representation of the comic book character. Unlike The Incredible Hulk TV series, this Hulk was more of an experimental nightmare, rather than some green guy dosed up on supersteriods.

Most people complained of the animated, or computer image Hulk that was used numerous times in the movie. But they have to remember that this is a comic book character, and to be able to make this Hulk just like the comic book, you need the computer effects.

I think where the movie failed was to make viewers really connect with the relationship, or feelings, between Bruce and Betty. I don't know why, but I didn't feel that it convinced me enough that they were really in love. Not the same way I felt about Peter Parker and Mary Jane. Don't get me wrong. I know that Bruce and Betty were in love, I just didn't feel it. There was just something missing. Because of that, there was an almost disconnection in trying to make that love spill between Beauty and the Beast.

Overall, I think the Hulk was a good movie. I would recommend those who haven't seen it to do so. Drink some strong coffee to get through the first 30 to 45 minutes. But once you do, hold on for some great action and effects....8/10.",8.0,3 July 2003
Hulk Smash Me Mind,"Incredible, amazing, splendorific. These words cannot begin to explain how much i loved this movie. it felt like I was watching a comic book for 2 hours and 20 minutes, but not in the bad way. instead in an incredibly good way. The look, the feel. Using dissolves and transition that you are told to never use in the film world.

It has everything. The fun excitement of a comic book and also the integrity that I wish to have as a film viewer. I love the art house feel that Lee brings to the movie. Hulk is not like all of the other comic book movies that have been coming out in the past years where they throw the it right in your face. Hulk doesn't even come into the film until 45 minutes into it.

"Prominent story with good action, instead of good action with ok story","First of all let me start by saying this movie is not your typical action film with a simple story and plot. It is more of a good story which is backed up with good action and not vice versa. A lot of people might go to see the film to see non-stop action, in which case they might be disappointed. Ang Lee is a director who is aware of plot and story development which pleases astute readers. This unfolds the story of Bruce Banner in a way that requires the audience to follow the film from beginning to end in order to understand the way a scientist, Bruce his father and Ms Ross, is able to perceive the well being of individuals and society. Even without such thinking the film is more than well structured with good action with a comic book type viewing. So you shouldn't go and watch this film only for the action if you really want to enjoy. This film is excellent for the past fans of comic books and Hulk.",10.0,5 July 2003
Green is the colour...,"Hulk is different from the rest of the Marvel comics-turned-movies.

First of all, Ang Lee has tried to capture the spirit of a comic book and relate it to the big screen. He makes creative use of split screens and fades throughout the movie. While this is appropriate in the fights and faster (action) scenes, it distracts you from the plot in the quieter dialogue scenes. And yet he still uses them there. It is not as much a comic as Rodriguez' Sin City, yet, especially towards the end when the green man is jumping from canyon to canyon (which I had a hard time getting used to), it is a lot closer to the comic book original than the old TV series was.

The second big difference to X-Men, Spider-Man and the like is: there is no humour in Hulk. Apart from the nerd comment at the beginning and the Atlas pose the Hulk strikes while destroying the laboratory, the movie is a dead serious character drama from start to finish. It succeeds in these points, too, but still it is quite unusual to watch a Marvel movie without snickering even once.

Still, not that bad as some people might tell you.",8.0,22 August 2005
A thinking mans comic book movie,"This movie stands on its own and that the way it should be viewed. If you try to compare it to other comic book adaptions, then you won't enjoy it. And if you expect it to follow the comic book, then you'll be disappointed too. Just as in the television version, the origins of the hulk were different because in modern times, the government isn't blasting nuclear bombs in the desert no more, so I found the origins of how Dr. Banner becomes the hulk orginial. The same thing with Spiderman, there were little complaints about Peter Parker being bitten by a genetically altered spider instead of a radioactive spider and having webs coming out of his wrists instead of creating the wrist web shooters. The movies starts slows and thats what the moviegoer doesnt expect with a summer movie. The action sequences are good when they arrive half way through the film. The directing is good. Ang Lee does a great job, even though some think he was wrong for this movie. The CGI Hulk does appear better when hes in sunlight than at night. Hopefully, Universal Picture will make The Hulk appear better when the sequel comes out, its already been announced there will be one. As I rate movies from ""It was so great I should rent it on DVD as soon as it come out"" to ""This movie was such a waste, I should let a friend rent it when it comes out on video so I don't waste my money, I would buy it and add it to my DVD collection.",8.0,1 July 2003
This movie is simply excellent.,"I guess after the Spider-Man last year, I was a bit tired of those Hollywood movies that just try to make things fun but totally lifeless.

It has very consistent characters and excellent acting with deeply engaged plot. Every moment I was enjoying it. Great Job, Ang Lee.",10.0,29 June 2003
"If you like the Hulk comic books, you should love this movie","This movie has received a great deal of bad press and reviews since it was released. I am struggling to figure out what the bad reviews and comments are based upon. To me, this is the ultimate comic book movie.

Comic books take time to develop characters and story over a mini-series of books and can take up to a year to resolve a story line. This movie manages to pack in wonderful character development with exciting action sequences seamlessly. Ang Lee truly understands what the term ""comic book movie"" really means and he applied it here with a masterful brush stroke.

All of the actors were great in their parts, especially Eric Bana. His simmering intensity as Banner really drove the character in a more realistic direction using repressed childhood memories to trigger ""the change"". Jennifer Connolly was demure and strong as Betty Ross, while Sam Eliott raged as General Ross. Josh Lucas was sleazy as Talbot... just as he was supposed to be. I am not much of a Nick Nolte fan, but he really impressed me in this movie. His performance was totally over the top, but it was perfect for the genre and his role as the villain. To work him in as Absorbing Man really added a personal feel to the story and made the climactic sequence all the more enthralling.

Lee's direction was top notch. There were actually scene changes where he added in the sound of comic book pages turning. The framing of scenes in a comic book style helped further immerse me into this fantasy world. His portrayal of Hulk for the CGI effects was wonderful and reminded me on several occasions of a child throwing a fit. In fact, you could see the physical change in the Hulk over the course of the movie from toddler-like to a more mature, adult looking Hulk at the end.

This movie took the comic book genre and raised the bar to entertain an older, more sophisticated audience. I was not interested in seeing a ""Hulk smash!"" festival when I went to the theater to see this movie. I wanted to see how they handled Banner's transformation to the Hulk and the circumstances that led to the event. The background given to him by Schamus totally and believably explains how a ""normal"" man could survive being bombarded by gamma rays to become the greatest comic book anti-hero of all time.

I have since watched this movie on DVD at least 8 times and see something new each time. It never fails to impress me. There is always something lacking in the latest rash of comic book movies... Spider-Man was never witty or smart-mouthed enough, Wolverine wasn't crude enough... This movie really tied up all the loose character ends and made me care about what happened to all of them.

I am proud that Ang Lee had the guts to interpret this story in this way. His movies are works of art and Hulk should be looked at the same way. This is not some big-budget blockbuster wannabe. This is a touching story of a man's fight with his inner demons and his desire to free himself from the beast inside of him.",10.0,28 June 2007
Great Big Green Fun,"After seeing critics reviews on the Hulk (most of them slating the film), I decided to go and see it for myself. Wow! Was I impressed! I found this film to be one of the best comic book adaptations that I have seen (just closely following X-Men on the excellence scale). The actors are very well cast, and the story is very good. It was slow in some parts but the ending made up for that. The effects were not the best I had seen but I thought they made the film more unique compared with the others because their effects are usually very good and the only thing that annoyed be was the split screens. Overall. I give this film a 8/10.",8.0,6 August 2004
"The Incredible Hulk, and an incredible movie","I saw this movie knowing that, with Ang Lee behind the wheel, it wasn't going to be like the other comic book hero movies. It delved into the psyche of Bruce Banner as a human, so when he transforms into the Hulk you actually know why - and you can identify and sympathize with him.

If you go see this movie hoping that you'll be wowed by nonstop action, be forewarned. But if you want to escape from the everyday world for a couple of hours and and experience what it feels like to release every repressed memory and emotion in your body - you've got to see this film.

"Strong drama, struggling CGI","Of the three Marvel Comics adaptations released in 2003 (Daredevil, X2 and Hulk), a lot of comic-book aficionados considered the Green Giant's big screen counterpart the weakest. I have to say I liked all three movies, particularly X2, which was flawless, and while Hulk has a few defects, I think it's a quite satisfying film.

Everyone knows the story: Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a scientist who, after being exposed to radiations, turns into a big, green brute as soon as he gets angry. With only his ex (Jennifer Connelly) willing to help him, Bruce has two enemies to face: one is the lady's father, general Ross (Sam Elliot), who wants to make our green friend harmless at any cost; the other one is Bruce's own dad (Nick Nolte), who he thought to be dead. Unfortunately, he's alive, and he wants to use his son for his own purposes.

The story, loosely based on Peter David's ""psychological"" run of the comic-book, is one of the best ever written for a big screen version of Marvel's characters. The only ""problem"" (as with X-Men, for example) is that the movie looks and ends like the pilot episode of a TV show. It's like a long trailer, where the characters are introduced and the relationships between them established, leaving the real action in the corner while waiting for an eventual sequel.

On a technical level, I appreciated Ang Lee's way of bringing the comic-book to the screen, particularly the use of split-screen to make some sequences more dramatic. Danny Elfman's music is very good too, as could be expected considering his work on Batman and Spider-Man. However, these merits can't entirely make up for the movie's major disappointment, namely the CGI Hulk himself: he looks great in the close-ups, whereas in any other shot it's like looking at a video-game character (especially in the long sequence where he's running through the canyons).

Luckily, Banner's personal drama works anyway, thanks to great writing and very good acting: Bana and Connelly are impressive as the leading couple, and Elliot is superb. Best of the bunch is Nick Nolte: his portrayal of a revolting man who has no interest in his own son, unless he can get some kind of profit out of him, is perhaps the best work of his career. Also worth checking out are cameos by Stan Lee and former TV Hulk Lou Ferrigno.

Final verdict: as solid as other Marvel adaptations, but could have benefited from better effects work. I mean, even Ferrigno's green make-up from the '70s looks like great art next to some of the CG shots.",8.0,30 January 2006
"A VERY good movie: smart, faithful, and daring.","Because the hero of the Hulk is an emotionally detached young man it took me a while to learn to care enough about him as a character to become invested in his fate and - by extension - to get into this movie. But once the plot of the film began to unfold, and the major father figures played by Sam Elliott and Nick Nolte got into the action, the movie really started to rock.

The action sequences are tremendous and the acting is very strong. Ang Lee's directing is intriguing as well ... and I particularly love the way he evokes comic-book-panel imagery in his shots. The film has a very inventive visual style that is as impressive, or more so, than the Hulk himself. And I did find the Hulk creature great fun to watch, whether he is having a touching moment with Betty or he's fighting tanks or he's part of a horrific dream sequence. Good stuff. Actually, it has been a while since there has been a cool, ""misunderstood"" monster film, and I felt an appreciation for this movie even as I was reminded of classic films like King Kong and Frankenstein.

While faithful to the comic book, this film is actually superior to its source material in that the characters are more realistic and more complex - especially Bruce Banner's father, who has a truly fascinating background and motivation. And it is harder than it looks doing a good job bringing a comic book to life on screen. Just look at the Batman films, which are all seriously flawed. Certainly the movie critic I respect most, Roger Ebert, has yet to really be wowed by any super hero film since Superman 2, and I can understand why ... they sometimes seem bi-polar when they shift from live-action actor to CGI when Eric turns into HULK and Tobey turns into SPIDEY. And a lot of these movies do recycle origin stories and villains like nobody's business. (ie: the endless Joker rehashes.)

You know... it is a very difficult thing trying to come up with an objective way of judging the quality of the super hero movies that have been coming out the past few years, because everyone has a different level of expectation about how realistic the film should be, how fun it should be, how literate the script should be, how faithful it should be to its source comic or tv show, how many punk-rock characters should be included, and how many nuclear countdowns and car chases should be involved. And I bet it is even more difficult for the directors and producers and scriptwriters to decide how they will balance dramatic considerations ... and to do justice to the acting talents of the A-list casts that are being assembled for what was once considered B-movie material ... with the requisite number of action scenes meant to please audiences hoping to be wowed by the latest advances in CGI technology.

Although this balancing act is hard to pull off successfully, I was delighted with the Spider-Man film because I feel that the movie managed to strike the balance quite nicely. In that film, the comic character that I love best was realized wonderfully by Tobey when in his civilian mode ... and he had great fight scenes with the Goblin when he was in costume. I didn't like X2 because I felt that the characters got left behind by one glitzy special effect after another, so I found it to be a very boring and numbing film ... while the more character-driven X-Men (1.5) was a more exciting movie to me because the characters were more real and the actors were given the chance to emote before the camera cut away to the next effects sequence. On the other hand, I thought Daredevil had too many slow character scenes and not enough action. But Hulk, like Spider-Man, gets the mix right. After an admittedly slow first twenty minutes you get great acting AND great action. Intelligence AND spectacle. Very good stuff.",10.0,20 June 2003
Good story,I found it quite amazing that the 'Hulk-staff' decided to put such a strong emphasis on story-telling and character development when they had one of the wildest creatures of the Marvel universe at their hands. I guess it was probably quite tempting not to let 'Hulk smash !' more often during the course of the movie. Besides I found the visualization very strong. I'll definitely watch this movie again.,8.0,5 July 2003
Not What You Necessarily Expect (Spoilers),,8.0,6 July 2003
A surprising (HULK) smash!,"I was blessed enough to get a preview ticket to see HULK on Thursday 19th in London, and i am going on record to say that this movie cripples the other super-hero films out there right now. Having grown up with the tv series, tv films & cartoon i was a bit dubious about hollywood ge ,tting their money grubbing hands on this project but...

This movie nearly has eveything that is needed for a blockbuster, action, budding romance, rivalry, character histories, sentimental values and a explosive ending. The only thing i have qualms about is the fact that it got a 12A rating when there are some disturbing scenes that i will not mention.(See it for your self) I have a feeling that only fans will like this comic to big screen transformation. 9/10

Thank you for listening, L.Wayne",9.0,21 June 2003
Incredibly interesting for the brains and the eyes,"I have to say that I am very surprised as of how the movie went by so fast (the movie really captured my attention from start to end)...and the Hulk character is really extraordinary since it does not really show that it was all computer made....he even has facial traits that really looks real... When the movie was finished, there was an overall excitement in the theater (adults and kids) and most people acted as Hulk....I would just add that I never read any Hulk comics before the movie so I was not influenced in any ways with the comic Hulk character. To see with kids since there is no violence not suitable for kids.",8.0,21 June 2003

A great movie with lots of style to go around,"The Hulk is the latest offering from the suddenly hot line Marvel comic book hero movies. It is dark, exciting and wonderfully stylish. Although the movie suffers a little from its seriousness (a little humor he and there wouldn't have hurt), it is refreshing to see an action movie that tries (and mostly succeeds) to have a more dramatic tone, rather than having to add in gratuitous sex or pointless little gags in order to hedge its bets. The real strength of this movie, and the real reason to go and see the movie, is the flair that director Ang Lee crafts the movie with. He brings the comic book to life and the style of the comic book wonderfully drenches every shot. Case in point, its an interesting new take on the comic book movie genre that really will surprise you. It's certainly not Oscar-worthy deepness but it isn't so cheesy as other action movies are.",8.0,25 June 2003
This is NOT your daddy's HULK so get over it.,"As a former comicbook geek, I absolutely loved Ang Lee's adaptation of ""The Hulk"". From the split screen to the surreal and awe inspiring presence of the Hulk, I loved it. I love when an over-the-top scene that is in words is brought to life on the screen. For you TV series fans, Lou Ferrigno does make a cameo. Can't wait for HULK II. Oh yeah, they'll definitely be one.",8.0,20 June 2003
Great story and even better action-someone poured their heart into this one,"Someone might have said this before, but someone poured their heart into creating this movie. You can feel the emotion while you watch it and you can tell that the material was taken very seriously. I loved this movie. I liked the story, the flashbacks, and I loved the CGI image of the Hulk. Some people thought it didn't look real, but I am sold. It was convincing enough for me to suspend my disbelief and the movie worked for me. I think it sets the new standard for computer generated characters. In the wake of the terrorist attacks, I think these Marvel comics inspired movies are all tapping into something that no other movie can. We all feel vulnerable/powerless at times and need our heros. I loved X-men, X2, Spiderman, Daredevil (which was criminally under rated, btw), but this one might top them all because of the way all elements of the plot tie together so perfectly.",9.0,23 June 2003
I really don't see what people are complaining about,"I've read some of the negative comments about this movie, and honestly, I don't see what is wrong with this movie, I loved it. I think the people who didn't like the movie need to go back and see it another time, and this time pay attention to the slower parts at the beginning. Maybe then, they'll like it.

I'll admit that the opening part of the movie was much slower than the closing part. It also required some concentration on the part of the viewer to fully understand it, so maybe if someone wants to criticize Ang Lee's narration style about the scientific basis for what was happening, then I'll agree. Perhaps showing David Banner as he was doing his original experiments and have him explain the results instead of getting them off his lab notes would've been a better way to go.

When the action gets going, it's really great. The CGI special effects are unexpectedly better in close up shots than in the far away shots. This is the opposite of what usually happens where CGI looks better in distant shots. For example the Hulk looked very natural when it was fighting or resting in the close ups, however it looked very unnatural when doing long jumps and landings, etc.

Also look for the cute way that Ang Lee resolved the David vs. Bruce Banner naming controversy. In the comics, they sometimes called him David Banner or Bruce Banner. Ang Lee decided to give the name David to the father, while Bruce is the name of the son. In the Hulk tv series, they resolved it by making the character Dr. David Bruce Banner (i.e. first name and second name).

I liked it a lot better than Spiderman or the X-Men. But I haven't seen the X Men 2 yet, so I'll reserve judgement.",9.0,1 July 2003
Hulk Smash Evil Military-Industrial Scum,"I bought the Hulk from the first issues and for years later. At first I was concerned at the 'updating' of the origin story but adapted comfortably a few minutes in. Ang Lee's direction, the cinematography and effects were truly at a new level of technical excellence. It was always a joke that the Hulk would expand from skinny Bruce Banner into the giant Hulk and somehow the pants didn't burst off of him and then shrank back when he became Bruce again. Ultraviolence is always acceptable in comics or cinema, not so full-frontal nudity, especially male. Maybe this says something about the 'buried trauma' of our society that makes it so much like the Hulk.

The acting by Bana(Banner), Connelly(Betty), Elliott(General Ross) and Nolte(Bruce Banner's father) was all appropriate and fine. I had actually expected that this movie would be a gross, shallow brute-force-only kind of affair and was enthusiastically surprised to find it none of these.Casting was great. Ross (looking just like his comic-book character) and Talbot exemplify the archetypes so nearly universally despised. Too bad Jack Kirby didn't live to see this.

Great touch of the Arabic music in the soundtrack (which rose up when the heavy desert battle scenes occurred). Most Americans and most humans prefer to root for the underdog rather than the dober-men in olive drab.So gratifying to see high-tech tanks, copters and jets reduced to rubble. The movie took on the evil of militarism and correctly portrayed the demonic weapons development industries.In this jingoist age, I was surprised to see this allowed by a usually official-line tethered Hollywood.I imagine this movie made a lot of warmongers squirm in their seats and call for more pressure for 'patriotic' spin in tinseltown. If there are working theatres in Baghdad now; I doubt the 'coalition' allows this movie played there. Nolte's speech about all the misery caused humanity by these people had us on our feet, going ""YES!""",8.0,12 December 2003
One of the Best Comicbook Movies Ever!,"HULK is an incredible movie. Ang Lee and Co. have shown that one can have a very serious and intelligent comicbook movie while still delivering revolutionary action and special effects. HULK boasts the best usage of CGI ever in film and the special effects of this movie are as revolutionary for the times as T2 and Jurassic Park were in their day. While X2 is a superior comicbook movie, HULK is more spectacular in other departments. The Hulk himself is simply incredible and a couple of the fight scenes are so explosive that they are unlike anything you've ever seen!

As for the plot, direction and the acting? Well, Ang Lee's use of interesting editing techniques and camera work is pure genius and instantly a trademark of HULK. The plot and dialogue are all excellent without any cheese. There were some elements of the story that could've been dropped and a couple of scenes shaved off and the movie would have surpassed X2 in comicbook excellence. The story has a great deal of psychological depth and the psychodrama adds quite a few levels of depth to all the principal characters. All the actors are tremendous and do their parts justice. Eric Bana IS Bruce Banner while Sam Elliot and Josh Lucas both give their characters more depth than their comic counterparts. Jennifer Connelly is great as Betty Ross but it's Nick Nolte who gives one great, grizzled performance. However, the show stealer is the title character who at times is so life-like, that you don't even think it's CGI.

This was a very good story - story, by definition in anyone's vocabulary. This is a good book to read. A good TV show to watch (for its time). And a wonderful movie to watch, as well as a comic book winner. It just so happens it was a comic book first.

Very Cool!,"Do not let any of these negative reviews deter you! This movie is perfect! From the moment I heard they were making a movie of The Hulk, I was very skeptical. I have been reading comics for more than three decades and The Hulk is THE largest, most over the top character in the Marvel toy chest. And Banner was always the most forgettable. Somehow Director Ang Lee gives you both an interesting Banner and a believable Hulk. Don't buy any of these jaded naysayers! The big green behemoth looks great! The backstory is well thought out and the action is in precise comic language (notice that no innocent bystanders die - just like in any Marvel comic.) Director Lee is well-versed in comic language -not only through ""Crouching Tiger"", but remember that ""The Ice Storm"" featured Toby Maguire reading a seminal Fantastic Four comic and using them as a metaphor for his own family.

I know it might not be comic book accurate, I've never read even one, but I feel that shouldn't matter! I watched this film along with the other superhero films that came out in the 2000s and this is one of my top ones, up with Spider-Man 2, X2, you know. I feel that this movie is very unappreciated.

Decent but flawed comic adaptation,"Hulk is certainly deeper than most other films of its genre. The acting is above average, and the story is slightly less cliched than usual. I also liked the comic-book style editing. Unfortunately it suffers from being over-long, from plot implausibility toward the end, and from the look of the CGI Hulk, who appears as though he's made of the same clay as Gumby. I would have liked him to be a darker colour and have less smooth and plastic skin-- maybe then he would be worthy of the boasting coming from his creators (they said he looks more real than Gollum in Lord of the Rings-- they wish).

Pleasantly surprised,"I wasn't particularly interested in the hulk before, I was much more of an X-Men 'Man', so I only went to see the Hulk for the sake of it. I was really surprised to find that the film was actually pretty damn good. The CGI was good enough and not as artificial as one might think from some of the screen shots. I was actually more impressed with the story and the dialogue, even if it was a bit complicated. The performances were good, Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly played the unlikely couple as well as they could have. Nick Nolte was a bit odd, but played the psychotic father quite well. Ang Lee has done a good job here, done his best not to make people think of CTCD, but instead enjoy this film in its own right. The only thing I thought was a bit silly, was when Nick Nolte turned into an electric freak, which spoilt the climax to the film (although the cgi was pretty cool).

Yes, I admit that there were times that the Hulk looked fake and you could tell he was CGI (I thought it was a lot more noticable in Spiderman . . .) but for the most I thought he looked really cool.

good movie but not for everyone,"The Hulk was a very good movie that not everyone will enjoy. This is because of the style of the movie. It is not just a typical action movie with a weak story, it is a movie that focuses on the emotional aspect more than the physical. It tries to get into the mind of the Hulk and Bruce himself. The movie does have some quite decent action sequences with the hulk smashing tanks and ripping apart mutated dogs. The CGI of the Hulk is what a lot of people complained about but it was quite good at parts. One of the strange things was the way they did the scenes. they made it fell like a comic book in the sense that they had different frames with different angles of the action being played. The power of the Hulk was pretty cool ie. bullets bounce of his tough skin, explosions and high power tanks don't stop him, even a fall from the earth's atmosphere doesn't hurt him. All complaints aside this was quite a good movie but might not be your type. I give it 8/10 stars.",8.0,1 July 2003

Not to say I didn't like Spiderman (I loved it) but the Hulk needed to be presented in a different way. This is a story about a man and his inner (and now outer) demons and it has been told in a way that only Ang Lee could tell. This isn't a cartoon romp through New York nor should it be. Sorry if you were upset that Lee was trying to tell a story and not destroy all of San Francisco (though the Hulk did do a number on the city), but that's what Lee does.

This time the director Ang Lee takes the tragic odyssey of Bruce Banner (Eric Banna, simply incredible acting) a scientist who begins his own war when an accident reveals a dark forgotten past creating a powerful and angry creature who lives by the deep feelings of Banner.

A thinking man's comic book movie,"Ang Lee's new motion picture the Hulk is a brilliant mix of CGI action and psychological drama on the relationship of father and son. The sequence of the movie makes you feel like you were literally seeing things in the perspective of a comic book reader. The CGI effects of our giant green friend may seem hokey to some but in it all they are mind blowing. The true greatness lies in James Schamus' terrific screenplay which mixes comic book imagination, sins of the father, and fear of what man can't control into one movie. I have heard some people complain that the film was over dramatic and too dizzying. I have to say to them is first of all this is a comic book movie more in line with the likes of Road to Perdition than Batman and before they watch they need to have more of the sensibilities of comic book fans. This is one of the best comic book adaptation movies I have seen since From Hell. The conflict of Bruce Banner and his father reminds me of the earlier works of Ang Lee in his Father knows best movies.Which proves the Ang Lee is one of the best directors I have seen in years.",8.0,27 June 2003

The Cameras are absolutely wonderful, the unique shots keep you watching and wondering what happens next. At times yes the visual effects could have been better, but that means they would have to spend 4 years on it like the Star War films, for just under two years of production the Hulk looks great. Most of the Scenes are overwhelming. Great Acting, Superior Direction (especially for a comic book film). Entertaining Action and Adventure, and best of all dark emotions. There is emotion in this film which propels this film. (this is where Spider-Man lacked). Overall: 9/10. One star off due to some of the visual effects.

Hulk smash the competition!! Hulk one of the best comic book adaptions out there!! Hulk great!!,"This film adaption of one of Marvel comics greatest and beloved characters is nothing short of genius, this is how all comic book adaptions should be filmed. With a respect,amazing visuals, a good well balanced script and exceptional acting. This is movie making at ti's finest.

2003's Ang Lee directed Hulk is very cerebral and slow paced, but he pace makes it a hundred times easier to follow and understand, this Hulk version follows an almost similar story line to the comics and the 1970's T.V. series it tells a dark and very emotional story of the Hulk's beginning and it paint's a portrait of the Hulk the likes we've never seen before. I've watch this film backwards and forward and I can't seem to place it why people don't like this film, it's extremely enjoyable and very well made, so why? Because it's too slow? Or maybe it's because the Hulk doesn't destroy everything every five seconds.

If you can look passed the slow pace and the lack of action then you've got yourself a brilliant, well thought out and made film.

Everything about the movie is great. The only people that may not like this one will be those who demand an exact recreation from the comic. The Hulk is similar to previous comic book adaptations (such as Spiderman, DareDevil and X-Men) which means that they are all don't follow exactly to the comic books, but are close. The Hulk does differ from the previous comic book adaptations with the camera shots and camera views, making the movie simialar to a comic book.

Best Marvel Superhero movie in the last two decades!,Hollywood critics panned this film because they didn't quite know what to do with a superhero film that was a dramatic story of epic proportions at the same time. Christopher Nolan saw promise in this approach to superhero dramatisation and landed Batman Begins two years later in 2005 and he was lucky that the critics didn't pan his film! I saw this film again in 2024 and it still blows me away and probably marvel studios know that which is why they never made another Hulk movie (the one with Edward Norton missed the emotional intensity). While most of Marvel's recent films have been commercially successful none of them have a recall value like this one! Highly recommend for rewatching.,10.0,5 April 2024
Underrated,"From the opening sequence to the end, this film was not what I'd expected- and it was all the better for it. Although the Hulk action sequences were great, it was the character of Bruce and his relationship with Betty, his father and his big green self, that made me return for a second viewing, a very rare event. It had great acting (esp. Bana and Connelly), pretty impressive CGI, and a few nice, subtle touches of humour. On the debit side there were some clunky lines, several scenes were too dark and the climactic battle was a little rushed and confusing. On the whole though, an excellent film and hopefully time and repeated viewing will do more for its reputation.",10.0,30 July 2003

Superhero movie unlike any others,"Director Ang Lee delivers the traditional comic superhero onto big screen with a whole new approach. Instead of just dumping in tons of mindless action and stupid emotion twists into the movie like other ones (Batman, X-men, Spiderman), we see someone who's more realistic to a real human in the real world. The fear and the emotion in the movie is just so engaging, and the action scenes are superb. CG is good from ILM, music is good too. I like how Ang Lee plays the presentation of the segments on the screen, that's really some refreshing view. I gave it 9/10, recommend for people who has some longer attention span and expect to see something that has more sense than mindless actions. If you love spiderman then you probably won't enjoy this movie, but it is good, maybe just not what you want it to be (with mindless actions again).",9.0,21 June 2003
Good but not great,"Okay, where do I begin? When I first saw previews for this film, I didn't really know what to think. Not really being able to go into a movie theater, I decided to buy the soundtrack first. Loved the soundtrack, but craved more. Finally, when ""The Hulk"" came on video sometime in October, my mother bought it for me and I watched it immediately.

Again, I didn't know what to expect. For starters, the movie begins with maverick scientist David Banner (played as a young adult by Paul Kersey and in his later years by Nick Nolte) experimenting with the human body's ability to heal itself from disease and injury. Forbidden to experiment on humans by his (somewhat?) nemesis General Ross (played as a young adult by Todd Tesen and later by Sam Elliott), David decides to experiment on himself and later, his wife bears a son, Bruce. Years later, Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a scientist like dear old dad also experimenting with using gamma radiation to repair damaged cells. Having grown up in a foster home after his parents supposedly died and plagued by a considerable amount of emotional turmoil and an inability to open up emotionally, Bruce's relationship with co-worker Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) has suffered to the point where they have broken up but still work together. Bruce's experimentations catch the eye of high-and-mighty Glenn Talbot (Josh Lucas) who plans to take the project and tries to con both Bruce and Betty into working for him, but they both refuse. Then, one day, something goes wrong with a gamma ray-emitting device and Bruce rushes to aid of a co-worker, throwing himself in the path of lethal gamma rays. While he survives what would normally kill a human being, Bruce's life is forever changed as now, whenever under extreme stress or rage, he transforms into a 15-foot mass of green monster that later becomes known as the Hulk. General Ross, who turns out to be Betty's father, takes notice and seeks to capture (and then destroy) the Hulk while David Banner comes around and begins stalking this troubled but docile son. Soon, all hell breaks loose as various characters (Talbot, General Ross, and even Betty included) make one poor decision after another, but I won't spoil you with the exact details.

The plot was fine as it gave a more reasonable explanation for how Bruce survives what would usually kill a human. The only thing great about this movie was the music, courtesy of Danny Elfman. The acting was fine, but nothing that could warrant an Academy Award nomination (no offense). Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Sam Elliott, Josh Lucas, and Nick Nolte all handled their parts well. On Bana's part, this is something Christopher Reeve could've pulled off if only this film were made in the late 1970's and if Reeve hadn't done ""Superman"" (no offense). On Nolte's part, his performance was something Christopher Walken could do in his sleep. Overall, this movie was good but not great like last year's ""Spider-Man"". In my humble opinion, the musical soundtrack and the novelization by Peter David is a bit better than the film.

I give this film about a 4 of 10 on a scale of 1-10.",10.0,9 February 2004
Excellent. Don't let the naysayers fool you,"Despite a few draggy moments and the somewhat somber tone, Ang Lee's adaptation of ""Hulk"" really shines. It's easily the strongest Marvel comic book adaptation I've seen, the most human and creative. All because of Lee, who is a stellar director and completely re-writes the book on how comic book films should be constructed.

Frankly, most comic book films are silly and stupid. That's a fact. They are made by second rate hack directors who have very little strength or ability to put their own peculiar stamp on the material. We get lots of films like ""Daredevil"", ""Fantastic Four"", ""Elektra"", and ""X-Men"", and even the overrated, sub-par and hilariously stupid ""Spider-Man"" which has CGI so wretched it looks practically transparent. These films rush through plastic, hastily composed expository scenes headlong into disposable action scenes.

""Hulk"" is completely different. This film has been imagined by a real film maker from the ground up. The film breathes and has a real life to it. The CGI is solid and dense. It seems to have weight and volume. The action scenes have a genuine sense of mass colliding against mass. This is what superhero films need.

Filtering through it all are the recurring motifs of desert vegetation, reptile and marine life, and science. The hulk is basically a raging child, smashing everything and anything that gets in his way. It's exhilarating to watch, and yet through it all Lee brings to the film a strangely serene feeling. There is a sense of great freedom and peace underneath all of the anger. That's part of what makes it such a great film.

Not to say that the film doesn't have a few problems. The script is needlessly convoluted and is sometimes ambiguous about who the bad guys are. And the strapping, inexpressive Bana is miscast as the main character: a nerdily repressed scientist. Also, kids may find it dull and its probably too violent for small tykes.

The only problem with the Hulk is it doesn't deliver on that count. But with a superb script, and performances, the film makes it up to the smart and intelligent viewer. Another connotation associated with the Hulk is that it's based on a comic, and that comics don't have serious themes, and adult situations. The Hulk proves that wrong as well. The film is a blockbuster of another breed and quality. The Hulk is also not the stereotypical `Superhero.' He doesn't quip one-liners, laugh at his opponents, or get the girl in the end. He is just a force to be reckoned with. It was blasted by many critics and average Joe movie goers because of the bad advertising. It's a shame the producers of the film couldn't make a trailer that reflected the serous nature of this film. Ang Lee has crafted a masterpiece for senses if you're willing to give up a little bedlam. The action seems even better sense your somewhat starved for it. Plus allegations of poor effects are wrong; the Hulk lives and breathes in this film.",9.0,28 July 2003
Hulk smash puny formulaic CGI flicks,"What can one say about Ang Lee's the ""Hulk""? Some has said that the film has too serious an overtone to be ""Comic book fun"". But, why is that a bad thing? There are too many films out there that offer non-stop action with no discernible story line what so ever, catering to the TV fed ""30 second"" attention span generation, leaving the rest of us frustrated to be bombarded with an endless tirade of generic action films that rob each and everyone of us out of $8-10, two hours of our lives and another failed expectation. I can honestly say that the Hulk was not what I expected. It exceeded my expectations. Finally, a film where the story was given precedence over CGI and explosions and not vice versa.

Many had expressed dissatisfactions over the CGI, expressing that it was too ""fake"". One question? How can you make a 15 foot, muscle bound, invincible green monster look ""real""? Plus, I can honestly say that the CGI are the last thing I care about when I see a film. Too many films have been ruined because the concentrate more on the CGI than the story itself (Jar Jar Binks anyone? No? How about Jurassic park 2 and 3? Still no?). Plus, the CGI were quite nice and sublime and went beyond what I had expected them to look based on what I had seen in the trailers.

A film is a medium used to provide the audience with a visual narration of a story, not a two hours computer graphics demonstration. The Hulk provided me with an entertaining story, the CGI were just pleasant window dressing, and for that alone, I can honestly say that the Hulk was both time and money well spent.",10.0,20 June 2003
Finally a movie that keeps the feel of the original,"I wasn't sure how I would like the ""CG"" HULK before I went to the opening today. I have to say that, having seen it, it was great. Using the CG Hulk helps this movie keep the feel of the original ""Incredible Hulk.""

If you like the original Hulk comics, you should like this movie. It even has a comic book look and feel to it during certain scenes. (you'll have to see the movie)

All in all, I really enjoyed this movie. Just one nagging thought that has been on my mind for years....what's the deal with the pants??? Don't think about it too much...just enjoy the movie!",8.0,20 June 2003
People crazy,"I'm not sure what everyone is on about when they describe this as the worst film of the year (or ever)--it's every bit as good as, if not better than, last year's Spiderman. It would appear there's something of a culture clash when an art house, albeit populist, filmmaker aims for a summer blockbuster. The only thing wrong with Hulk is the packaging as it seems to have misled the target audience into thinking it was going to be the same old/same old, though why people used to a reheated tv dinner would object to a gourmet meal is beyond me. Hulk isn't your typical summer fare but at a time when Hollywood would seem to be choking on the fumes of completely exhausted formulaic full throttled sequels, one would think this kind of originality, flair and quality storytelling in a mainstream film would be more welcome. I guess those who flock to the multiplex prefer their beans on toast.

Visually stunning, well written with excellent performances, Hulk's special effects are closely tied to the main character's journey of self-discovery--meaning they appear when necessary and when integral to the plot. Most blockbusters are probably constructed in opposition to that credo. Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte give terrific performances as fathers locked in a duel to the death while dealing emotional damage to their children (Connolly and Bana). Connolly gives a respectable performance--which is more than can be said of her work in A Beautiful Mind--and is well cast as the feminine influence that calms the Hulk. Lee gives her character, Betty Ross, far more dignified material than Fay Wray or Jessica Lange ever got in their beauty and the beast vehicles. Bana is obviously working to his director's very strict brief for his character, Bruce Banner, giving a very controlled, restrained performance. It is some credit to Bana and Lee that the three actors who play Banner throughout the film all seem to be cut from the same cloth--Bana's Bruce is very much the adult we would expect such a muted, tormented child to become. Bana, though not responsible for the cgi performance of his alter-ego, Hulk, serves this material well by serving the story--that's really all an actor is supposed to do. (How can you grandstand when you're playng the Hulk?) Lee paces Banner's trajectory from an emotionally controlled stick figure to a raging hulk with masterful assurance--I mean, what did people expect? Banner would bust out of his shorts right after the opening credits? Hulk is necessarily a slow burn, folks, leaving Lee and company some distance to travel.

There are memorable, nail-biting sequences galore. The derision that has greeted the cgi effects is just misplaced and goes to show how some initial bad word of mouth can easily sway the masses. Frankly, I'm not sure what more people would expect--when the Hulk appears he seems every bit a product of genetic engineering, of scientific experiment gone wrong and yet somehow soulful. The sequence with the genetically modified dogs is as terrifying as anything I've ever seen at a multiplex (and that would include the patrons). When Hulk breaks out of his military prison and is pursued relentlessly across the desert as he tries to make his way back to Betty, it is completely engrossing as we discover the full extent of his endurance--by this point the film is in full flow. I was sobbing by the end of the sequence as Connolly makes her way toward the Hulk and we see them both collapse into each other's arms--I mean, it's just a movie, folks. What more do you want? How about watching the Hulk being flown into the outer atmosphere and dropped from a staggering height? It certainly left my mouth gaping. Throughout, Lee's meticulous homage to Marvel Comic's framing puts the material--especially the script--in the perfect context. It's like the film is bowing to it's origins throughout--it doesn't pretend to be realistic, it's about images and framing that immediately and economically communicate motion and pathos to the reader. (I mean, cinema goer.) Characters speak with the economy of the thought bubbles or narration one would find in a comic book--it's refreshing to see this material transferred to another medium without losing the unique narrative of a comic book or graphic novel. Lee is very faithful to the style of his source--as anyone who's actually read a Marvel comic would tell you. Like all the great Marvel heroes, Hulk is about duality, about the shadow that is a part of all our characters. By the time we arrive to the final showdown between Bruce Banner and his mad scientist father, David, Lee reveals the jewel in his crown: Papa Banner, mercilessly winding up his freak of a son, says, ""The more I GET to you--the more you GIVE to me!"" It certainly sounded like the crux of a father/son relationship to me. It's a moment that equals if not surpasses the ""with great power comes great responsibility"" ethos of Spiderman (an ethos that, rather ironically, has apparently gone ignored by Americans in their quest to remake the world in their own image) and acknowledges the darkness and depth of humanity that a comic book can reveal.

Given the complete inanity of the trailers that preceded the film (formulaic retreads like SWAT, from the makers of 2 Fast 2 Stupid and, heaven help us, XXX--can't wait!), I suspect that multiplex audiences have been conditioned to consume large doses of destruction without any subtext and certainly without caution. Hulk must have seriously disappointed those that just like their blockbusters to go BOOM! without questioning the nature of our destruction to ourselves and others. Although the sad, unspoken commentary throughout is the level to which audiences have been dumbed down when a simple parable of this nature is somehow classified as demanding. If nothing else, the response to Hulk exemplifies that audiences can no longer sit still and listen for longer than three minutes at a time.",8.0,23 July 2003
"Decent movie, fantastic hulk, a sequel free from the burden of backstory should be better.","This is a decent movie. Not a great movie, but a decent one. There are some areas of contrivance (Bruce who doesn't have any memory of his parents or his life before they were taken from him just happens to work with and just broken up with Betty the daughter of his fathers boss AND he works in the exact same field in science as his father) but I always say that if you're thinking too much about this kind of stuff while watching an ""entertainment"" movie like this then you're just thinking too much. That being said the movie does try to be serious and put more into it than just entertainment so perhaps it asks for this level of analysis. The biggest problem this movie faces is the same as spider-man and xmen faced (and dealt with more successfully). Back-story. How do you get all the backstory the fans love into the movie and not just have it turn into a big exposition movie which relies on a sequel to allow the franchise to really shine. Hulk goes about this in an entirely different way than Xmen and Spider-man did. Those movies kept the title characters right up front and made the movie about them. You learned about the backstory in XMen via small scenes and conversations that were not central to the plot of the movie. With Spider-man the backstory was the movie but it was very much inline with the comic and the theme of the movie was straight out of the comic and centered on the title character. In Hulk the protagonist is not The Hulk, it is Bruce Banner. The Hulk is something that happens to the protagonist as part of the events of the movie. Although he takes more of a center stage towards the middle/end of the movie he is never really the focus. The focus of Hulk is the theme of the movie. The title character is a side effect of the theme rather than the theme being a side effect of the tale being told of the character. Basically the focus is inverted from that of the comics which focus on The Hulk and use him to tell the story or theme of the issue in a subtle way. In the film the theme (rage) takes center stage. Rather than having to look into the actions of the Hulk to see the theme you almost had to look beyond the theme in order to see the Hulk! The best way I could put it is: Instead of making a movie about the Hulk which had a message they made a movei about a message which had the Hulk in it. Which I think was the mistake that drew the ire of the fans. While initialise disappointed with it the movie has grown on me with each viewing on DVD and is now one of my favourites (admittedly mainly for the last 3rd - which is when the hulk comes out for a long play). Hopefully a sequel will be made (the film WAS profitable) and there will be more of a balance between Banner and Hulk (and possibly even more Hulk than Banner). If they make the focus more on the Hulk and make the theme of the movie more subtley told and not so upfront I think they will be more successful.",8.0,29 December 2003
Many excellent sequences make this worth renting,"From the opening titles sequence, where we see a starfish's arm sliced off to illustrate regeneration (the starfish will regrow the missing limb plus the arm will grow into a whole new starfish), I knew this adaptation was being played very serious. Trust Ang Lee to turn a typical comic book story into some serious philosophy of the good and evil that lurks in all of us...and add to that the eternal conflicts between fathers and sons.

That being said, this isn't the movie I would have made. There are too many minor nitpicks in the story that could easily have been fixed. First, I would have preferred a more realistic and less comic book rendition of the Hulk. Just as most musicals destroy any illusion of reality when everyone simultaneously bursts into song, this film's CGI is way too reminiscent of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" for my taste. Second, the film's time frame should have been placed further into the future so that the pivotal genetic science aspects would more accurately parallel reality. Finally, it was plausible on the TV show for Lou Ferrigno to still be wearing tattered trousers after the transformation since he was maybe about 6 inches taller than Bruce Banner. It isn't plausible if the Hulk is King Kong's size, as Ang Lee has decided to portray him.

Everything else about this film though is topnotch...you can see every cent of the $120 million+ they spent making this, right up on the screen. If you don't go into this with too high of expectations you will likely not be disappointed.",8.0,20 July 2004

Better than,"Thank you critics for lowering my expectations, because as far as I'm concerned Hulk Smash. People in the media tainted public perception with heresy or speculation the Hulk looks fake, before seeing the film firsthand. This is not a man in a rubber suit or a stuffed-shirt super hero hung by string against a blue backdrop. Movies ARE fake. If you can believe in little green men, why not giant green men? The new reality is that computer animation is far more superior to an actor with a 20-million dollar price tag.

Trailers didn't do the movie justice. The film has all the story lines working--boy/girl, empathy for a misunderstood underdog, betrayal, villains, mystery and the best action sequences I have ever seen. You can forget TV Hulk Lou Ferrigno. Animators cranked up the volume on this Marvel Comic super hero to an unimaginable pitch.

Following Spiderman, the Hulk is the next step into creating a world of Marvel legends come to life, and hopefully unite on one screen for some real fake fun.",10.0,9 July 2003
An Entertaining and Refreshingly Ambitious Movie,,8.0,8 May 2008
An Unjustly Maligned Movie - Mild Spoilers I Suppose,"Ang Lee takes a simple idea and tries to reinvent it and mostly succeeds. Sadly, most people are familiar with the seventies television show where a scientist turned into a hulking bodybuilder with a green wig whenever he got mad, something that would have been laughed off of the screen.

Instead this is about a driven scientist who experiments on his own son, a son with a repressed memory. After an accident with radiation, whenever he starts to remember this incident he turns into a massive computer generated giant. He'll need his new abilities to fight the return of his father - and the entire military.

The attacks against this movie are laughable, mostly because people haven't considered the other options. The Hulk doesn't appear for a while. In most great movies, the pivotal character doesn't appear early, Jaws being the best example of that. The character is computer generated. A man in a wig would have been laughed out of theaters, so it was computer generated. Yeah, it looked fake, since there are no fifteen foot tall green men around. Let it go. Yeah, every time he gets mad, he doesn't turn into the Hulk. That was cool for the television show, but for a two + plus hour movie, that would have been stupid. Basically, every time he was in a traffic jam, out of decaf coffee, or dropped his pen, he would turn into the Hulk. This is a cool movie that requires some patience. Yeah, its a little overwrought, but an ambitious film that misses excellence is still pretty good.",9.0,28 December 2005
Better than I Expected,"I read somewhere that Ang Lee did not read any of the comics in researching this project, but did watch the TV show. Ultimately, I'm glad that the writer read the comic and was pretty true to it. I thought the Hulk looked quite impressive, for the most part, despite the early shots in the previews. All in all, I enjoyed this movie despite assuming that it would positively suck. I realize that it will have its detractors, but I really think this was a well-done film.",8.0,22 June 2003
Ang Lee overcomes the script,"Not your average comic-book adaptation. Ang Lee has created a film that is a textbook for directors. Even when the plot stumbles over itself, Ang Lee deftly saves the film from itself. This film is a visual delight.",9.0,18 June 2003
A thinking persons movie that delivers.,"Going into the Hulk I wasn't expecting much. But much to my surprise this movie delivered. It is a thinking person's movie, the plot is carefully crafted, not only through dialogue but though imagery. Paying attention is important, even in the starting credits, as the story development is quick and deft. This movie is very dark and I would not think that kids or the action junky would appreciate it for what it is. Also it has some scenes that were emotionally strong and violent, but may come across as scary and disturbing to the little ones. Therefore PG13 may be a little lax on the Hulk.

I never felt that the action or acting were completely over the top. I have found myself saying,"" Oh Brother"" in many movies lately, but not with the Hulk. Near the end of the film, I did feel it was getting overly serious, but with his excellent craft, Nolte brought the story back to it fanciful theme. Nolte was brilliant in his role as David Banner and while this movie my not be the vessel for an Oscar, Nolte's acting bares resemblance to Oscar performances.

So well directed, written, and acted, that the green man could have been Gumby and I still would have enjoyed it. Bravo!",8.0,21 June 2003
ENTERTAINING AND GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS,"This movie was very entertaining and the special effects were awesome. It was great see Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte back on the big screen.

"One of the year's best, even though it isn't as good as it could have been.","I don't understand why so many critics and moviegoers disliked this film so much. If one paid any attention at all to the massive hype surrounding ""Hulk,"" one should've known that it was going to be a departure from the character of the Hulk/Bruce Banner as he has been portrayed before. If you went to the movie uninformed, you can only blame yourself...

In contrast, I never appreciated The Incredible Hulk until I saw this film. Ang Lee whips up some juicy psychodrama at the beginning which, unfortunately, is never properly resolved. The stars of this movie are Sam Elliot(in an uncharacteristically reserved performance), Nick Nolte(who puts his heart and soul into a difficult role that a lesser actor would fudge), and Josh Lucas(who plays a smug _____, which is his specialty). The only regrettable thing about ""The Hulk"" is that Ang Lee set out to make an artsy, ambitious film based on a comic book. Somewhere along the way, the film got away from him and the conclusion is somewhat unsatisfying. It's still one of the year's best(so far).",8.0,3 July 2003
Wow,"Probably my new all time favorite superhero movie, narrowly beating out SUPERMAN and SPIDER MAN, even though those movies are more funny and light, which I usually prefer.

I don't know how young kids would like it though (there WERE a ton of them at the theater I went to).",10.0,30 June 2003
"Fantastic, weird, powerful - a real classic","Clearly a movie that has divided opinion. You either get it or you don't. Should have been called Son Of Hulk though. I thought TV series was great when I was kid but this is so much better.

I loved it and I wanted to see it again immediately. I just wish there was a little bit more of that crazy hulk; just so well done. Deliberately cartoonish but so powerful. The contrast with Dr Banner was about as complete as it could be.

The best film of the year so far. I can't understand how anyone could walk out - I was gripped from start to finish. This is the Asian take on Superheroes/ Monsters - what a refreshing change from the normal and unxchallenging formulaic offerings like spotty kid Spiderman.",10.0,23 July 2003
Excellent Transition from print to screen,"In truth, the Incredible hulk is a barely veiled retelling of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde"" but it has always been a favorite of mine. As a person who loves and collects comics, I was worried that this movie, like so many others, would ignore the subject matter. I was right.

The plot of the hulk and the circumstances of his origin do not follow the stories from the comics and I really don't know why, but strangely... i found myself not caring too much. Quite simply.. the movie rocked.

I must tell you that you have to be patient. Almost an hour of the movie goes by before any action starts. and i was seriously saying ""GET TO IT ALREADY"". Once we first get a glimpse of the Hulk, however, its all over. In my opinion, this is the single greatest realization of a comic book character to the screen. I edged to the tip of my seat and gripped the armrests watching the violent emerald behemoth. It actually made me want to break something or roar out-loud! The screen often breaks into comic book panels with action going on in different windows, which i found really cool and interesting. and the acting is quite good. You can feel the primal rage of banner as he squirms in anger... it looks like he is going to explode trying to repress his emotions.

There are a couple of small problems. A) The first half of the movie is really slow. not bad, just slow. Kids will find it unbearable. B) Resolution of the main villain's plot is a little goofy.

Other than these things, this movie is a definite ""Must see"". Marvel Comics is making a respectable Offensive in bringing their characters to the screen and the Hulk is definitely one of their better attempts.

Go see it now -Jace",8.0,26 July 2003
Smashingly Good,"I've never gotten into comics, really, so I go into all these comic book movies with no background. I just have to evaluate them as movies. I enjoy the X-Men movies, but I found Spiderman interminably dull and predictable.

I thought Hulk was smart and engaging. It's a good MOVIE first, and good comic book movie second.

People are complaining that the setup is too long. I thought it worked well. It's not enough that Hulk smash(!) -- it helps to get an idea of what it is inside Banner that makes Hulk smash.

I thought the action sequences did a good job of giving insight into Banner's inner workings. I like the fact that various characters' motives are ambiguous.

Kids probably won't appreciate the depth of the film. More than requiring thought, this film encourages thought. It encourages dissection. It encourages analysis. And the more I think about it, the more I enjoy it.

It's not dumb summer popcorn entertainment, and for that I'm extremely grateful. I'll be back for repeated viewings.",9.0,23 June 2003
Best Comic book movie since 1989's Batman,Finally a movie which captures the essence of the character it is based on. A little mellow dramatic and maybe it drifted a little from the original story it still fulfilled and far exceeded my expectations of the movie. With great acting and even greater CGI/special effects the fact that more people didn't love this movie is a complete mystery. Ang Lee has really out did himself this time and has became the first director who was able to not only capture the complete essence of the character but he was also able to capture the essence of a comic book. A sequel is being hoped for and going to be long awaited. It is easily the best movie I have seen this year. Matrix Reloaded and X2 can move over and take there place as the lack luster sequels they were. Easily the best special effects I have ever seen in a movie. Point blank this is the best comic book based/superhero movie I have seen since 1989's Batman.,9.0,28 June 2003
Great movie,"I feel I am alone in saying this but I think this movie is great! It beats Spiderman hands down. Has anyone tried watching Spiderman again? Power rangers and dodgy CGI abound, along with some pretty dire acting. This film has the most realised and impressive CGI work I've seen, a true depth to the themes of rage and family. Nick Nolte is a bit over the top but that is really the only fault I can find. Its an incredible piece of work by a great director. The only better superhero movie I can think of would be Xmen 2.",9.0,12 February 2004

I Don't See Why It Is So Hated,"It may not be 100% true to the comics, but its pretty good. I don't really care if it is not 100% true to the comics, but it is the comics.

I am a big hulk fan. I love the TV series with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, ever since i was a kid. I used to read the comics, but not anymore i guess. And i liked the movie too.

It was really a comic book movie, with the comic book panels on the screen, that was cool, and comic book come to life, i did not really find it distracting, it was creative and new. This movie is obviously more based on the comics, so no Lou Ferrigno running around in green paint. I thought the action scenes were pretty cool, especially the desert battle. But it is a little hard to see the action during the night scenes, such as the fight with the dogs, but you can see it though. I thought the special effects were cool, a few spots may look a little fake of course. The hulk may not be shown too much on screen, so it can show some talk and stuff. But it is a very intelligent movie and not goofy or anything. The music in the movie was very good, with the Hebrew music and stuff. The acting in the movie was serious, Eric Bana wasn't bad, and that goes for Jennifer Connelly, Sam Elliot is good as always. I think Eric Bana has a good thing going for him. The ending of the movie is good, but a little goofy and corny, but it was good. The story may not be everyones cup of tea, but i kind of liked it, even though the science stuff can be a little confusing.

I really don't see why a lot of people hate it so much. I have been waiting for the movie a long time before it came out, and wondering how it would be with Ang Lee directing it, and Eric Bana being Bruce Banner. It turned out well, and intelligently. The model and special effects of the hulk were good, the action. I am looking forward to the new hulk movie next year, hope it's good. I just hope it is not a complete remake like people say. I hope it would have a sequel resemblance to it.

So, i give the hulk movie about 8 and a half stars out of 10.",8.0,10 September 2007
Decent enough,"I haven't seen a lot of Ang Lee's previous films. I caught ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and enjoyed it thoroughly. He seemed like a strong choice to helm the Hulk, or at least give the comic/hero genre a go. I can't say i was ever a big fan of the Hulk, before my time really but he never struck me as a real hero. The whole point was that his powers were a curse upon him and with that in mind i thought that Lee may be able to make a different kind of film.

It started out well enough aside from a rather dissapointingly bland performance from Eric Bana. The rest of the cast is superb, Nick Nolte in particular. The story moves along swiftly and soon the Hulk is romping and stomping. The problems start when Lee tries bringing some of the comic book elements over to the screen too literally and a lot of the action just looks stupid, almost like it belongs in a parody.

The films is well shot and edited toghether but half way through it feels like Lee is having something of personality crisis. One half is trying to inject a decent story with depth whilst another is trying to make it marketable to the kiddies. It was always going to be a struggle and with that in mind Lee deserves credit for his boldness.

It's worth the price of admission in any case it's still one of the better films I've seen this year. Just don't expect your typical superhero film.",9.0,31 July 2003
Why are people amazed it aint an action film???,"I have yet to see it yet but I am already amazed by the amount of people saying there is not enough action or the action scenes are few & far between!

Did you see the original series? Did you read the comics?

The Hulk is not a violent character by definition, he is cursed and trying to control his new found 'disability'! If you wanna see action, see Matrix or Daredevil (if you dare!) but Hulk is a guy cursed with a weakness of character (or in retrospect a strength of will) who is trying vainly to control his rage and not become that which he hates, a controless animal!

It is not a story of anger and hatred but bravery and hope...!

If you enjoyed but thought Spiderman was cheesy 'blockbuster' style, and looking for a movie with character development, awesome effects see the Hulk.",10.0,25 June 2003
Best of the recent comic book adaptations.,"Hulk is a surprisingly good movie, and will please someone who has been disappointed by Spiderman or - shudder - X2 in recent months. It has much more psychological depth than either of those two offerings (easy, when compared to X2) and Ang Lee uses some ingenious effects to convey the feel of a comic book. This especially shows in the very creative cutting of the movie. Scenes change not just by fading into each other, but by weird shifts, in-laid boxes, etc., just like the pages of a comic book. A great way to pay tribute to the original medium and make it obvious that the movie is not here to represent reality.

As for the acting it is good and convincing. Actors being mainly just hollow vessels for the dialogue in the script, they do the job well. The script is very good, especially because it is serious about the personal issues of the main characters and doesn't degenerate into a succession of mediocre one-liners as in most recent superhero movies. Nick Nolte seems to have been asked to play himself, which is rather amusing: he looks exactly like his recent drunk driving mug shot...

Another funny bit is the obvious references to the computer game Half-Life. A huge underground laboratory is an almost exact copy of the one in the game.

All in all a film I can truly recommend, if you want to go and see something superhero-ish and with good effects. Kudos to Ang Lee for his visual creativity.",8.0,18 July 2003
It stands somewhere with Batman Begins and X-Men 2,"Really good movie. Nick Nolte is great, action sequences are spectacular and story is top-notch. One of the best superhero movies ever. Hulks anatomy looks very realistic and the whole movie is true to the hulk Mythology.

The Incredible Hulk, on the other hand is a pretty useless film. Totally boring and predictable, typical Hollywood. Ed Norton should have stayed out of that movie.

WATCH IT!

Ha! Worst movie of the year? No!,"No, absolutely not. I think Ang Lee's version of The Hulk is beautiful to watch and a lot more serious than other new `comic movies'. The sfx/cgi is very well made and does not overlap the story/narration, a common problem in new action movies like Matrix: Reloaded for example. The great music by Danny Elfman is also worth pointing out. I liked it, almost as much as I like spider-man. And almost as much as I hate Dare Devil. The Hulk: 8/10",9.0,9 June 2003
Hulk Runs Wild!,"Incredible! The word synonymous with the legendary angry green giant known as the Hulk also describes the latest Marvel Comic theatrical release of the same name. The infamous comic tells the story of Dr. Bruce Banner. A brilliant scientist who when he loses his temper transforms into the property-destroying green colossus. Following in the recent string of comic hits such as, ¡§Spider-Man¡¨ and ¡§X-Men¡¨, ¡§The Hulk¡¨ continues the trend with outstanding action sequences accompanied by a great script.

Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a scientist who studies the effects of gamma radiation UC Berkley. All his life, Bruce has suppressed his emotions. He does not become easily angered nor does he lash out at anyone. He does, however, have horrible nightmares that leave him waking up in a cold sweat. His partner and ex-girlfriend, Betty Ross (Jennifer Connolly), is his constant supporter, helping him through his difficulties. While repairing a gamma-emitting machine one day, Bruce¡¦s assistant accidentally activates the machine to go off. Shielding his assistant, Banner takes the full force of the radiation. Suddenly, Banner feels stronger and healthier than he¡¦s ever felt in his life. But his new health comes with a terrible side effect. When he becomes enraged, he transforms into the enormous, destructive Hulk. Banner now struggles to subdue the beast within, a battle that the new night janitor (Nick Nolte) may hold the key to winning.

The marvelous partnership of director Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and screenwriters John Turman (Time Killer) and James Schamus (Ice Storm) give ¡§The Hulk¡¨ life unique from a typical comic book movie. The masterful direction of Ang Lee is practically enough of a reason to see the film. One of Lee¡¦s unique methods of storytelling in ¡§The Hulk¡¨ is his prodigious use of the split-level screen. This allows the audience to view every possible angle in the scene and to further advance the story. The split-level angles also give the film a more ¡§comic book¡¨ feel. Just as there are multiple scenes illustrated in the graphic stories, they are also presented in ¡§Hulk.¡¨ Lee¡¦s direction does not limit patrons to simple one-dimensional point-of-view. Rather, it allows the viewers the take in the whole picture. While some purists may argue with the film¡¦s version of the Hulk¡¦s origin, Turman and Schamus regardless present a very enjoyable story. The writing duo does not simply pen a script about a man who turns into the beast when he becomes enraged. Rather, they focus on the more underlying factors of Banner¡¦s anger. Why has he suppressed his emotions? How has it affected his life? Will he ever be able to control it? However, Turman and Schamus have not written a mere psychological evaluation. The movie tells a good tale and is packed with stunning action sequences that comic fans have come to expect from Marvel. Turman and Schamus bring the best of both sides to the screen.

Eric Bana sells the role Dr. Bruce Banner. More concentrated on his work than anything else, he does not let relationship break-ups or other matters steer him off track. Bana keeps his character¡¦s emotions in check. While he may be angry at someone, he never lashes out at them. While the film¡¦s Bruce Banner is perhaps a bit more brave than his comic book counterpart, Bana¡¦s portrayal of Banner is just right to the contrast of his angry alter ego. Jennifer Connolly¡¦s Betty Ross is almost a scene-stealer of the movie. As Betty, Connolly is the everlasting crutch for Bruce. She is always there for him and is his calmer whenever he feels stressed. It is Connolly who brings the emotion of the film. Her faithfulness to Bruce and her desire to protect him from himself comes through in her performance for it is Betty who can still see the man behind the Hulk. Audiences can feel her sincerity and grief as she struggles to help her ill-fated friend. Nick Nolte delivers with the mystery and aura that emits from his character. No one knows where the recluse janitor came from or what ulterior intentions he has planned at the institution. Nolte¡¦s performance of the mystery man evokes both compassion and hatred. Whereas one moment it may appear he is helping Banner with his research, the next scene he may appear to sabotage it.

¡§The Hulk¡¨ is a terrific movie and has all the elements to make it remembered for years to come. Not only are there eye-pleasing effects but a good story, remarkable score, and superb directing accompany it. Moviegoers and Hulk fans will appreciate Ang Lee¡¦s comic-like directing and the great performance by the cast. ¡§The Hulk¡¨ is not to be missed in theatres for patrons will well receive their money¡¦s worth. ¡§The Hulk¡¨ is simply: Incredible!

underrated marvel movie,"when hulk came out i waited to rent it on DVD because i heard so many negative remarks about it, then when it was released onto DVD i rented it and was amazed that so many people didn't like it, this has been and always will be a favorite of mine, Sam Elliot is so good in this movie, then there's Eric Bana who did good though i think Edward Norton did better, and both Liv Tyler and Jannifer Connoly did great, i don't know which movie i like better between Hulk and The Incredible Hulk, there both great achievements in my book, i heard so many remarks that Hulk had to many stories to follow, but i thought though there were many stories in this film it was still easy to follow, and not only was the acting great but the effects were top-notch, at the time that i saw it it was my favorite marvel movie, though i have recently stumbled upon The Punisher which is amazing, but this will always be in my collection.",10.0,19 June 2009
"HULK SMASH! (and man, does he smash well!)","Okay, this movie had a few holes in the plot, and there were some things I would've changed about the story, including choice of main villain. And Ang Lee used the comic-book-page transition effect a little too much.

That said, I came to see the Hulk in action, and MAN! Was I pleased! Yeah, he looked CG, but you know what? I didn't care! His mannerisms, his strength and power, his innocence... These were things the movie got perfect to a T! When the Hulk fought, the audience (myself included) cheered out loud. And with good reason! Here was the green giant himself, brought to life to the true extent of his power and being for the first time ever. Lou Ferigno had a fairly good as a powered-down made-for-TV Hulk, but this is a role that no ""puny human"" can truly play. The Hulk movie brought one of my favorite comicbook characters to life, and for that I give this movie two big green thumbs up!",9.0,27 June 2003
I can't believe they actually pulled it off...,"Going in to this movie, I didn't expect much. The trailers and previews all looked really bad. I'm not even that big a fan of the Hulk. But...the tickets were free...so why not?

I walked out of that theatre completely amazed. I can't believe they managed to pull it off. I found myself saying words I'd never expected to hear uttered - ""it's good.""

Now, that isn't to say that the movie was the greatest piece of cinematography ever...or that it had no flaws.... Merely that it was a good film. The acting was good, the story was entertaining, plenty of action, and amazingly enough the CGI was believable within the context of the movie.

I honestly did not expect to like this movie. I would not have gone to see it if the tickets were not free. But having seen it, I am very glad I did.",8.0,22 June 2003

This movie has it all.,"Drama. Action. Excitement. Emotion.

The most beautiful, inventive transitions I've ever seen.

Is Bana the star? It's tough to say, Nick Nolte does an amazing job as David Banner. Sam Elliot puts in a sterling performance as General Ross. Connolly is not at her best, but she is quite captivating just the same.

As for the Hulk? Forget people complaining about the CG; it's a league ahead of the likes of last summer's Spiderman, and a much more powerful movie to boot.

Another Ang Lee work of art.,"This film works.

Ang Lee makes films that flow and feel alive and this film is no exception. There is so much beauty, mystery, and emotion throughout this film that one cannot help but to feel awe and humbled.

The story is a bit thinner than previous Ang Lee films but if you go see The Hulk expecting a mere comic book movie you might be disappointed. There is much sadness and tragedy in this film and most of it is too dark for small kids (there was one child or another crying throughout 90% of this movie). That is not to say it is not an exciting film. I just feel that it is more exciting as a unique vision in film-making rather than just action for the sake of a thrill-ride type excitement.

Go see this film if you want to see an Ang Lee film. Skip it if you are looking for just another comic book turned into the latest summer blockbuster action/comedy.

And yes the hulk looks real about 98% of the time, he has emotions and resemble a larger version of the actor all of the time.

(8 out of 10) -Karl",8.0,23 June 2003
Not your typical summer blockbuster/comic adaptation,"When you go to see a summer blockbuster in the movie theater, you pretty much have an idea of what you are going to see before you get through the opening credits. Usually, you are in for good special effects, pretty good acting, and a lot of action. Things usually explode, people die, and when you leave, you are not totally fulfilled.

The Hulk, from the start, sets out to do the opposite of what you would expect from a comic book turned movie with a $150 million budget. Sure, you have your gratuitous action scenes where things explode and people die, but you get a whole lot more. This movie is all about the story of Bruce Krensler/Banner and his father and Betty Ross and her father. We learn a lot about why the characters are the way they are today. There are a lot of emotions and excellent acting. Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot in particular, shined with their performances. If there is one problem with this movie, it is that it is too smart and sensitive for its target audience. It is probablyh not action-packed enough to please the scores of young children and teenagers who just want to see things blow up.

Ang Lee should be commended for this movie, as I am sure there were plenty of people at Universal Pictures that fought with him over his vision of this movie. He went out and made this story his own and succeeded in blending an action/comic movie with a dramatic picture. In addittion, his work of the split screens was trememdous, adding an extra element to the comic book feel.

Overall, this is a very good movie, but suffers a little bit in the same way that the original X-Men did. There is a lot of story to tell and both of these movies were not made to stand by themselves; they were treated as the first movie in a series of movies. X2 was significantly better than the first, as would a second installment of The Hulk, if it does indeed come to fruition. I give this movie a very good 7/10, with room for improvement in a sequel.",8.0,20 June 2003
Unexpected,"I was not expecting the film to be at all like the film I just sat and watched. To be honest I thought from the trailers it was going to be another Spiderman boy was I wrong.

Visually and story-wise, it was a beautiful movie. The characters were so real. And after watching it, I also knew that the viewers' opinions would vary greatly. There would be the people who appreciated the tale told to them and wanted to fall into it. The other camp is the EXTREMELY LAZY, short-attention span people who only wanted 120 minutes of CGI and an explosion every 3 seconds.

Good,"I really liked this movie. It is not as good as the classic comic book movies like Superman I and II, X-Men I and II, Batman, or Spiderman. I thought the acting in the movie, particularly Jennifer Connelly and Nick Nolte, are very good. However, the movie takes a little too much time with the backstory. At about 2 1/2 hours, the film is too long. As for the CGI Hulk, I liked it. It looks like the Hulk came from the comic book. He is supposed to be about 9 feet tall and CGI was the only way to show the Hulk realistically. I will see it again to see what I missed the first time. Overall, a good movie but no classic.",8.0,20 June 2003
see it before someone ruins it for you,"I'm a big fan of Jen Connelly. I saw the commercials and said, ""oh no, a CG Hulk movie?"" Spiderman was ok, Willem daFoe and Sam Raimi was a good combination but definately a kids movie. This movie really captures a feel of modern comics, yet wasn't written for 12 year olds. Ang Lee knows when he's got something good too. Can't go wrong w/ the longest and closest camera shots of Jen ever. I do admit the cg jumping got to me a little but that was the only problem I had. Now I realize that cg Hulk was the way to go, growing to about 15 feet instead of the Lou Ferrigno size. This is the only comic story that I'm actually looking forward to a sequel.

It's intelligent with barely any holes, and has enough intricacy to make you want to see it again to catch all of the little things that are chocked into this 2hr18min movie.",10.0,23 June 2003
The film gets a bad rap like no other...,"This film is one of the best action films I've ever seen, and aside from Spider-Man 2 and Dick Tracy, this is the best comic book film of all-time. It has incredible characters and emotion, incredible suspense, and thrilling action and special effects. Ang Lee delivers ten fold.

As with the original Superman, this film takes a while to set up. But unlike Superman, Hulk's setup is enthralling... Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly team very well with Lee to bring this film's character development far beyond what you're used to in standard blockbuster films.

Of course, the action is incredible. Sure his pants never rip off, but who wants to see the Hulk's hulk anyway? I'm just not that curious. It's a sad thing when that's what people find to hold against this exceptional film.

The best scene of the film is towards the end, with Hulk running all over, being chased by military vehicles of all sorts. It's a visceral scene unlike any other scene in comic book films. While the whole film is magnificent, this is the scene I always rewind and watch again.

Don't believe the negativity. This is an insanely interesting character piece about losing complete control, wrapped in a very expensive, very impressive action film. I recommend this over and over again.",10.0,2 February 2005
Highly worthwhile action/sci-fi movie,"The Hulk was definitely a phenomenal movie that was worth seeing. Although it's a comic-book movie through and through, it was undoubtedly a character-driven movie, as the character development made for a long setup (I definitely wanted the action to kick in quickly, but I had to be patient, which is some ways was a good thing). When the Hulk did manifest, it was explosive, especially in the drawn-out build-up of Bruce Banner's (Eric Bana) bottled-up emotions. In the very least, the actor did very well in spilling out Banner's long-suppressed temper. Some of the sci-fi was over the top, but this was definitely not a pervasive trait of the movie. Well-done comic-book movie. 9/ 10",9.0,24 June 2003
This time the fury has been unleased,"There have been many comic book movies onto the screen: The X-Men films, the Batman saga, Spider-Man, Dick Tracy, Daredevil, etc. Now in Ang Lee's Hulk, it's quite different than the following films I have mention. What makes it unique is the fact that Ang treats the comic book itself like a comic book, where the scenes are cut into strips leaving a sense that Lee knows what he is doing.

Hulk starts with the prologue of a young David Banner (an older version is played by Nick Nolte) as he tries to work on gamma rays with species he already kills, in the beginning his character is banned from the U.S. Army by Col. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (an older version played later by Sam Elliot) because he injects gamma rays on his son Bruce for which he has no reaction and afterwards Banner sets off a radioactive bomb for which the base itself will explode along with the people living there. David tries to kill his son but accidentally kills his wife in the process.

Years later young Bruce Banner grows up (played by Eric Bana) and works at a facility research, for which he now has flashbacks of things that look obscure to him. His assistant is the lovely Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly), the daughter of ""Thunderbolt"" Ross. Like his father, Bruce is working with gamma radiation on wounded animals, and in one scene, a bullfrog blows up after exceeding too much gamma rays. I like that scene because it shows how much experiments can go bad.

Though there aren't any bad guys for the film, but there's one that people will consider a ""villain"" and that character is Glenn Talbot (Josh Lucas) who wants to use the formula that Bruce and Betty are using and put is as a weapon of destruction for strength increase on the soldiers for when they go into battle. He bribes Betty and Bruce, but decline the offer.

Later in the film, an experiment goes awry as Bruce saves the life of a lab partner from gamma radiation, but has the rays infected on him. In the film he jokes ""I'm not going to blow up,"" but later on he has a visitor: a janitor who looks like a bum, claims that he's Bruce's long lost father, bringing a trio of dogs with him as well.

Bruce doesn't transform into the Hulk until one night after locking up the laboratory in which his father knows that his son has grown up to be the creation he'd started when he was young. The monster itself may not look like the original from the TV series, but take my word; he is mean and more ferocious than ever. With the CGI helping, the Hulk is realistic and with Ang Lee's movement involve, the Hulk has never been angrier. In one scene, the Hulk helps Betty from a trio of dogs (who are Nolte's dogs) and the woman realizes that Bruce is the monster.

I know after watching the movie, some readers wouldn't agree as I say that ""Hulk"" is a masterpiece in story and action. I stand by my decision when I say that Hulk is ten times better than Daredevil, and that Ang Lee tries to remain true to comic book fans when it comes to telling a story about a comic book hero and how an outcome of a science experiment has gone bad.",10.0,22 June 2003
Much gratitude to Ang Lee!,"Love it because:

1. The movie avoided typical summer blockbuster formulae.

2. Nick Nolte, Sam Elliott, Jennifer Connelly.

3. CGI, and the human qualities of Banner showing through the monstrous appearance of the Hulk.

4. Many folks will have their expectations dashed and will complain that it's not full of typical summer blockbuster formulae. That means I get to feel superior. ;)

5. Obvious connection to comic book origin/atomic testing parallels, while changing origin in order to more richly explore just how bonded Banner and Hulk are; there is no separation.

6. In spite of that fusion, we care more about Hulk than Banner.

Didn't like:

1. Overwrought dog-fighting scene, plus animal testing sequences make this a not-very-animal-friendly film. Thumbs down on that.

2. Silly ending made me roll my eyes.",9.0,25 June 2003
Astonishing and Very Underrated,"Ang Lee's adaptation of ""Hulk"" is an amazing achievement in visual storytelling, cinematography, and computer generated effects. While the substance attributed to the story may not go as deep as other comic-book films such as ""Spider-Man"", it attempts to dabble in the matters of relationships and love, and how they effect us in life.

Bruce Banner is exposed to a dose of Gamma Radiation in a lab accident, awakening a strain of abnormal genetic material he inherited from his father; himself a scientist searching for the key to rapid healing and immunity processes. Acting as a sort of controlled cancer, when Bruce is overcome with emotion, his body transforms, and he becomes the Hulk, a giant green monster, created skillfully by Industrial Light and Magic. Many people have complained of the quality of the computer effects, particularly with the Hulk himself, but I certainly felt these were some of the best computer generated images I have ever seen. There are several shots that I could have sworn were real.

In terms of content, as mentioned before, the film plays on family and relationships as lovers and friends, to show how they impact us on a personal level, though made larger than life because of the Hulk's problem. Ultimately, I feel Ang Lee was searching for a deeper, more provocative meaning in the film, but the limitations of the plot kept him from taking it as far as it could go.

Overall, I feel the visual storytelling in the Hulk, with the delightful ""comic-book"" performances by the cast, make it a must-see film for fans of action and suspense.",8.0,27 January 2005

A Classic.,"I watched the movie yesterday amidst mixed reactions from movie-goers. And I finally understood what some meant when they wrote that the Hulk is for people who want to be entertained at a more intellectual level.

The Hulk is definitely not X-Men 2 - don't expect action from the second the movie starts till the time that it ends. What the movie is really is about good old fashion story-telling. It's more like the original Superman the movie, and takes it's time to establish character background and so on. Unlike what some naysayers had said, the movie didn't drag for the first hour because Ang Lee did very well in the character build-up. The first hour seemed more like fifteen minutes to me because the story was told so well that I was engrossed in what the characters had to say.

And when the Hulk finally appeared...I was blown out of my mind. All my fears about a CGI Hulk vanished into thin air as the experts had done their homework and the Hulk looked incredible. What hit the spot for me was the facial expressions of the green creature that really exhibited the humanity beneath the monster - greatly illustrating what the Hulk is really all about, a person cursed rather than a blessed super-hero.

Sounds like I'm taking apart a literary piece of work? You bet, 'coz the Hulk is a classic. And that's why some people hate it.

Ang Lee's American Masterpiece,"First off, I'd like to say that superhero movies get a lot a of bad hype. They're not bad movies, it's just sometimes telling origins gets in the way or the director/producer doesn't take enough of a creative license with it. Ang Lee did an excellent job with Hulk. Of all the superhero movies I've ever seen (which is nearly all of them), this one remains the pinnacle of underlying philosophical substance (excepting possibly Raimi's Spider-Man). Hulk deals with how sorrow, anger, and all the other related emotions can build up within a man and can manifest physically. Admittedly, no one will become big and green, but that's more symbolic of the kind of monsters people can become. Hitler, for instance, was hardly an eyesore, but when it's all said and done, he remains one of the most atrocious monsters in the history of mankind.

Hulk's plot was a rather interesting spin on Bruce's life and his relationship with Betty. Again, I enjoyed the creative license they took with the property, and I even enjoyed the little twist at the end between Bruce and his father. When I saw this movie, I was on the edge of my seat. I could feel every bone-crunching hit between Hulk and the mutated canines. I felt all kinds of emotions during Hulk's battles, including the jet scene. I felt so much in the movie I could almost smell Ross's breath during his close-ups. I loved this movie, more so than even Spider-Man who happens to be my favorite American superhero. And to be honest, I was never really a Hulk person. On a scale of 1-10, I'd have to give it a solid 9.",9.0,28 September 2003

The detractors are missing something (taste? a brain?),"I actually avoided the Hulk for a year and eventually watched it on DVD because the cinema queues were too long for Spiderman 2.

I consdered the possibility that maybe I liked it because I had low expectations, but know - it was great. My only real criticisms are that the Hulk appeared too intelligent in green form and that there was no spark at all between Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly - were they meant to be lovers then? We had a collective ponder as to why it is this film had so much negative critique and quite frankly we're baffled.",10.0,17 July 2004
A very good adaptation,"The movie ranks among the higher comic book adaptations to the big screen. Not better then Spider-man or X-men 2 but certainly better then Daredevil, Blade I & II, and the original X-Men. The Hulk is innovative and intriguing. A must see for any action thrill seekers.",9.0,21 June 2003
Fantastic!,"Seeing this 2 days after being completely disappointed by T3 was a breath of fresh air. The acting is fantastic, the writing is great, the character development is well-developed, the cinematography is uniqe, and the action is so exciting.

The trailers do not do the special effects justice. Yes, they do look a little unrealistic. But this adds to the comic book style of the whole film anyway. Ang Lee has done it again! 9/10",9.0,16 July 2003

Ang Lee Pulls it off.,"This has really been dividing people and critics alike. Personally I think it's a great film. I guess that people expecting the usual summer blockbuster no-brainer might be disappointed, it might (shock horror) make them think a bit! There's been criticism that Ang Lee has tried to mix art-house sensibilities with the comic book blockbuster but as far as I can see it he pulls it off admirably. Ok, you don't get to see Hulk smashing things up straight away but when you think of the TV series you didn't in that either. The spilt screen comic book effects work perfectly and really look wonderful. The story is well told and the hulk himself looks great - when the action comes it's worth it! Overall I feel this film deserves to be up there with the other great comic book adaptations like Spiderman, Batman and X-men.",8.0,14 August 2003
"When he loses control, I like it","Alright, I just saw the Hulk, and I personally thought it was better than Daredevil and Spiderman put together! Ang Lee does an incredible job presenting the Hulk as a real person with real emotions. I have heard complaints about how long the movie was, but I believe it was necessary in order to develop all the characters fully and to believe in all the conflict that is going on between the chracters, especially between the overbearing parents and the young scientist children. My friend even told me that he didn't like the movie because, ""It took forever to see the Hulk.""

Although this movie may not be the typical marvel action movie i.e. Spiderman, it makes the transition smoothly because the Hulk was never a typical superhero. He was more the Mr. Hyde to Bruce Banner's Dr. Jekyl. Fans expecting to come in and see the Hulk during the first 10 minutes will be sorely disappointed. The film takes its (much needed) time to explain what happened to Bruce and why he would be so angry. It explains why the Hulk would even come out in the first place. All in all the direction was great, with the split screen sequnces which gave the movie a comic book feel, the acting and characters were believable, and the movie was a great delve into the mind of a man with a tortured past. There is little comic relief and the movie plays out more like a drama with the Hulk in there to take care of Eric Bana's (Bruce Banner) more violent scenes. I appreciated the psychological delve into the mind of the Hulk and appreciated the character developement on all sides. Good flick, although not really for the younger generation who would probably be bored by all the talking.",9.0,24 June 2003
biggest and best summer movie so far,,8.0,13 July 2003
"the vicarious thrill of it all is so cathartic, so much fun, you'll practically have to stop yourself from shouting, ""Grrr..Hulk smash!"" to the screen","Unlike popular perception, the Hulk is a monster and a curse, not a superhero, who is supposed to instill fear and awe in `puny humans.' The movie comes close at times, but with a $150 million budget, you'd think we'd be more afraid of this CGI Hulk than Lou Ferrigno's fright- wig-and-green-body-paint version - we're not. Still, the scenes where the Hulk is in action are fresh and exciting enough that the film well earns your nine-plus dollars. The snail-paced, `human' scenes, however, seem to be competing with the screen curtain for sheer torpidity. At least these occasionally joyless moments will give you plenty of time to get more popcorn and take a leak, or even a long, luxurious dump, depending on where you are in the two-and-a-half-hour movie.

While the action sequences are truly great, it bothered me that the original comic book storyline was actually toned down, believe it or not, to the detriment of the film's believability (isn't the stereotype supposed to be that comic books are the kids' medium?).

In the comic, Bruce Banner's father is a physically and verbally abusive, raging alcoholic who beat Bruce's mother to death. After witnessing this, young Banner fell to the floor, emotionally frozen, cradling his mother's bloody corpse without shedding so much as a single tear. In the film, the father is a mad scientist who, in one clumsily staged piece, accidentally falls on someone with a knife. I guess a murderous father with a drinking problem doesn't make for a best-selling action figure.

The emotional impact was further softened when Ang Lee jumbled up the character's history and muddled the story in an attempt to make this a more ""personal"" film. Add up the incessant comic-strip-style, multiple-screen-splitting (which after a while grows into more of a tiresome distraction than an innovation), the Enigma-esque background music (enough with the idea that Middle Eastern wailing and chanting automatically translates into a movie being soulful), and angst-ridden, soft-spoken dialogue (WHY IS EVERYBODY WHISPERING? WHAT'S THE SECRET?!?!? HERE'S AN IDEA -- EVEN TORTURED SOULS SPEAK UP EVERY NOW AND THEN, GODDAMMIT!!!), and you have an often self-indulgent, art-house-wannabe film that should have been called THE INCREDIBLE ANG LEE'S hulk.

Great directors and screenwriters are supposed to know when to get themselves and their egos out of the way of a story. The people behind this tale apparently never learned that Screenwriting 101 lesson. Nor did they learn that just because you're writing a comic book story doesn't mean it's okay to stuff it with bad-daytime-soap-opera-level exchanges such as one silly scene where General Ross tells his daughter, `I'm so sorry,' and she responds, with predictable earnestness, `I know you are.' Second-rate comic book writers, at their cliché', hyperbole-loving worst, would have known better.

Throughout the film, Eric Bana's, Jennifer Connely's, and Sam Elliot's acting, much like the uneven script, runs the gamut of impressive creative achievement to borderline-embarrassing hack work.

As for Nick Nolte, well, he's very busy doing something on the screen, but I'm not sure if you can technically call it acting. He's running around stalking people, shooting himself up with experimental drugs, and biting into electrical cables. I had a funny feeling this is what he'd be doing even if there wasn't a movie happening around him. Nolte's portrayal of David Banner had more ham in it than Mama Cass in '74.

Since such a large chunk of the film's production time was wrapped up in just coming up with the look of the Hulk, I'm hoping that when the sequel arrives he'll appear much more, well.incredible, and a great deal more savage. You'll surely admire the humanity in Hulk's face (unlike the previews, the Hulk comes across as a better-than-average CGI accomplishment). And you'll probably be surprised how quickly you'll forget the whole `support the troops' business and start rooting for a giant, green monster run amok to crush all of our military defense forces while causing as much collateral damage as possible to our very own streets, homes, trees, government buildings, sewers, and even a poodle.

In fact, the vicarious thrill of it all is so cathartic, so much fun, you'll practically have to stop yourself from shouting, ""Grrr..Hulk smash!"" to the screen.

But that's not the point of the Hulk (not the whole point, at least); he's supposed to have you trembling in your seats. This one just made me a little shakier than usual.",10.0,1 July 2003
Hulk was very good,"The has gotten a bad rap. I think it was a little long and drawn out, but it was a good movie overall, like all Marvel movies. The CG was incredible. I can't stand when people say it looks so fake, because this is a fictional character, and you have to have an imagination to see that it is amazing. I'm excited to see the sequel when it eventually is released.",9.0,27 July 2003
The Hulk Rocks,,8.0,21 June 2003
"Good movie, brings what you wanted, and more you didn't ask for...","First of all, the Hulk is an entertainment. It is definitly, the most comic based movie, it includes all that you can find when reading a comic book. Some liked it, others didn't. So Marvel came back with an other baby, but this one is too big not to be considered. The story is a multi-layer plot. It's both a great adventure, but also a search within. You can't take the movie too seriously, they are not trying to make you believe it can be true. They want you to have a nice time. Most of all the visuals were awsome (not only talking about Special FX). The end is ""not"" that satisfying but I rarely saw a movie with a sensational end (let's say it was classic). To conclude... well Ang Lee, gave his personal touch to an all american movie, and gave it some emotions you usualy never see on big screen. (Note: After lots of anger or action, you see the peace of the world - you'll see in the movie) ( 8/10 )",8.0,20 June 2003
Finally a comic book movie done right!,"Ang Le did pull it off. This was both a human-interest movie and a superhero movie. He paid homage to a 60's comic book hero. Some may think that there is excessive time spent on Bruce Banner and Betty but the hallmark of the Marvel revolution in the 60's was the greater emphasis on the human side of the hero. Some comics had more interesting story lines when the hero was not in his tights or purple pants.

I went to see the Hulk with reservations. First he was not one of my favorites--Spiderman held that role. Second, his angry destructiveness could be a turn-off for a date. Third the trailers made the Hulk appear computer generated and not lifelike.

To my surprise, I enjoyed this movie more than Spiderman. This movie had a strong human-interest component. But the real strength was the use of split screens. So often, the screen took on the appearance of a comic book page with panels showing views from different perspectives.

My date identified with the Hulk in spite of his destructiveness and computer generated nature. Despite the impression left by the trailer, he really did appear to be human with emotions crossing his face.",10.0,29 June 2003
Don't expect a typical action movie,,8.0,23 June 2003
This is a beautiful film,"The Hulk is, with the possible exception of Spider Man 2, the best Marvel Comics film so far. The CGI, though it appeared ridiculous in many previews and commercials, was pretty impressive in a theater. The acting was generally very good, and if the script was at times corny, you have to remember that cheap melodrama is the essence of the superhero genre. The film was beautifully shot, particularly in the Mojave Desert scenes, and the comic book style was superbly emulated through occasional screen division showing a scene from several angles at once. The themes and motifs are not clumsily and overtly forced into prominence as they are in the other Marvel movies. The music, while repetitive, is effective. On the whole, the Hulk is an underrated and brilliantly directed art film/superhero story.",8.0,12 July 2004
Brilliant Exploration of the Human Psyche and inventive filmmaking,"First off, let it be said - this is NOT just an action movie. If you want a an incredibly inept slam-bang summer action thriller, you'll probably be disappointed, since aside from one or two outbursts, there's not tons of action until the last half hour or so. Purists might also want to note that the hulk's origins as well as some other things have been changed from the comic. I never really liked the Hulk comic much, though when I was younger I faithfully read no less than 10 marvel comics on a regular basis, and this wasn't one of them. However, Ang Lee does a brilliant job at turning the Hulk's rage into a wonderful metaphor. Beneath the veneer of a comic book film we have a metaphor for the psychology underlying our parental relationships in a consumer culture in the same sense Crouching Tiger was clearly a film about the political independence of a nation hiding amidst what was ostensibly a martial arts film. The film's Oedipal themes are incredibly intriguing, though ended in a somewhat unsatisfying way. The film's editing and Ang Lee's use of varying camera angles to depict the same creative geography in different ways violates anything I've ever seen in Hollywood editing and is wonderfully inventive. It resembles comic panels more closely than any other comic films. A very dark, intelligent, and deeply psychological film as well as brilliant cinema. It's too bad more mainstream films couldn't be this good. 99% of it will go over the heads of the audience watching it though.",9.0,28 June 2003
"FEAR,GREEN,GODS,MONSTERS AND THE USA.","First of all any one who hasn't seen this movie should go out and buy or rent it now. Make up your own mind and don't believe some of the really negative reviews written. They are clearly written by people who were expecting HULK to be a no-brainer,one dimensional action film.

You should not go into this movie thinking its going to be another comic book superhereo movie. This movie was made by the makers of Crouching, Tiger Hidden Dragon,James Schamus and Ang Lee.They don't make one dimensional movie, but movies with many layers. The HULK is more a FRANKENSTEIN movie, where David Banner(Nick Nolte) creates a monster. The movie-makers by using the characters from the comic book have made a $100 million work of art.

So the people who haven't seen the movie, and those who didn't like it should watch it again and think what the movie makers are trying to say in the movie. You might not understand much of it , but the more you think about it, the more you'll begin to understand the movie.",9.0,1 May 2004
Ang lee has a unique take on the comic genre,"I saw a workprint, so it's a given that some of the things may not appear in the final version, but overall i enjoyed what i saw. Ang lee ditches the now typical formula for Marvel films, of flashy effects and more or less mediocre story line. Instead he's produced a much darker films comparative to the original Batman. This movie is intensley plot driven, don't expect to see the hulk withen the first 45mins-hour. Naturally, this bothered me my first time through, but after seeing it a few more times, i appreciated what it does for the antticipation as well as the flow of the plot. Nolte does a good job of playing banners insane father, which seems to be his forte of late. One thing i found interesting is the use of multiple frames in a single shot, which i assume is meant to mimic the frames in the pages of a comic book. At first i thought this was something to do with the workprint, but while somewhat unnesecerry, it helps you remember that this is a comic book story at times when it seems more like a serious drama. Don't expect the lighthearted romp you got with spiderman, or the painfull experience of daredevil. Lee delivers a mysterious, dark, and at times depressing film deserving of your $7-$9...and yes, the hulk does smash alot of stuff, and yes, it's boss.",8.0,10 June 2003
I can't believe they made this,"I am the kind of person who writes good things about a movie but in this movie even if I want to write good I just cannot. This movie had some good action sequences but they are not enough to make a good movie. The story is good but still they do not show much of hulk in the movie. This movie makes you feel sleepy at times. It picks up pace in the middle and loses it again. Although everyone's acting(especially Jeniffer Connelly,she is really good looking and a good actress) in the movie is pretty good. Watch Terminator 3 instead or watch hulk if you must.",10.0,5 July 2003
Genius,"Ang Lee may be the greatest director on the face of the planet. This movie was perfect. And I don't mean that lightly. From its score to directing this movie had it going on. Being both a fan of the comic book and the TV series I can say this did justice for them both. As for the Hulk him self. I don't get where people are saying he looks to cartoonie. In my opinion he looked just like he does in ninety percent of the comic books. CGI was the best it's ever been and better than that in the Matrix movies. This was one of the most visually stunning movies I have ever seen. And I've seen a lot. I gave this movie a 10, and I don't care who knows it.",10.0,21 June 2003
"Fantastic, Much, Much Better Than Expected","The film stayed true to the comic book by accurately portraying the size and dimensions of the Hulk. I thoroughly enjoyed myself through 95% of the film, although the ending got a little too wacky for me. That said, I did enjoy the comic books and I can see people not enjoying it that are unable to suspend their disbelief of unrealistic storylines involving superheroes. If you didn't like X-Men 2 (I gave that an 8) or Spiderman (7), don't bother with Hulk.",9.0,24 June 2003

Masterfully adapted from a comic,"At what part of watching a movie adapted from a comic book causes some people to forget that it is ADAPTED FROM A COMIC BOOK. It is not supposed to be believable. Ang Lee doesn't even try to make it any thing else, and thankfully so. From the opening credits the audience is pulled into a fantasy world that is bound by the panes of a page. But this movie isn't some mindless summer popcorn seller; it is a film that wants you to feel the hero's pain. This film succeeds both technically (CGI, sound, editing) but also but also from a solid script that tells a solid story.",9.0,21 June 2003
"Hulk gets an 8 from me, but...","I rate Hulk an 8 simply for my respect for Ang Lee. Love Jennifer Connelly. Nolte nice to see. Overall, I get the lower ratings. Hulk came off a little long for me.",8.0,22 June 2019
Enjoyable but confusing character development,"I give this film a 7. It's generally entertaining and gripping in some moments. Let's first dispense with the usuals. The CG is nice. Hulk's skin is a little too smooth, but the animation is nice, especially where he kicks the sh!t out of some M1s and Comanches. Definitely sweeeet. Acting is also ok, as the actors hit all their cues. Bana is suitably morose, Nolte is insane, and Jenny Connelly is every grad student's wet dream. There's also the right proportion of smash and mayhem to flashbacks and angst to plot development.

So what's wrong with the film? Well, it's confusing. Not the plot (well, the ending was a little weird), but its characters. We never quite understand who they are and what drives them. Bana's character is so ""emotionally distant"" that we never learn what his fears and hopes are, just a pastiche of flashbacks which don't add up to actual motivation. Nolte is also confusing, mostly due to lack of exposition. Is he just a mad scientist. Who was he trying to better, himself, his son, mankind, or just his ego? And how did he change in the 30 years he was locked up? You may ask why these questions matter. It's because by not answering them, the film ended up being episodic and disconnected. The action seems insipid, without an underlying impulse or logic. It's more cartoon than comic book, if you make such a distinction.

That said, this film still has more ""intelligence"" (read ""bite"") comic book movie fluff and beat'em ups. Unlike, say, Spiderman or (barf) Daredevil, it makes you want to know more about Banner and his dad, even if the film doesn't quite provide the answers.

BTW, this film could've been 9 if Lee developed the characters more. It was quite enjoyable.",8.0,20 June 2003
The Hulk as he was meant to be!,"I agree with those who say this movie is not for everyone, but not due to any fault in the movie itself. Ang Lee has presented a brilliant, undistilled version of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's original vision, and it is breathtaking to watch.

Unlike other Marvel characters, the Hulk was conceived as a tragic character, almost gothic in his original incarnation which dates all the way back to 1962. The 70's TV show was good in its own way, but often substituted melodrama for real pathos. IMHO no director but Ang Lee could have rendered this vision so accurately or so vividly, yet remain true to the essence of the characters and the story. And yes, Sam Elliott is perfect as ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, and Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly nail their parts as well.

Parents beware: this is NOT a kid's movie! It is very intense, and some scenes are truly frightening, so leave the little ones at home.",10.0,22 June 2003
"Great movie, not to be confused with a Superhero movie","If you enjoy good film making and the Hulk (duh) then this movie is a blast. DO NOT expect a spiderman-ish, teen-friendly romp with Eric Bana making out with Jennifer Connely. It is a well paced, incredibly well edited, story driven experience of a movie.

Bruce Banner is a character you must understand before you can enjoy. He needs the Hulk to act out his inner emotions, which can be seen oh-to easily in the dog fight sequence where his love for Betty overcomes the freedom and power based urges of the Hulk. I loved this movie and am proud to say I bought the DVD the day it was released and saw it three times in theaters.

Hulk is a great movie, give it a shot, you wont be disappointed unless you only care for idiotic, stereotypical characters. However, if you are under 12 and/or are impatient, skip the first 45 minutes of the film. Trust me, I had to force family members to do the same.",10.0,4 July 2004
Unique,"Having just watched 'Hulk' I'd have to say it is completely unique to the current crop of 'Comic Book Action Hero Movies'. Unique in the fact that it is actually a decent movie.

Ang Lee manages to present an involving Origin story without getting too bogged down in the details and leaving you constantly wanting for the few extra clues to Hulk's back story, while still paying attention to what is happening in the present. Amazing action, great story and brilliant acting, a first rate example at how to recreate comic book's on the big screen.

Basically it comes down to this, did you enjoy X-Men 1 or 2? If so don't watch this movie as it's on a completely different level that you just won't understand.",8.0,9 July 2003

Excellent Comic Book to Screen Adaptation,"The failure of ""The Hulk"" was one of marketing. People went in, perhaps, with a certain set of expectations based on the trailers (""Oh, it will be just like 'the X-Men'"") and instead found a much more ""artsy"" film. When you want to see super villains and explosions and, instead, get psychological depth and pathos, you are bound to be a little disappointed.

That being said, I found ""The Hulk"" to be a pleasant surprise. There are many things to recommend it, but I would like to focus on the editing. This is, in my opinion, one of the first movies based on a comic book that actually looked like a comic book. Split and multiple screens allowed Lee to give us multiple reaction shots all at the same time. This was, for me, great fun.

Every writer and artist who take over the comic book take it in their own direction. I believe Lee did the same thing when he took charge of this project. Lee's ""Hulk"" isn't an awful lot like the one in the TV series or the most recent comic book versions, but it is one worth visiting - without any preconceptions about style or content.",8.0,18 December 2003

Incredible,This movie so far has been the best I have seen this year. I really enjoyed the build up of the movie . True there is some minor differences from the comic. I don't think any true hardcore geeks will mind the change it seems to fit better with story. Even though it takes about 30 to 45 mins for Bruce Banner to transform into his Big Green Alter Ego the story doesn't seem to slow down and draw on . My interest in the movie was intact from beginning to end and that is really good considering I am easily distracted. This movie deserves a 10 out of 10 in my opinion it is just as good as Spider-Man was .,10.0,9 June 2003
Epic Movie,,,20 June 2003
Don't take the little guys.,"My 6-year-old grandson called me to ask if I'd take him to see THE HULK. I thought it was going to be a cartoon, so said yes. He started out two seats away from me, moved to the seat beside me, and ended up leaning against me with his hands over his ears. The scene with the dogs did it and we beat a hasty retreat. It was then that I saw it was rated as PG-13. So don't take little kids to see this one--it will scare them.

On the other hand, I hated to leave because I thought everything was exceptionally well done--the graphics and photography, the acting, the special effects. One thing that made me smile, since I watched the series on TV in the '70s, was seeing Lou Forrigno, who played the original Hulk on television, looking fantastic in a cameo part.

The 2/3 of the movie that I saw was fast-paced and tense, intellectually and artistically pleasing, and well acted. I'll have to go back to see the rest of it. My grandson thinks he'll wait till it comes out in video and watch it on a small and less intimidating small screen.

UG! A Hulking mass of a BAD movie!,"Where should I begin? How about with THIS MOVIE BLOWS!!!!! I am a big Hulk fan and I knew that there would be no halfway with the new movie...I would either love it or hate it. Man, how I wish it had gone the other way!

Going in, I was worried about the CGI, but I was pleasantly surprised and truly thought the transitions between Bruce and Hulk were pretty smooth. That's pretty much all I can say nice, but against Miss Manners advice from so long ago, that's not all I'm going to say.

The two biggest problems were that the comic book style of the movie made me nuts, and all of the theorizing and talking about why Bruce became the Hulk threatened to put me to sleep. Somehow they managed to make a movie about the hulk boring! Now that takes talent! Yikes!

Now, I thought maybe I was just too old to appreciate it (since I am slightly out of the target market), but there were teens and tweens all around that were just as bored and irritated as I was. My advice? Don't bother! Just check to see if the old Lou Ferrigno version is in re-runs anywhere. Much better effects and acting!",,23 June 2003
"Doesn't dazzle, but doesn't fizzle either.","The Hulk is not a mediocre film, nor it does it top any list. It is a pleasing and entertaining film. The story is solid, the acting good and the direction adequate. The film has some great action sequences and memorable characters. I concede The Hulk was no effects masterpiece, but he wasn't an embarrassment to CGI either. Effects have been worse (remember the Red Skull in the 1990s Captain America?). Marvel Comics outdid themselves with Spider-Man. It will be hard to top that one. Spider Man will forever be remembered as a classic. The Hulk will be remembered as ""the movie Marvel Comics did after Spider Man."" Yes I know Dare Devil came after Spider Man, but it was quickly forgotten.",,22 June 2003
I think I'll bounce like Tigger!!!,"What a lame movie to have to go watch! I was fortunate to not have to wait in line at Universal to see it on opening night. I actually didn't have to pay, friends got free tickets! We saw a screening of it before anyone else did that night and I'm glad I didn't have to waste my energy fighting crowds to see such a bad movie.

First of all it was a bit dark like all comic books I guess, I'm not fond of comic superhero movies at all but my husband is and he is the reason I went. Not only was it about 2 hours too long but it was also ridiculous, I know it's not supposed to be realistic but it was worth laughing at. My best friend and I laughed at the serious and not so serious parts. The best part of the movie was seeing Bruce Banner's butt! Not that I'm a big fan of butt's it was just something out of that movie I will remember. When I got home that night about 30 minutes after we left the theater I couldn't even remember the actual ending to the film, that's a sad statement! But I would have to say the funniest part was the Hulk bounding across the mountains, that was such a joke! It reminded me of Tigger.

My summary, if you like comic books and CGI films, you'll probably like it. For the realists our there, it's a joke, if you have 2.5 hours to kill and need a laugh rent it, don't see it in the theater, because you can't get that time back, and why fight the crowds for a mediocre film!

A well-done comic book adaptation.,"I frankly don't understand the bad press this film has received. While it is certainly not a ""standard"" action/comic book movie, that's all to the good IMO. Director Ang Lee gives the story time to unfold before the action sequences take over - but the unique look and editing of the film help propel the story even before the Hulk shows up. I think criticism of the GGI work in the film is ludicrous. To say the Hulk doesn't look ""real"" is idiotic - he isn't real! He's a comic book character!! The question should be: does he act and move and look and leap and destroy things the way the comic book character does? The answer is- Yes. And he does so very convincingly. Final thought: If you're a Hulk fan, don't be discouraged by what you read about this film. Go see it and judge for yourself. I think you may be pleasantly surprised. [And Jennifer Connelly is mighty fine to watch in any case.]",,30 June 2003
"it was exciting, no reason to give a bad rep.","first off. I must respond to those who blindly hate comic book movies as dull and un-interesting. Someone said it was unoriginal, i believe that can't be said about this movie. While i didnt think the editing was very good it WAS original. No one has yet to attempt putting together a movie so much like a comic book, i didnt like it but it was original. second, the movie was basically all CG and that is very creative and it is a leap forward for it was good cg at that. Yes, at times you could tell that it was cg but some of it was GOOD!!! And if you couldnt recognize that...its sad. I mean if you saw the matrix you would realize that watching Neo fly or fight many agent smiths was ten times more painful and horribly done than this movie. It was exciting. I dont think some people realize that some movies are just for sheer enjoyment. The acting was crappy, the editing upset me but i walked out happy as hell.",,25 June 2003
The Hulk  13th July 2003  Most imaginative super hero film ever,"Yep, its true. Maybe I'm a sucker for the stylish split screens, or maybe I just like to see the Hulk jumping around canyons. This my friends, is one heck of a movie. Before it came out, most of the talk was about the CGI, namely that of the Hulk. Well, ILM have excelled themselves, in fact, the main player is all CGI and from the first minutes he's on there you sorta forget that. You believe he's a real character and there's lots of genuinely touching moments in this film. Interesting to see that most of the Humans in this movie are angry, adrenaline driven monsters whereas the Hulk is fairly timid. He just wants to get at those people who are attacking the ones he loves the most. A paradox that was evident in the TV show and one that's been successfully replicated in this movie. I loved the use of Split screens too. For once they were used in a movie and they actually made sense. It makes you believe you're watching a real life comic book. When the Hulk first makes his entrance I thought the action scenes were OK but thought maybe Ang Lee nailed the character side of the movie but the action might be sorely lacking. Mid Way through the genuinely terrifying dog scene those fears were quickly dispelled. This guy can do action and take it to the extreme. Anyone worrying that this film would have no humour and be 100% straight as a dye will have their worries dispelled toofrom a certain point of view. You see, this is the genius of this film. The humour is in the vein of The Royal Tennenbaums. It doesn't give you a musical cue to laugh, neither does the director throw a joke in your face. The scene where Banner has a table full of food was great. Also the scene where the Hulk is having it out in the desert and we see two army personnel duck. Not to mention the 'he's stole my rocket line' pure fun moments in the heat of battle. Superman The Movie for me is the perfect comic book film, its probably my favourite film of all time and whilst super heroes have been flying onto the big screen recently with an unrelenting ferocity STM is still on that pedestal high in the sky above all those pretenders. The closest are two films I love, Spiderman and the first X-Men. But now Ang Lee and ILM have crafted a film which is so good, its joined STM up there in the 'best super hero ever' movies pedestal that adjourns the comic book skyline. Whilst its not better its not far behind at all. Id prefer to see new movies based on The Hulk that's for sure.",,16 May 2004
Me like...,"Me Hulk like movie. Me Hulk happy... Hulk eats lots p'corn and Coke. Me Hulk thinks movie good. Me Hulk look very pretty on big screen. Hulk likes story. No Hollywood stuff to make Hulk mad. Me Hulk had good time. Me Hulk probably see Hulk movie again. Me Hulk thinks others see Hulk also. If no, Hulk pull legs off.

All appraisal of appraisement to Ang Lee!,"I can't consider it the best of characters that based from comics like a spider man , X-Men or others .... & about the music it was very good specially beside the special effects !

this movie should be loves from present generations as loved it the past generations ... who's knows the HULK well on the comics !

at last ... DON'T MISS IT !",,25 June 2003
Oh GOD when will it end!!!!,"To start I must say that is was great to see local boy Eric Bana making his name in Hollywood. Oh if you could see where he has come from ""Poita"" on our local sketch comedy show. Hard to believe he was originally a comedian, and a very funny one at that. On to the movie. I had been looking forward to this for so long, as I love my superhero movies. After the first half hour of the movie I fighting off the need to visit the men's room, adamant that i didn't want to miss anything. Alas! I could have gone anytime during the first hour and a half of the movie. How could it drag on so long?? Two and a half hours for for what was meant to be (and advertised as!!!) a comic book action movie is way way way too long. I almost fell asleep it was that damn boring! If you have seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon you would definitely know both these movies were directed by the same bloke. Did you hear the music?? Anyway, the action finally kicked in, and I don't think it was a disappointment. How awesome is the angry angry man??? Finally I was seeing what I had been waiting for. Destruction! I didn't think he looked as bad as some critics had made out. And to all those people out there complaining about his shorts! Get a life!!! It's a story about a guy who turns into a green colossus when he gets angry! It's not based on real life!!! OK so we finally got we were after, then thought that the movie had finally finished with the Hulk calming down to the charms of Betty, but Alas! the movie continues, culminating in and ending that left everyone in the cinema going ""WHAT??"". What the hell was the dillyo with the fight between Hulk and his old man? Maybe I did fall asleep here because I feel like I missed something. Now I'm really hanging for the sequel, cos i know it can;t be as boring without the build up this movie had. They better not stuff it up or I might get angry. And ""you wouldn't want to see me when I'm angry"".",,2 July 2003
Wonderful cinematography and clever directing but DUMB plot,"Ang Lee is an extremely talented director. His fast editing, jump cuts and multi-panelled screens make for exciting viewing - so much so that you don't notice the 2 hour 20 minute length of the film. However the plot is seriously nonsensical (and this deteriorates further as you get to the end of the movie). That flaw makes it quite a forgettable movie but nonetheless fairly entertaining whilst you are in the cinema. It's safe to take your other half and kids to go see it, they won't feel the time was unduly wasted. It's about time that this great director gets to sink his teeth into an equally great script.",,4 July 2003
This movie sucked,"Very rarely do I find myself at the movie theater looking at my watch, desparately wanting to leave but that's what happened when I went to see Hulk.

This film is way too long, there's not enough smashing, and the story was boring and uninvolving. There really isn't much you can do with this concept in the first place. The guy gets mad and then destroys stuff. He's not a hero so I can hardly root for him. Ang Lee really worked the father/son/repressed childhood memories angle. I never really bought into it. They shouldn't have tried so hard to make it a movie about something and just given us all the popcorn movie we wanted.

What a waste of time. I honestly think that if I hadn't been there with friends I would have left before it ended.",,21 June 2003
"If there's a sequel, let Bryan Singer do it!","Being a fan of the comic I had high expectations on this movie. I've enjoyed some of the recent comic-to-film movies, such as ""X-Men"", ""X-Men 2"" and ""Spiderman"". I also appreciated some of Ang Lee's earlier movies, specifically ""The Ice Storm"", so I was almost certain that ""The Hulk"" would at least have a good story to rely on.

Unfortunately the case was the opposite. The effects and action-sequenses were the only good things about the movie, while the plot was awful. Or maybe I should say ""lack of plot"" cause it doesn't happen much that you haven't figured out after the first 30 minutes. One of the main arguments in favour of ""The Hulk"" is that it's ""deep"" and more intelligent than other ""comic book movies"". Well, let me tell you something; slow pacing and *lots* of dialog don't necessarily equal depth. It may also equal little content and prentenciousness.

The first half hour of the movie consists of a prolog that explains all about Banners past. Instead of a radiation accident he is now created through genetic manipulation *combined* with a radiation accident. You see, Banners father *happened* to study in the exact same field of genetics that he does. Furthermore, Banners ex-girlfriend/colleague *happens* to be the daughter of the army general that put his father in prison. How is these remarkable coincidences explained you might ask. They aren't!

And why must the scientific explanation be updated? It's not like it's possible with genetic manipulation either, so why even bother. Who cares if the explanation is realistic or not? If you want realism you've picked the wrong movie.

After being spoon-fed the entire plot in the beginning of the movie we get to spend the last two hours watching how Banner finds out the same thing (he's pretty slow for a scientist). Every scene that doesn't contain action drags on and on. With dialogs and monologs and a whole heap of ""silent contemplation"". The focus of the story has been shifted from the Banner Vs. Hulk internal conflict to several irrelevant and utterly uninteresting sub-plots. Since this is a Hollywood movie we have the obligatory romantic sub-plot (yawn). As if that wasn't enough we also get to see how Banner's ex relates to her father and how Banner relates to his own father. Who cares?

The only good thing about ""The Hulk"" was the special effect scenes. They stood in sharp contrast to the rest of the movie, since they not only contained 99% of the humour, but also were well-made with good pacing. Some complains that they are ""over the top"", but that's the way Hulk is if you read the comics. There's no reason to change that.

Making a deeper, darker comic-movie is not impossible. It has been done before in ""The Crow"", but unlike ""The Hulk"", ""The Crow"" was based on a good script. If you want to see a good movie, go watch ""X-Men 2"" again. It's not deep, but hey, neither is ""The Hulk"".",,11 July 2003
"I liked it, so there.","I was a comic book fanatic during my teenage years, and The Incredible Hulk was one of my favorites. Something about the star-crossed Bruce Banner intrigued me; I read the Hulk comics faithfully, hoping to see the Hulk find some kind of peace, but it seemed it was nowhere to be found. Director Ang Lee's vision of the Hulk, though not entirely faithful to the comics (and it would be way too boring and predictable if it were, wouldn't it?), is a pretty good interpretation of the Marvel version of Jekyll & Hyde. The principle actors were great, especially Jennifer Connelly and Sam Elliott. This was the first time I remember seeing Eric Bana and I thought he pulled off the role well. As for the CG, I can see why the perfectionists would tear it apart, since the Hulk is obviously a CG image, but guess what? IT'S A MOVIE!!! THE HULK IS AN IMAGINARY CHARACTER!!!",,28 December 2003
IT'S BIG GREEN AND STINKS !!!,The story was terrible.The action was too little too late.It reminded me of sitting thru an old Godzilla movie (An hour of waiting for 10 minutes of action) I'll take the Hulk TV series any day over this drawn out piece of crap.What A waste of time and money.,,26 June 2003
Awful,"That's basically all I can think of to say... The Hulk was incredibly disappointing. Where Spiderman had plot, deep characters and a likeable protagonist, Hulk has bad SFX and no storyline at all, and the ""good guy?"" I saw nothing but an irritating growling chunk of greenness. It's as if the script-writers all sat down to have a meeting and said ""Ok, we have a giant green man. What should happen? Anything goes, guys, we have two hours to fill."" I think the only people who will like this movie are the die-hard Hulk comics readers, and possibly Special-Effects junkies. If you're looking for plot, real characters, or even a remotely entertaining film, chances are, you won't find it here.

Oh yeah, and what on earth was up with the opening credits? Chopping up a starfish, gassing monkeys, exploding frogs... my word, whose idea was that? I would say don't bring kids to this movie (WAY too scary) but if you do, DON'T let them watch the opening sequence.",,8 July 2003
It was alright.,"The Hulk was good for the special effects but so much time was wasted with scenes that could have been left out that it wasn't a great movie.

I would say about at least a half hour could be cut off this film or at least altered. But overall it was enjoyable to some degree because the Hulk looked so good. It was exciting during the action shots, and I thought those were exceptional.",,20 June 2003
Pathetic,,,21 June 2003
NOT the TV Hulk!,"First off I just want to say that this movie is not based on that lame-ass piece of feces television show with Bill Bixby as a social worker with anger issues. This is the comic book Hulk, the unstoppable behemoth who levels cities. Anyone expecting Banner to be helping retarded kids or teenage runaways will be sorely disappointed. Ang Lee should be commended for trying to make more of the material than was actually there. Unfortunately a lot of the backstory feels crammed in. The Hulk doesn't show up until halfway through the movie and then the movie picks up. His appearance isn't totally 'realistic' (whatever that means in a movie)but it worked nicely for me. His rampages are very exciting and true to his comic book abilities. Sam Elliot is terrific as General Ross, as is Jennifer Connely as Betty. I love Josh Lucas as a slimy villian and laughed when he got his comeuppance. The weak link is Bana as Banner. He underplays to the point of lifelessness.

A better movie than a lot of people say it is, it's just not what most people expected of a Hulk movie.",,27 October 2003
"True to the comic (sorta), but shouldn't have been a summer flick","I think one major mistake about the film was releasing it as a summer blockbuster. This wasn't one of those hyperactive action feel-good movies like ""Spider-Man."" This was a science-fiction drama/tragedy, but was marketed and hyped like the former. Anyone who was expecting to have a lotta laughs like Spider-Man would be disappointed. They should have released it in the fall or winter. The marketing was overboard as well. The studios made a lot of bad decisions regarding that.

The Hulk was never meant to be a ""superhero"" film. More like a Godzilla film with more depth. As a comic collector, I can say that in many ways the film was true to the comic. The self-centered insanity of Bruce's father, his mother's death at the hands of her husband, Bruce's sacrifice to save a colleague (the gamma accident), Talbot's obsession leading to his death, etc.

I appreciate Ang Lee's interpretation of the Hulk (the CGI Hulk looked good to me). The Hulk has always been the id of Bruce Banner and doesn't have much personality or vocabulary of his own. If there is a sequel, the events of the ending may give the Hulk more dialogue and personality. In retrospect, I think the other characters were done well, true to the comic. Only Nick Nolte, though, seems to have stretched it and become the standout in the film.

So, either you love it or hate it. Those that hate it I think only know the Hulk from the TV series, and I heard of one comment exclaiming it's ""nothing like the TV show."" That irks me, 'cause the TV show is almost nothing like the comic, and I don't just mean they didn't have a big enough budget for more accurate FX. Watch the UPN cartoon on ABC Family. The first season was awesome, the second was lousy, though.",,27 July 2003

Pretty Psychedelic,"I just got some new speakers and the only thing I had to test them out with is the DVD of Hulk and I've watched it several times now. Wow! The non-stop roller coaster ride of imagery and sounds (explosions, sound effects and music w/Middle-eastern drones and drums) just gets going and doesn't let up. The sequence beginning with the escape from liquid detention in the secret underground Army base and ending as he rides the jet into outer space and then fa-a-alls back to earth (including the dream/hallucination of ""Puny human!"") has got to be one of the great audio/visual sequences of all time. Don't let the nit-pickers and nay-sayers dissuade you...

There's some sort of raging-third-world metaphor at play in this sequence if you go in for that kind of thing but the whole movie has a lot more depth than anything Bryan Singer ever made.",,15 January 2007
Not impressed,"Granted i am not a comic book fan, i found spiderman and the x-men renditions highly enjoyable so decided to try it out. This however was anything but enjoyable. With a storyline that could potentially be even more confusing than the matrix with there being dreams and visions every 5 minutes, it's English 12 rating could be a big mistake. The special effects at times are awsome, the hulk has been captured brillantly in most scenes. However two clitches i saw were absolutely pathetic. At one stage the hulk only had half of his purple shorts on, and when he was emerging from some rocks he looked like a poor video clip from a ps one game, yes it was that bad!!

If you are a fan of the comic, by all means go see it. If you found spiderman to be a treat wait until you can rent it out for next to nothing atleast, but do not spend your hard(or not) earned money on it!

"I'm not vivid, but this was AWFUL","I don't know if I'll get around to writing my scathing review of how much I disliked HULK, so I'll make a few points.

HULK is the worst film that I have paid money to see this year. It was too long, needed a lot of unnecessary scenes and characters removed, lacked a truly menacing villain, had boring characters developed not to mention dull performances, the film took itself too seriously, it became unintentionally funny SEVERAL times and the CGI hulk looked bad.",,21 June 2003
Not bad but not great,"Hulk is neither the thinking man's blockbuster that Ang Lee wanted it to be, nor the dull piece of trash that many critics and cinema-goers labelled it as. Instead it's just another comic book flick, albeit one that has a little bit more story and a little less action than most. (A balance I'm perfectly happy with.)

One of things that most people bring up is that they don't like the CGI Hulk. Well, it's not perfect and the results are variable (sometimes the Hulk can look convincing, at other times it's faker than the shark in Jaws), but personally I find it preferable to a bodybuilder in a bad wig painted green who communicates his rage by flexing his muscles. The TV Hulk was ridiculous.

Another complaint is that it's too slow. Perhaps it's because I watch far too many films, and some obscure ones at that, but the pacing didn't bother me. I thought the build up to the Hulk's appearance was well timed. But then again, I think that most modern films are too impatient. Therefore I like it when a film isn't in a rush.

People also complained that the film was too humourless. Well, I can't really see much potential for laughs in a film when a boy is being tested on by his father and when the man he grows up to be is consumed by rage. Wisecracks and jokes would kind of undermine the mood. Having said that, Nolte's grandstanding is rather comic, as is Josh Lucas' villain. But for me, those aren't positives. Nolte's performance is too exaggerated (and he's got the same haircut that he so wonderfully displayed in his mug shot) and Lucas grates as a consummate dick.

Yet another complaint in some quarters was that there wasn't enough action. I think there's plenty. And I think it's well done. I think the tank sequence is excellent, as is the fight with the helicopters. But the fight with the tank contains the best CGI in the movie. The Hulk looks his most convincing in the moments where he's pushing a tank over and where he's battering another with a large barrel. The animation is superb. And I also like the way the Hulk leaps across the landscape. It certainly gets it away from the mundane TV series. But while I like that action sequence, I think the monster mash that finishes the film is rather lacklustre. It's just too artificial and impersonal. The sequence with the military is more engaging because it's set in some sort of 'reality' and because it's emotionally engaging  you just want them to leave the poor guy alone. But visually the final sequence is just a computer graphics demonstration, and in terms of narrative it's there just to tie up loose ends.

Another action scene that falls a little flat is the one with the mutant dogs. Again it's just a bit silly. Sure it's fun to see the Hulk destroy things, but it feels like it's there because Lee is obligated to give the audience some action. It's entirely superfluous and again it's a sequence that is too fake to be enjoyed simply as mindless action.

But although some of the action is mindless, the film does try to be more thoughtful than most comic book films. And in this regard it works. Personally I find a lot of comic book films tiresome because the hero is always invulnerable and because he always has to go against some absurd supervillian. It's always the same story. In Hulk, though, the character's biggest enemy is himself. And although he's invulnerable, his powers are more of a curse that a gift. I mean, as much as I like the Spider-Man films, Peter Parker doesn't really have it that bad, does he? He may have the odd supervillian to deal with, but his biggest problem is that he can't get 'MJ'. In the grand scheme of things it's pretty banal. But the Hulk has it much worse and therefore I find him more interesting. He's kind of like every man. He's continually being nagged by women, bossed around by employers and under the surface is a lot of repressed anger. He's someone we can relate to. But the only difference is that the Hulk gets to live out our fantasies. He gets to completely lose it. And as he says, ""When I totally lose control, I like it.""

But there are consequences to that. As a result of his curse, he's not able to make lasting connections. He's frightened that he'll hurt those closest to him (in the TV series this would be the cue for some sad piano music and Banner walking along a dirt-covered road trying to thumb a lift). So, therefore, I find him a more sympathetic comic book character than most.

Less sympathetic is Betty (played by Jennifer Connelly). I found her an incredible nag. At the beginning she's always harassing Bruce, trying to reveal hidden depths to his character. Women always want more. They always want to be the one to uncover some hidden dimension. So it's not surprising that what's under the surface is a lot of anger. But she also probes into his past, uncovering upsetting memories. I can't help but think that he would have been better off if she'd just left him alone. But what they both share are strained relationships with their fathers. This is one of things that is best executed. The action is enjoyable noise but the story at the core of the film shows that we're all products of our upbringing. We are what we are because of other people and DNA. We have less control than we think. For some of us, if we're lucky, things work out well, but for others they don't. I guess if you're turning into a big green monster you're one of the unlucky ones.",,23 September 2005
Not 100% percent,"I can honestly see how Ang Lee TRIED to make this film unique (cinematography, editing style, character-driven, etc), and not like every other Marvel comic book hero brought to the big screen.

But unfortunately, he didn't succeed. It may have been the fake-looking GREEN of The Hulk, or possibly Eric Bana's strong attempt at keeping an American accent (meanwhile forgetting how to act). Eric Bana was great in Chopper. However, that American accent is nothing short of ridiculous.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic as per usual, as is Nick Nolte.

I think to myself, could a story like this ever REALLY be brought to life, and feel realistic/believable? I know I enjoyed other comic book-based movies, such as X-Men and X-Men II.

I loved ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", but ""The Hulk"" has fallen short of the mark, and for that reason, I give it a 6/10.",,29 June 2003

Whoa! Way too harsh!,"Why you gotta be so harsh? You were expecting Citizen Kane? What do you expect from a director trying to turn a comic-book movie into the next Spiderman? Stan Lee's The Incredible Hulk never had the exposure that Stan Lee's The Incredible Spiderman had. It corresponds easily to the movie-screen. While it's nice to see a movie that panders to the male desire of destruction and mayhem, i'm sorry Ang Lee couldn't bring in Tom Hanks or Denzel Washington or the acting prowess they have.

You know, it might be for the best that this movie played out the way it did. How would you expect the Hulk, who at this point in his incarnation was a completely mindless freak of nature and science anyway, to act. The entire thing HAD to be a CGI spree of destruction. That's the only way the Savage Hulk would have it.

Stop being so critical. Save that for The Punisher.",,22 June 2003
"Too complex, but still fun to watch.","While this most recent Marvel attack to Hollywood bears little similarity to the comic book story besides the original concept, it is quite ingenious and self-sufficient. Thanks to Ang Lee for that. Frankly, what entertained me most is the split-screen cinematography, clearly pointing out its comic book origin and adding a new flavor to modern action flicks. Virtually there's no villain from the book, stating there will be sequels to come. It also brings Eric Bana into limelight, whose name, I admit, I never heard before.

Besides Bana, it was nice to watch Jennifer Connelly and Nick Nolte, both of whom performed very well, mixing art to this all-tech creation. The screenplay was not satisfactory though. And the story got somehow messy in the end. I believe the movie could have ended long ago, you know what I mean.",,5 July 2003
Not as bad as I expected.,"I'm into the new comic movies as much as any other nerd who can't grow up, but to me The Hulk just didn't catch my eye the same way the other movies of the same genre have, i.e. Spider-Man & X-Men(Daredevil i'm still not sure of). But seeing the hulk in his computer animated glory during one of the trailers made me wonder if this movie would be worth my $8. The first thing i noticed was the comic book style of shots, which in my opinion was a great way to tell a comic book story on the big screen. Second was the fact that Eric Bana isn't the best actor i've seen lately(although Bana's performance far exceded Paul Walker in 2fast 2furious, which i'm wishing i would have shot myself in the foot instead of seeing). But then here comes the HULK, all big, and green, and not real, which actually turned out looking better than expected, when hulk smash wall, wall fall down, and looks real at the same time. All in all, i rated the hulk a 7 not because of story or plot or acting, but because the big fight scene with the army is pretty badass.",,24 June 2003
Hulking good time,"This movie rocks. First off, people don't realize that the Hulk DOESN'T HAVE ANY HUMANITY. That is why he doesn't say anything, and that's why he destroys stuff. Also, why are people spending their time talking about his stretching pants? It's a movie based on a comic book.

The movie itself is awesome. The special effects here are the new standard, and has shown us what the new generations of CGI can bring us. The plot is good, and the characters, while over the top, were meant to be that way. If you are more into realism and don't like very far out movies, the Hulk is not for you. The Hulk is not going to be as fun as some other super hero movies, but the plot is by far the most unique. Besides, how cool was it to see the Hulk beat the crap out of those dogs?",,20 June 2003
Nice!,"The Hulk was exactly what i expected- a visually superior comic movie which is viewable if you know nothing or everything about the characters.

The special effects are great, and camera work is an innovative comic book style, which is interesting and exciting to watch.

Even my girlfriend, (who hates the movies in general and doesn't care for action movies) was impressed, and thorougly enjoyed this movie.

Don't listen to hyper-critics who are unable to correctly accept or grasp the concept and/or intent of The Hulk- it's definatley enjoyable by the vast majority of teatre-goers, and is WORTH the money spent to see it.

All in all, a great movie, which should be viewed on the big screen if you're able to.",,20 June 2003
Talky and boring.,"The only thing decent about this movie, ""The Hulk"", were the special effects. I think they did a fine job with Ol' Green skin himself however:

That does NOT excuse an unusually tedious, talky and just generally boring script.

I don't mind that movie makers update our beloved comic book characters to fit into the 21st Century way of thinking but when they take drastic liberties with a character such as they did with The Hulk and his *boo hoo* abusive childhood to the point of hardly recognizing the character's original origin, that shows a lack of interest in the personage himself and in movie-making in general.

When the industry made ""Spider-man"" they did a fine job in updating the legend to our now conventional standards but in the case of ""Hulk""...gawd what drivel!! It was as though Hulky was an entirely different character.

I read somewhere that Ang Lee (the director) was not necessarily interested in the character (Hulk) from the comic book, it shows.

The perfomances? Dry to non-essential.

The usually sparkling and beautiful Jennifer Connelly who is always a pleasure to see gave no more than a walk-on performance simply wondering around teary eyed muttering things like ""oh Bruce"" ?? Is this the same actress that won the esteemed Oscar a year or so ago?

There was nothing outstanding about this movie. Hulk's only remotely interesting quality were the special effects and as many true Sci. Fi./action buffs have solidly known for years from seeing the recent ""Star Wars"" travesties, that alone does NOT a fine motion picture make.

Please guys...NO ""Hulk 2"".

Nuff said.",,11 August 2003
You can't be serious Mr. Lee,"Having a more artsy director do a film about a much beloved comic book character was probably not the best idea. This film felt pretentious and was extremely boring. How can a Hulk film be boring? Have Ang Lee direct it of course and pretend to make it an extremely deep tragedy. It wasn't the actors fault, just about everyone is fantastic in most any film they are in from Jennifer Connelly to the mustache himself, Sam Elliot. This gargantuan waste of a film is all Ang Lee's fault. The man had one good movie, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and then got such an inflated head that he went on to make boring movies centered in controversy his bread and butter. It is sad really, because Industrial Light and Magic did a terrific job on the creation and look of the Hulk, only to have it surrounded by drivel.

Maybe not the best comic book adaption but the best movie about a comic book hero.,Wow. what a deep complex aproach to a character. So many levels. Fine writing and a unique vision. A true underrated masterpiece. Seems to me as if more action movies were like this i would watch them more. The really intelligent psychology in this screenplay as the driving force of the main character is resolved in the end is very unique in this kind of genre. Not that it doesn't exist in other comic book adaptations but neither have I've seen such subtleness and deepness in showing it. Sad that it performed so badly at the box office. Spider-Man is not as good as movie itself than this one. It may be a better adaptation though but as a movie itself it lies far behind The Hulk.,,11 December 2003
Gamma-irradiated repression,"On a list of summer blockbusters, most of them comic-book inspired, comes a movie like Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" and restores our faith in cinema, heals wounds inflicted from watching other pointless waste of capital.

The almost archetypal characters, with their human imperfections, turn this film into a Greek tragedy. Human emotions, from the earliest documents thru history, haven't changed. Conflict turns on coping mechanisms; coping can manifest itself in forms of suppression, repression, or denial; and these manifestations result in anger, rage; which, in turn, materializes in un-controlled behaviour. Successfully characterizing the human nature in all of us, ""The Hulk"" adds to it other human themes of fraternal rivalry (almost to the point of involving the infamous Oedipus character), man's quest in conquering nature, man's awakening from superstition and fear-based religions and rituals, topping it all off with the probably most instinctual behaviour called ""GREED"", not to mention ""THE POWER OF LOVE"". The strength of this film, with its character oriented plot outline, is taken further into realms of successful cinema by Ang Lee's visual style involving split screen, dissolve connections, and really impressive visual effects. Long time collaboration between director Ang Lee, and composer Michael Danna had to end here after executives didn't like what Danna did. So, Danny Elfman comes in and scores the film. He does, however, retain some original ideas from Danna's approach (such as the ""Mother Theme"" which is sung by Natacha Atlas, and played on an Armenian duduk). Ang Lee was interested in retaining a lot of middle eastern and indian musical influences (especially obvious when the military are out in the desert) which Elfman didn't have a problem with either. Although, I must say, it does sound a bit awkward hearing ethnic music when the army is in some desert. Just when you think they're in Iraq, you see the ice cream shop and realize that this is good old Americana for you. Cinematography uses some interesting approaches, to the point where during the slightest shades of green in a scene with Bruce you get worried that he is turning into that uncontrolable monster one more time. The lighting on the CGI-created Hulk is very impressive and realistic (often a quality that, when incorrect, causes CGI creatures to look shiny and un-realistic). Performances are well done. It's surprising how Eric Bana almost looks like Christopher Reeves in some side-profile shots (especially with the nose). Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this well made film. And in all the latest comic book superhero films ""The Hulk"" is my favorite.",,24 July 2003
CGI champion paired with a difficult sell for movie go-ers,"In the first 10 minutes of movie I thought a few things:

Ang Lee wanted a very adult setting for the Hulk - ""When do I get to see the freaking Hulk?"" :^)


Basically, Lee had a tough job. He took several accomplished actors and put them into a bubble gum flick with mixed results. The CGI rocked. A little overdone at times...but what a pleasure to see the true Hulk ""in the flesh"". I couldn't get enough of him.

Lee had to somehow make the show interesting knowing that we couldn't see the Hulk the whole movie. And that's not easy. Especially with a younger audience. My kids and I were fascinated during the smash scenes, and barely hanging on during the rest.

I guess I'm making excuses for Lee, but the bottom line is that it's tough to incorporate a monster (unlike ""normal"" mutants) at just the right level. Too much and you've got a lot of cheese, too little and you've got a drama with flashes of excitement. I'd say this movie is the latter. Still a good movie. Still worth the watch.

If I could re-do it, I would mix in a mutant villian early on to keep things interesting (I know..that's not original) and I would have had more laughs. A 30-foot green dude could provide a lot of material given the chance. Bana isn't the charmer that MacGuire (for example) is, either. In the end, you get two types of movies (fantasy, drama) that aren't mixed for the best result. I still give it a 7.5 for the Incredible effects and Jennifer Connelly. Man, she's just sweet.",,21 June 2003
TERRIBLE!!!,"I was looking for a good movie to see I fell into the trap of seeing this boring film where the good parts when THE HULK jumps from Mountain to Mountain. And huge HULK dogs attack so bewareif you want to see something a train reck rent this!

Movies I would reccomend:Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship, The Lord of the Rings:the Two Towers, How to Deal, Legally Blond 2, Pirates of the CArribean, League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen, X-Men2, Finding Nemo, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

Movies I would not reccomend: The Hulk, Bringing Down the House",,20 July 2003
I'm getting very anglee!,"I'm not sure anyone could have made a serious film of this story and made it a success, after all it's about a man who when he gets angry turns into a giant and goes green. How could anyone possibly take that seriously. I admire Ang Lee for giving it a go but by the end you really wished he hadn't bothered. The first 45 mins is quite interesting as it sets the story up but unfortunately the story doesn't warrant such a thought provoking build up as to be honest there isn't really any story to speak of. In trying not to make just an action film they've made half a decent drama and half a terrible action film. It would have been better to have just made a good action film. Some of the acting and dialogue especially from Nolte is very funny but it's not suppose to be as there is no intentional humour in this film. The film takes itself so seriously that in the end the whole thing just seems ridiculous and very bad. (3/10)",,29 July 2003
Brilliant!...only kidding.,"Ang Lee's attempt to transpose the hit marvel comic onto the big screen is better than previous iterations, but still ends in failure. It seems it's only raison d'etre is too satisfy hardcore fans of the character, which Lee attempts by using a (far too comical)CG monster to retain the over-the-top nature of it's origins. Meanwhile, the rest of us are held at armslength by two-dimensional characters and an incomprehensible plot (the ending is one of the most puzzling in recent cinema history). The only excitement generated comes when the computer images get busy destroying some (pretty drab) scenery, the rest of the film is purely lethargic.",,18 September 2003
Completely intriguing and compelling,"Ang Lee's Hulk is certainly not a mindless action film, which is a good thing. The film has certainly sparked up a lot of criticism for being perhaps way too cerebral for a Hulk film. However, I am surprised by all of the negativity, simply because Hulk is not boring at all.

The characters in the film are strong, the dialogue is also pretty strong, the performances are solid (except Sam Elliot, who is just amazing). The film takes it's time letting the audience figure out these characters, and even though it does have dialogue, it is not nearly as slow as most make it out to be. The final transformation to the Hulk is pretty spellbinding, and even though the effects are outdated, I found them to be pretty remarkable. The action scenes, especially the end one, are also engaging, and I am surprised Lee could actually direct them.

Overall, Ang Lee's Hulk is not bad at all, and it does achieve some sort of greatness. Way better than the still enjoyable, but definitely mindless 2008 version. I still cannot believe that all of these years have passed and this Hulk has still not gotten the credit it deserves.",,17 October 2010
Comic-book fun though fanboys will be restless...,"Having only seen Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""The Ice Storm"", I didn't know quite how such a drama- and emotion-driven director would cope with the comic book story of The Hulk. I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. He handles the transition from comic page to film screen with great aplomb, and the 2hr15 running time just flew by for me.

I understand that the film-makers tinkered with the creation of 'The Hulk' and possibly other things such as costumes/ relationships/ side-stories may not be accurate when compared to the comics but all in all it's just an exciting, beautifully told story of one man and his monstrous alter-ego. And boy, what an alter-ego!

The days of CG have come pretty far - he conveys emotions like a real human, his hair sways in the light breeze on the hills of San Francisco, and you can really feel the THUDS as he leaps his way across the desert.

I thought the fx were excellent. I mean - what are you gonna base its realism on?!?! Great action scenes, convincing drama, Hulk destruction, and Nick Nolte hamming it up marvellously.

What more could you want?

8/10.",,25 July 2003
it impressed me 2 thing!!,These movie supposed to be great but Ang Lee want makes something different that he(Ang Lee) don't want people see this movie as the characters in the comic book so he make his own version of the HULK. And this are a weird part when i see this movie it likes reading a comics book the screen is like moving from this part to another part and once there are a part that really annoying first the camera zoom in and then zoom out it's to much zoom. it not a bad movie and when i watch this movie it impresses me 2 thing 1) the CGI was really great it looks real 2) Jennifer Connely look very good in this movie i give this movie 5/10,,30 June 2003
Patience needed for this 2 hour superhero film,"Despite being only 5 years apart from the 2008 version, this one doesn't age well despite having decent cast and great director, it felt like a film made in the 90s. Some of the villain / hulk dialogue and reactions are meme worthy and kinda unintentionally comical. If you have no patience and only want to see action you'll probably tune out often when it cuts to microscopic things and patterns. I like that it doesn't shy away from showing hulk so openly in broad daylight and he looked good, more human than other hulks. The editing is quite jarring in presentation with the split scenes / comic panels and to be honest while effective, that does not age well either. General Ross is much better represented here though and there are some beautiful action sequences in daylight but also long action scenes at night which is more difficult to stay focused on.",,22 January 2024
So disappointed,"This movie did not follow the traditional script guidelines and so we have to wait nearly 40 minutes before we see The Hulk. Not only that the film is so incredibly long.

The scene that occurs near the end between the father and his son totally confused me. I don't see what any of it had to do with the story, and the whole series of shots just confused me.

Sorry for the general comments, but I don't want to spoil anything.

The directing was good and the cast was okay. The film was a letdown compared to the trailers I saw. Anyways, just my thoughts...",,13 July 2003
Green with something... and it aint envy!,"What a pretty film. It definitely does live up to the life of a Comic Book spin-off... and I think Ang Lee has done the best he can with Hulk... so that the movie is good... and not overly 'green', which would be annoying and crash at the box office.

I liked this flick, it was a good one to go and see and I think that many other people out there will agree with me. I may even buy this one on DVD when it is released. Who knows, perhaps I have found the inner me in this movie... a great big, green, screetching nutter that would love to beat the stuffing out of the things that annoy him.... oh IF ONLY!!!

THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN!,"I thought the movie was brilliant,I thought it was better than Spiderman,X-Men and Daredevil. It even made me an actual Hulk fan. The only thing I would say that the movie could be improved in my opinion would be to have a bit of more violence in it, the bit where he smashed up them mutant dogs and ripped them apart was good, it would be good if he picked up some soldiers and slammed them in to the ground just like on the videogame for PS2 and X-BOX. I would give this movie 9 out of 10. I would look forward to a sequel.",,11 December 2003
"An insightful think-piece about a being of blind, unthinking rage.....","Okay. I understand why some people are disappointed with this film. These are the same people who rah-rah Jerry Bruckheimer films. And, while I have nothing against films that can be summed up with ""Crash! KABOOM! or BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! DIE SCUMBAG!"", this film isn't one of them.

For Bob's sake. This is Ang Lee. The director of Eat Drink, Man Woman. And Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. His films are ALL think-pieces. And they all have a great deal that is conveyed without needed to break into explosion-filled scenes ever other second or so.

Okay. Enough of my ranting at Hulk-haters.

Personally, I feel this is one of the best, and most serious treatments of the comic book genre that I've ever had the privilege of seeing.

Most of the Superman films, while somewhat serious, had their tongue planted firmly in their cheeks. Ditto for the first two Batman flicks (the later ones were just camp, plain and simple).

The X-Men films tended to be fairly good. But, because of the ensemble nature of the material, sub-plots tended to water down the story a bit.

Spider-Man was quite good actually, though it (as was the comic book that spawned it) was focused entirely on a ""kid"" who actually found his powers ""cool"", even if they WERE somewhat inconvenient.

The Hulk doesn't have that. Inflating into a 15' tall, bright green behemoth isn't exactly as easy to hide as the fact that you can scale walls without a rope. Plus there's the duality of the simultaneous acquisition and loss of control implicit in the Hulk (can do pretty much whatever he wants, but has no mental/emotional grounding to prevent him from doing LITERALLY ""anything"" (caber-tossing a tank might sound fun, unless you're the poor so-and-so in the drivers seat of the now-airborne hunk of steel).

All in all, I think this was an EXCELLENT film. Maybe not an excellent ""action film"". But it was an excellent film nonetheless.

My summary says it all.",,29 June 2003
Hulk smash!,"It'd be very easy to dismiss this film as yet another in the current slew of Marvel cash-ins, which was already starting to get tedious with the release of Daredevil. But this film, thankfully, has something more to offer. Ang Lee has made that extra effort to go beyond having a film based on a comic book to blurring the line between the two. And a damn fine job he did too. It wasn't perfect, as the use of panels within the film got a bit annoying after a while, but no-one can deny it was inventive. You actually feel that you are in the comic book rather than a film and all of a sudden, suspending your disbelief becomes that much easier. All the comic book cliches and the fact that you have a big green CGI character somehow seem natural and you start enjoying yourself that much more. The cartoon violence deserves a special mention. Thankfully, the filmmakers didn't succum to overplaying it. As an example. in one part, they could have had the Hulk taking on an entire armoured devision at once but instead, they just have him tearing apart four tanks. The brutal simplicity of it had me jumping out of my seat. Top stuff. There's an attempt to inject a little bit of depth and it isn't completely wasted, thanks mainly to Jennifer Connelly's sterling performance. Although it has to be said the whole father sub-plot just gets annoying after a while. To sum up, this is a hugely enjoyable film, despite the fact that the ending doesn't maintain the momentum generated earlier. However, it is aimed squarely at the comic book crowd and most people outside this probably need not apply. Everyone else will probably leave with a smile on their faces.",,22 July 2003
"Why, Ang, WHY?!?!","(!!!!!!!WARNING: I do not explicitly give away plot details in this review, but I do allude to certain aspects of the film that some may want to remain a mystery. If you don't want to take your chances, check out something else. If you've seen it, though, and want a second-opinion, check it out. You've been warned.!!!!!!!)

I would first like to say that I am a huge Ang Lee fan. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" has long been one of my favorite films, both for its high-flying action and its beautiful storytelling and cinematography.

However, this has got to be one of the most disappointing encores any director has ever turned out. Marvel has done a superb job adapting its books to film thus far, but between a dull story, less-than-impressive performances by Connelly and Bana, and editing that gets old 1/4 of the way through the film (especially to anyone who's seen an episode of ""24""), this film is a major disappointment. Even the credit sequences for all the Marvel films are starting to look the same. This was more like a bizarre retelling of ""King Kong"". About the only bright spots worth noting are that 1) it does tackle the superhero origin story from a refreshingly different angle, 2) an outstanding performance by Nick Nolte, and 3) yes, the CGI is pretty good.....although I don't remember the Hulk being that agile or having healing abilities. The build up to the final revelation of what happened to Banner's mother grows extremely tedious extremely quickly. The ending, though cute, is all too predictable and screams ""sequel"". By the end, I couldn't tell if I should be begging for Marvel to bring the Fantastic Four to the big screen, or praying that we're nearing the end of this tedious string of crossover franchises. This movie, though a decent rental someday, is not worth your $6.50.",,2 July 2003
Hulk Speaks,"Hulk very happy when he hear man who made martial art film into beautiful and graceful movie goin' to make story about Hulk. But when Hulk see movie, Hulk very sad. Why script so stupid? Why people say stupid simple things like they in some cheap TV movie? And Man and girl, he very good in other film and she won Oscar, but why in my film they look like they can't act. Why man who play Hulk father look like he just been arrested for drunken driving, and how he get money to build very expensive lab in back shed and create giant killer dogs. Hulk thinks he must have very tolerant neighbours.

Hulk do think line about girl saved from `Mutant French Poodle', funniest line since last press conference by President, but why no more jokes? Hulk think they all take it far too serious.

Most of all Hulk very sad. Because film so rubbish, no chance of more Hulk films. Hulk stay very poor. Hulk need lots of money for clothesIn fact Hulk starting to get very ANGRY!!!! HULK SMASH!!!!!",,10 May 2004

Cool comic book movie!,"While not quite as entertaining as it should have been, I've always loved comic books and The Hulk and thought at many times in the movie that it captured the comic book feel and delivered special effects, not while not completely believable, had an other-worldly feel to it and the atmosphere and action sequences in the movie are cool. The battle in the end between The Hulk and The Absorbing Man was my favorite part as it had the feeling of the comics and cartoons and also reminded me of say Godzilla, King Kong etc., and I wish they had more of that.",,22 June 2003
Made for the 70's generation of fans,"As a young girl in the early 70's I would sneak into my brother's bedroom and avidly read his Marvel comics. I say this because I felt that Hulk was made for that generation of movie goers who have matured enough to understand the depth of this film and why it isn't as shallow as other comic book based movies (X men excepted). Having said that, I was accompanied by my 12 year old daughter, who enjoyed much of it, but, found some of it a bit over her head. As for myself I enjoyed it, the CGI Hulk was excellent and his clever characterisation made you completely sympathise with the Hulk, so much so that when he was pursued by the military I was thinking to myself ""Leave him alone!"". The cast was superb, though Eric Bana perhaps just lacked the screen charisma of, say, Hugh Jackman. Sam Elliot, as always, was very solid, as was Nick Nolte. All I can say is that when you go to see this movie don't leave your brain at home and I have to disagree with one reviewer who said it was the worst film he ever saw. Really? Then you don't go to the movies that much , and to the other who walked out, bad luck, because if you had stuck with it then you would have been rewarded.",,14 July 2003
A giant green waste of time,"If ""hulk"" also refers to a once great ship now drifting uselessly, rotten and leaky, then it fits this movie well. As many viewers have pointed out, the sequences when the jolly green giant actually appears are magic. They are full of superb action, humor and wit. The characterisation of the Hulk is sensitive and complex - more than can be said of performances by human actors. The problem is that these three sequences make up about 15 minutes in the whole 2 hour+ movie. The rest is taken up with the most boring, meanderine, illogical, irrelevant drama, conveyed by often laughably bad dialogue and acting, that I have seen in any movie for a long time, let alone a comic-book action-flick. The plot requires us to make Hulk-sized credibility leaps. Are we to believe that never in 30 years did Bruce once get angry and wonder why his skin turned mottled green? Or that he just coincidentally ends up in love with the daughter of the Gruff Authoritarian Army Officer who arrested his father. Or that a guy can be thrown through a window, across a street, bounced off a police car and then thrown another forty feet onto onto a concrete road and turn up three scenes later with a just sling on his arm? And when said GAAO declares that Bruce must be locked up because he is danger to society how come in the next scene Daughter is taking Bruce on a tour of his old house out in the desert without a guard in sight? None of this seems to worry Ang Lee who would rather pan his camera over some driftwood or a patch of lichen than cut thirty minutes of out of this tedious script. One can only hope that a HULK II will be produced which is 80% Hulk and 20% Banner, instead of the 5/95 ratio we have in this mess. And Ang Lee should never be allowed near a popcorn movie again. Possibly any movie.",,10 July 2003
Great Effects,"At first I did not think I was going to like the CGI effects but the movie as a whole was really good. I also liked the cameo by Lou Forigno (not sure of the spelling). I like many others enjoyed the T.V. series of the Hulk. I never read the comics on the Hulk but I still enjoyed the movie very much. All the action scenes were perfectly done. My seven year old and I walked out of the theater satisfied. I will be buying the DVD when it comes out. Another Marvel movie classic. I recommend this movie to everyone, it's great!",,23 June 2003
Thinking man's comic book adaptation,"With due respect to all those who felt let down by the hulk, perhaps they were expecting another popcorn entertainer about an all too familiar comic book character and his alter ego with just enough camp and tongue in cheek humor to let us know the genre.

Well, with Ang 'Sense and Sensibility' Lee helming, they really ought to have known what to look for.Lee's characterizations are his strongest point and these characters are fleshed out with a depth seldom seen in comic book adaptations where the intent is to quickly establish the backstory/origin and get on with the action.

Eric Bana is an inspired choice for a brooding and complicated Bruce Banner while Connelly sparkles as always in the role of Betty Ross.

Changes to the origin don't bother me too much even if I am a big comic book afficionado, primarily because as long as the chracterization remains faithful, I would condone other changes as creative license.

The farther-son 'greek tragedy' is well established and explored, except perhaps some scenes are too disturbing for an younger audience.

But the overall vibe one gets from the animated Hulk in the later scenes is that of a simple childlike creature that has been wronged a la King Kong.

To me, that has also always been the Hulk for me and that's why I liked the movie.",,21 June 2003
Bad,"I watched this movie alone, maybe this is why I hated it. However, I still hate it.

I loved Ang Lee in CT&HD, that movie was an amazing combination of aesthetics and fun. I even did not laugh in the flight scenes when rest of the theatre was laughing..

HOWEVER, Hulk is supposed to be a movie for fun. This is the reason for the existence of comics. If I wait the guy to be Hulk for an hour, or I am drowned into the psychological bullshit, then I feel that I am not having fun.. As someone expecting to have fun after this particular movie for apparent reasons, I hated it due to what it made me deprived of. FUN! -except for 20 minutes..

I respect Ang Lee.. I like sophisticated movies.. But when I go to the theatre for fun, I need to get it. This is an comics adaptation and so it should not be so serious. ( I can handle that seriousness in an another movie not having a green ogre throwing tanks)",,3 July 2005
Not as good as the Television Series!,"I watched this film with high expectations, and i have to say its not a type of film you can watch over and over again. The picture just didnt move me, sure there was mind blowing special effects but that's not what makes a film great. I know many people will disagree with this, but I think the Pilot episode of the 'Incredible Hulk' (which aired in 1977) delivers far better than this for many reasons. First of all, i was against the idea of the digital hulk from the start, because no matter how hard you try it never looks 100% real. What they should've done is got an actor to play the Hulk and enlarge him digitally against the backgroud so he looks bigger, adding a far mose sense of realism! Although i appreciate the fact that Ang Lee's team worked hard to bring the hulk to life, the end result just wasn't worth it because the trousers looked too plastic with no tear marks, and it was just purple straight out of a bottle! Sure the Hulk in the television series wasn't huge, but at least it was real and authentic, the idea of 'white eyes' worked because it have the audience an indication of 'point of no return' which we didnt have in Ang Lee's movie. Another issue is the soundtrack, which didnt blend in with the movie. Danny Elfman was never the right choice to conduct the score for this picture because his music cues were of gothic nature, and thats not what you want for the Hulk. If you watch the 1977 Pilot episode, the music by Joe Harnell is superb to the story, who can forget the 'Lonely man theme'. I did notice some tunes were similar to the tunes used in Pilot Hulk (when the first Hulk is out in crisis of flat tyre). The main theme was fine, but the hymns and african instruments didn't work, this is the type of soundtrack you have for a film like Gladiator or Batman. The purpose of film music is to guide your emotions, which the Pilot Hulk did with perfection and we didnt get that in Ang lees Hulk. Also in the film the Hulk didnt really have a purpose, he just went round smashing things pointlessly. Again that is something the Pilot Hulk had because it dealt with ethical issues. Another thing is i didnt like the look of the split screen viewing, although i can understand Ang lee wanted it to luk like a comic book, but it didnt work because it just got irritating as the audience wasn't focused on one scene. As for the acting it was reasonable, Eric Bana could never match the performance of Bill Bixby but he was ok. Jennifer Connelly and Nick Nolte were good choices however i was disappointed to see Lou Ferigno lasting only 2 seconds on screen! i mean what was the point. The film overall wasn't all bad though, its viewable and the effects were good, but when will film makers learn that the success of a movie isn't measured by good CGI effects!",,21 July 2003
Piece of ...,"OK, I know a lot of people liked this movie and said it was really great and all that... but it wasn't. I mean, sure, it had great Special Effects, and... well... thats about it. The actors weren't great, the story sucked, and what the hell was with the Father turning into that monster thing... its like when they made Scrappy Doo bad in Scooby. Anyways, me not liking it has nothing to do with me not knowing the story, or because I just don't like Super heroes, because, believe me...I do. I read X-Men, Spider-Man, Iron Man, and more... I just didn't like it. Here's how I would rate all the Marvel Movies made since 2000 to now.

... neither fish nor fowl...,"THE HULK is a marvel character most beloved by little kids. Kids adore can relate to his raw rage and brute strength. But, this is *not* a film for kids. After all the pre-release HULK merchandising aimed at kids, this is sort of tragic. I think young children will be bored silly by the extensive buildup of backstory on the characters, and traumatized by some of the violence.

The CG animated HULK's motion is reminiscent of the 1933 King Kong.

Great roles for Jennifer Connelly and Nick Nolte. Oh, speaking of Nolte... remember that infamous photo he got so much bad press over last year? My guess is that he was in makeup for the role - who knew that was advance PR for THE HULK!

Cinematography and sound are fabulous. Little touches - like the guitar and ambient conversation in a restaurant sequence... vivid sound, cinerama-makes-it-really-real sound. I predict an academy nod for the sound.

Saw this film at a screening full of jaded industry types, but during the climactic final confrontation between Hulk and his dad, the entire theater broke out laughing - my date and I got the sense this scene was s'posed to be high drama, not comedic. Considered this a bad sign.

A friend said he kept thinking Jim Carrey should have been the Hulk - would have brought new meaning to the words 'Bruce Almighty'

Some excellent sequences - the San Francisco sequence totally rocks, but at the end, the end is intentionally ambiguous and once again I think kids are gonna be lost.

Was thinking: The Hulk is not dissimilar to Matrix Reloaded, these two films both featuring a new level of cerebral tension juxtaposed with blockbuster dynamics. A new level of intellect meeting shootemup... perhaps together defining a new standard for cinema for the future...

My big question, will America bite on this? I was amazed to see the screening so full, not a seat to be had in the house, standing room only crowd.

It's a powerful film, it's thought-provoking and emotional and intellectual.

And, it's kinda cool to put those adjectives into a review for an action pic.

Rate this one 5 outta 10. Maybe 5 1/2. Yeah. I'm tough.",,18 June 2003
Coma inducing boredom!,"This film is unbelievably long and dull. The VERY long intro into how Banner becomes the Hulk is filled with cheap soap opera facial close ups and backed by the most BORING dialogue. When the film arrives at a point where something should happen, it's comical! The hulk is neither sympathic and to be pitied (as the story would like the audience to feel) nor is he frightening. (as the history of the character portrays) The poor special effects made me think of Shrek. Not even an angry one, just a ""special"" poorly animated Shrek. The story is so long and drawn out that it's not even interesting! The transfers between scenes are distracting and over used. The special effects are not special at all.

The ending was a relief! I wanted to walk, but my husband wouldn't join me so I sat in torture through the whole thing hoping that an ACME safe or anvil would fall from the cinema roof and put me out of my misery. I tried to sleep, but the noisy action sequences kept waking me up.",,13 July 2003
A high pact cinemagraphic film with original direction.,This film is the best comic book film made to this date. The cinematography of this film is unique. And I fell in love with the live action comic book direction. Ang Lee did a wonderful job. If anyone has seen this film they understand what I mean. It was far more creative than X-Men or Spiderman and looked way more realistic than spiderman (spiderman was way to cartoon like and wacky). I am indebted to Ang Lee for a wonderful Movie experience.,,2 July 2003
Hulk is good.,"I've never read a Hulk comic in my life.

I think I might have seen the TV show when I was very young, around 2 or so, and for some reason I remember dreaming that he threw me down the stairs. Other than that, I had little prior knowledge before I saw this movie (except that his pants were always purple and never tore off). Therefore I had few expectations, except that with Ang Lee in charge, this wouldn't be another Spider-Man.

Not that there was anything wrong with Spider-Man. I absolutely loved it. But with the rash (you might even call it a plague) of comic adaptations at the moment, do we really NEED another Spider-Man? Do we really WANT another Spider-Man? Another silly, campy popcorn blockbuster family movie?

Judging by some of the other comments I've read, and the reactions of some of the people near me when I saw this, the answer is YES. People seem to want to go to the movies and not be at all surprised. They want to see the same movie they saw last time they went. They want formula. They want predictability. They want to have the movie planned in their heads before they enter the cinema, and have it play out according to that plan. Nothing unexpected.

People seem to think a movie about a gargantuan green man who jumps around and smashes things can't--or shouldn't--be poignant, moving, or serious. But WHY NOT?! I ask you...

The movie's pacing, one of the most sniped-at aspects, is essential to helping us understand where Bruce is coming from. We need to see him grow up, we need to know his past, need to KNOW that he's been bottling his anger up inside his entire life. And of course we all know what's coming, so the tension increases as we wait for him to SNAP. If we'd seen him transform any earlier than we did, and it had just been Hulk smashing stuff up, I don't think it would have worked as well. Don't get me wrong, I love action, but I believe the setup was necessary for us to sympathise with him, and accept (or even condone) his destructive actions.

The CG was fantastic! Don't listen to the people who say he didn't look real or whatever. How can he look REAL? He's a FIVE metre tall GREEN person with a physique Lou Ferrigno could never even DREAM of. His muscles ripple. He has weight. And he can ACT! He's a THREE-DIMENSIONAL CHARACTER! You can tell what he's thinking by looking at his FACE (""I'm so annoyed right now!"", ""Hey, that Betty's pretty hot!"", or whatever...you know...:)

All the acting was fine. I still see a little bit of Poida every time I look at Eric, but that's starting to wear off. He does a commendable job. Jen is great as always, adding weight to what could have been a lame love interest. Sam Elliot was also really good (but what the hell was going' on with that moustache?). And Nick Nolte, who I usually try to steer clear of (I dunno, he just creeps me out a bit), was excellent. Who says there was no comic relief?

The cinematography was cool, especially on Hulk's rampage, and I thought the editing (with the much-discussed wipes, split-screens and fades) worked very well. I didn't even notice the music, which they say is the sign of a good score.

DON'T take the kids. Buy the LARGE Coke. And settle in for a GREAT movie.

I just remembered something else I knew about the Hulk. From Stan Lee's little speech to Brodie in Mallrats (another deep, moving, and unfairly maligned movie gem), where he describes the Hulk as ""a normal guy one minute, a rage of emotions the next"". So I guess I expected that. And that's exactly what I got. Oh no, I AM a mindless, insipid movie zombie. That makes me so ANGRY!",,27 June 2003
Loved It!,"Ok,

Since the Hulk dropped a whopping 70% percent in the 2nd week of its release. I'm going to guess the only people who will still be interested in seeing this movie, will be fans of Ang Lee. So here goes a review for you guys.

First off, this is not a pure action movie. So don't bring the kids to see it because they will get impatient and ruin your experience. This movie involves a lot of really great interactions between characters. There is professional soldier (Thunderbolt) and his much ignored daughter (betty). There is the father and son (read experiment) relationship between David and Bruce. And of course there is the relationship between the emotionless Bruce Banner and the Raging beast that is bubbling up beneath the surface.

Ang Lee uses a lot of close up shot of the actors to let you into there emotional state. You can tell the actors were very passionate about the material they were given. Nick Nolte and Sam Shepard give some of the most powerful performance I have seen in any of their roles. It climaxes in a scene between Eric Bana and Nick Nolte sitting infront of a lighted stage, giving a two man performance. Nolte trying to mentally beatdown his Bana in the tradition of all the great torture movies like Deer Hunter. It brings the Movies back to the stage, where the actor is main reason why you come to see, not the special effects. I loved this sequence. It was almost like Ang Lee and James Schamus saying, hey..we got the Studios to give $150 million dollars, let sneaking something from our days in the theater.

About the transitions and so called ""comic book"" editing. The Hulk was a creation of a mad scientist experiment. So how do you reflect this pacing in a movie? Simple, you layer shots in the fore ground, back ground, side wipes, comic panels...all mashed it together like some mad science expriment of its own. Wonderful, wonderful, theory which really worked for me. It added to the confusion and swiss cheese memory of our main character, Bruce Banner.

And finally, the so ""Hulk Dogs"" that everyone seems to complain about. I thought that was Ang Lee's dark sense of humor that he was able to sneak past the studios. For all of you who have walked past one of those annoying french poodles that seem to bark at you even if you are not looking at them. You will get your revenge in this movie I promise you. This sequence shows that our director has a little Raging Hulk of his own bottle up inside him.",,29 June 2003
"The biggest disappointment of the summer of 2003,and it shows","The summer of 2003 was without a doubt a lineup of incoming material and nevertheless a lot of sequels that made the cut or by the landscape drop from sight of the public view. Even though the summer season came on strong with some good ones,""X2"",""Matrix Reloaded"",""Terminator 3"",""Bad Boys II"",and the disappointments like the sequels to ""Charlie's Angels"", ""Legally Blonde"",and ""The Fast And The Furious"". Here is one film that was great in the visual and special effects department,but instead became one of the biggest disappointments of the summer. Director Ang Lee's rendering of the simplest and the most complex characters in the Marvel Comics pantheon is very laughably and fatally complicated by modern senstivities with a huge overhaul of the green giant who the public recognize by the Marvel Comics,and also from the classic 1970's TV series ""The Incredible Hulk"",which starred Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno.

Instead of presenting the Hulk as an raging,unfettered id,Lee offers a nonsensical post-Freudian mishmash of moviations instead of him coming out to be the creature who wrecks havoc and leaves a path of destruction whereever he goes and the movie doesn't show the mean side. This new and neutered giant,whom computer digitalized,who doesn't even appear until 45 minutes into this long,long film,is a gentle misunderstood soul who never kills or destroys for the raw gratification of it which Lee didn't go by within the comic book format. He's a carefully inoffensive concoction who is up against the not only the soul that possesses him,but goes through a chain of events leading to the destruction of everything that stands in his way. Lets face it,where is the villain here? As for the leading character here,Eric Bana's Bruce Banner is very dull and boring and he is the reason why this picture went very low. That's the negative side. The positive side of this is that Jennifer Connelly and Sam Elliott do yeoman's work in a daughter-father subplot here;she is Dr. Banner's assistant Betty Ross,and her father is General Ross--likewise. The only bad guy or close to a baddy is Nick Nolte who plays Banner's wicked father. The night I saw this,I saw three people in the audience almost fell asleep on this one,since this movie runs over two hours.",,10 July 2003
Not bad!,"I understand a lot of people are disappointed with this movie because of it's slow first half and overly serious tone. But this could be expected with Ang Lee as a director. I knew this wouldn't be another Batman or Barbed Wire. I don't have a problem with the pace of the movie, but with the lack of content presented in it's first half. Sure, there's enough material for a half hour tops, but not an hour. I think a filmmaker like Ang Lee could have added more to that first hour than elementary (pseudo?-)psychology and split screens. A lot of things in the plot were kept a little thin or unspoken. I think it would have been better to cut some more out of it or to add pace. One more negative is the monster in the end: it looked way too vague. The CGI-generated Hulk, however, looks really detailed and shows enough basic emotions to look real.

I thought Spiderman had a more balanced mix of humour, plot and action. And X-Men 1 and 2 had way more pace. Humour was completely lacking in The Hulk, and unfortunately not compensated with much suspense or drama. The action however is fine, though completely over the top. Example: The Hulk clinges on an aircraft which flies almost out of the Earth's atmosphere into space. The Hulk falls off the jet and crashes down. Not even a scratch, broken bone or a twisted ankle!!! But hey it's a comic book filming. I guess it's on of the Hulk's superpowers. You just have to be patient because have to wait an hour to witness them.

Good things about the movie are Nolte as the hermit-like scientist (and father), Connelly as the frail and sensitive opposite of The Hulk, Bana as the nerdy Bruce Banner and the CGI-effects. It's also nice to see a comic-book adaptation with a little more depth and story.

All in all, some complaints but still a good movie worth watching. 7,5 out of 10.

Bring on the sequels and next time, give Hulkie some more punchlines to add to ""Puny Human!"" (his only line in this film!).",,1 August 2003
A few years later...,,,10 September 2010
Incredibly Bad,"Following in the success of recent Marvel films like X-Men and Spider-Man comes Hulk. Directed by Ang Lee and starring Eric Bana as Bruce Banner Hulk doesn't quite deliver what it set out to do.

The film starts off with a little backstory, a little too much backstory if you ask me, and doesn't really get started until a half hour into the movie. The Hulk himself looks so bad that at one point when Nick Nolte touches his face it looks as though he's touching a velvet painting. The movie feels way too long, I kept checking my watch every five minutes, and the ending feels like it was tacked on at the last minutes.

I left the theater wanting a refund. The Hulk is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I wouldn't watch it again if you paid me.",,10 May 2004
Truly the modern mythology of our times,"Deemed as too serious' by the general American audience, this film was overlooked during its theatrical run. Due to the prominent use of CGI in the film, the purists of Hollywood and the critical world jumped on the anti-hulk bandwagon, judging it solely based on principles. Comic fans, as they do, said it wasn't an accurate enough representation of the story of the Hulk, and their views were tainted. With all of this to go up against, who was left to like it? The few people in America who can enjoy it for what it was (oh yeah, and the rest of the world, but since it was a Hollywood film, there's only one continent the producers judge success on).

Ang Lee created a visual comic book, a revolutionary use of CGI in movies, and, more importantly (based on the interviews with him surrounding the film) the film he really wanted to make. Using probably every tool in Avid (I think that's the name), Ang Lee and Tim Squyres edit the film in a way that the movie feels like and looks like the most accurate comic book adaptation during this whole recent trend, possibly since Dick Tracy (not counting graphic novels, in which case Road to Perdition would obviously be the forerunner). The other stories (Spiderman, Daredevil, etc) may be more accurate, I'm in no position to judge that, but watching the Hulk I felt as if I was reading a comic book, which I can't say for any of the others. Also, it I really liked how it was a more serious story, dealing with these issues in a more serious manner. Comic books have been called the mythology of our times. If this is true, then Hulk' stands alone as the one movie attempting to treat our modern mythology with the respect it deserves. With this film already out on video, go rent it, give it a shot, with a healthy video life a sequel will probably be made, and the adventures of the Hulk can begin. Rating: 30/40",,29 October 2003
The Hulk is a big disappointment,"The Hulk is a poorly done movie and does not live to its expectations as one would thought. Its starts out with the nuclear physicist we know as Robert Bruce Banner, who ravagely turns into the fierce, angry hulk after being exposed to gamma radiation. Bruce, who tries to keep this alter ego a secret, fails. Jennifer Connealy, who plays as Bruce's girlfriend Betty Ross, knows that something is up with him and her daddy comes in to finish the job, even though she doesn't want Bruce dead or hurt, for that matter.

The movie has a lot of drawbacks when one analyzes it. The first drawback I've realized is that the whole story about Bruce Banner's father being a villain with powers, and experimenting on Bruce Banner when he was a kid, is entirely not true to the marvel comics. If there's one thing I don't like, its directors who put in made up stories for their so-called ""Marvel movie"" superheroes.

Another thing I really couldn't stand about the movie was Ang Lee's directing. Its was terrible! He does a comic book like technique, and uses the same technique over and over again until the movie looks dryer than a prune baking in the hot summer day.

The characters in the story is possibly the biggest reason why I didn't like the movie. Bruce Banner, and the rest of the cast seemed to be very bland. Too much talking about his past which isn't even true to the comics. Bruce Banner's father who is played by Nick Nolte, is a character no one wants to see. The acting Nick Nolte does for this insanely dull character is just that, insanely dull. He babbles on and on until you can't take it anymore and literally just want to shoot 'em down with your spaz 12 shotgun when you see him on screen. Bruce Banner also had very boring attributes. He didn't seem to make any new territoral grounds playing as the Hulk neither. His character just wasn't as riveting as one would expect from the comics.

In conclusion, the movie stunk in almost every aspect. Yes, even the special effects. I didn't like the way they made Hulk's face. It didn't look like the Hulk I once remembered in the comics or cartoon series. Possibly the only scene I did like was the very last shot of the film. Its the part where you see Bruce Banner as a fugitive in a safari like area, wearing his famous basket hat with his cool sunglasses on. A nice disguise for a fugitive on the run. And at least that was the only part that really looked true to the comics.",,24 June 2003
A massive clunker.,"* 1/2 out of ****

Pirates of the Caribbean was the most disappointing film of summer 2003 because it promised more fun than it actually delivered. The Hulk comes in a close second because its pedigree (from the cast to director Ang Lee) would seemingly indicate we'd get a film that's far superior to the final cut of this horribly overlong clunker.

Maybe the Hulk was never suited for big screen material, but it's more likely Ang Lee just mucked up the execution. He clearly wants to inject his films with the deeper meaning, to question and explore the very psyche of the film's protagonist, Bruce Banner (Eric Bana). Truth be told, I'm not partial to this approach, but I could grudgingly accept it if delivered and executed competently. It's not.

From the dull performances to the pretentious tone, Hulk consistently does little more than make the viewer every bit as angry as the green beast himself, only because one was foolish enough to actually fork over some hard-earned cash to see the film.

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the fact that Lee wants to put characters over action, an approach that has constantly appealed to me, but there's a catch here; not one single character is likable and/or sympathetic. Bana is a good actor, but he radiates little screen presence or charisma as Banner, I neither felt nor cared for his supposed mental and physical anguish.

As his ex-girlfriend, Jennifer Connelly is even less convincing, resorting to little more than shedding tears when the situation goes awry. Connelly is one of those actresses whose marked improvements over the years (she was an awful actress from the mid-80's to early 90's) has impressed me, but this is her worst performance in years. In other supporting roles, Josh Lucas is okay but perfunctorily one-dimensional as the villain, and Sam Elliot does his gruff thing yet again, and it's not nearly as amusing here as it was in We Were Soldiers (where much of it was played for laughs; he's deadly serious here). Nick Nolte is hilariously over-the-top as mad scientist Bruce Banner, it'd be amusing if it wasn't so earnest.

The movie as a whole is about anger, that seething, boiling rage lurking under the surface just waiting for the catalyst that'll unleash its ugly face. There is, unfortunately, only so much a film of this sort can do to deal with such a topic, and it doesn't even maximize such potential during the action sequences.

The Hulk (the big man himself) is a passable special effect, better than you'd expect, but not as good as you'd hope for, and while the green lug does get in a few pretty cool moments (leaping around the desert, for instance), he's utterly wasted in this movie's few paltry action sequences. There's a general rule of thumb of mine that any superhero action movie should pit our hero against stronger villains (a rule the recent X2 also broke). Not the case here, where most of Hulk's fighting is against the U.S. military. This is without mentioning that the Hulk not only has super strength and super agility, he's also practically invulnerable to harm because of a quick healing factor; a hero who virtually can't die? Bye-bye, suspense.

The one scene where the Hulk does fight someone with superior powers to his own is set in the dark, and I could barely make anything out during this battle, which hardly lasts past a minute and is wholly anti-climactic compared to the slightly more engaging Hulk vs. the military confrontation.

Danny Elfman's horrible score rounds out the rest of this lackluster picture. It's a rip-off of his own work in Spider-Man, which itself was a rip-off of his superior work in Batman. Lesson to Elfman: a score of this style won't work for every superhero.

Ang Lee crafts the film with a ""wink-wink""-style camera-work, splicing in lots of comic-book style scene transitions, reminding viewers they are indeed watching an adaptation of a popular comic book. Not only are the transitions themselves annoying, but they're a persistent reminder of how much more fun it would be to actually skim through an issue of the Hulk than to actually watch this film.",,6 May 2004
This movie stinks,"It just kept getting worse and worse. This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen--it is in the same dismal league as Battlefield Earth. It was b o r i n g, the 'science' was way, way dumb and impossible to follow, the special effects' weren't--not even close, the characters were stupidly drawn with incomprehensible motivations, the music was awful--dissonant, amelodic, and way too load, and then they started to have gratuitous torture (literally--torture for torture's sake) and I could barely keep lunch down. And I kept waiting for (hoping for) the Malibu police to arrest Nick Nolte.",,25 June 2003
Ok--Hope the next one is better,"I was a little disappointed with this movie. First I have to say that I loved the way it was filmed except for the fact that it was too dark in some scenes to see very well. I did not care for Eric Bana as Bruce Banner. I did not come to love him or even really like him like I have with other superheros. I didn't feel the love story connection either. Even though the beginning did drag, I do think that it was important to lay the ground work for the youth in america today that haven't ""experienced"" The Hulk before. Maybe the sequel will be better.....",,6 July 2003
THE HULK,"I am probably like most movie goers, I like a lot of action. I was disappointed with the Hulk. It took too long for him to appear. The whole Nick Nolte character took up too much time. This was nearly as well done as the Spider Man. On a scale from 1 to 10 I would give it a 6.5.",,22 June 2003
shrek or hulk,"i cant tell who is more animated, shrek or the hulk?? they both look alot alike, im sure shrek would kick the hulks butt!!! any awy, what i am trying to say is, i think they would have been better off with lou ferigno, the hulk is way to animated, and he looks like shrek!!",,6 August 2003
Bad Movie!,"don't waste your time or money on this one, if you must see it, wait for video. it's way too long, more than 2 hrs and the plot doesn't stay with any one specific thing and it jumps around. (so does the hulk a few times and the audience was laughing at some of these special effects). If you absolutely want to see it, go see a matinee and save that extra night time movie ticket money for something else. I wish i had walked out within the first 15 mins when i could tell this movie wasn't gonna be worth it.",,23 June 2003
worst movie ever seen,,,25 August 2003
Fantastic comic book brough to life!,"This was a great film that the movie trailers hardly did justice. This was every bit the comic book movie it was intended to be and then some.

The split screen frames and transitions looked so much like a comic book that the only thing missing were the speech bubbles.

Over all it was an easy story to follow and left you wanting more.",,23 June 2003
Not worth the money,"Sure the CGI is pretty good. Sure you get to see the Hulk tossing around tanks and people like rag dolls. Yet for the rest of the movie you are subjugated to listening to speeches about changing a person and the morality in it. The bad guys were laughable, not able to provoke any reaction from me. The last action sequence was totally dark and you are unable to see anything besides swirling colours and hear maniacal laughter. Sorry, that doesn't do it for me. If you want to spend money watching the Hulk bounce 10 miles at a time, don't let me stop you. If you're looking for a good enjoyable movie however, your money is safer elsewhere.",,27 June 2003
Avoid this Movie,"This movie was an ""Incredible"" waste of time. The Hulk was fake and rarely seen. The opening of this movie was enough to put me into peaceful slumber. In my opinion this movie craps all over what made the Hulk great and Ang Lee should be ashamed. Avoid this movie at every cost or wait till you can watch for free because it maybe hard to make it through the entire movie of total garbage.

"I'm not vivid, but this was AWFUL","I don't know if I'll get around to writing my scathing review of how much I disliked HULK, so I'll make a few points.

HULK is the worst film that I have paid money to see this year. It was too long, needed a lot of unnecessary scenes and characters removed, lacked a truly menacing villain, had boring characters developed not to mention dull performances, the film took itself too seriously, it became unintentionally funny SEVERAL times and the CGI hulk looked like shiit.",,21 June 2003
Hulk looked Fine...Storyline Didn't.,,,14 July 2003
"you want get very, very angry","Well, I can't say that I was bored or really, really bored but I am definitely not gonna see the sequel. When I heard that they are bringing Hulk to the big screen I was expecting a lot of rage and action, but sorry to disappoint you, there wasn't much of it. There was plenty of anxiously looking Jennifer Connelly and timid and lost in his thoughts Eric Bana but not much of the green fellow.

To be honest the few actually two action scenes were good. CGI were convincing when there was no interaction with real actors. The scenes with Hulk and Betty (Jennifer Connelly) together were, well let just say not cool. The human eye is so sensitive that it will take many years and technological breakthroughs till it can be fooled. Till then it would be better to avoid close interaction between CGI and actors. Ops sorry I got carried away.

Over all, if you wanna see bigger Shrek, OK much bigger Shrek kinking some, unfortunately only few a**** like a King Kong you may give it a try. And after seeing the movie I would appreciate if you could tell me: why don't Eric Bana's pants burst as he turns into Hulk? If they had just given him Jeff Bridges' huge Bermuda shorts that he wore in ""The Big Lebowski"" it would have been so much more convincing.",,25 July 2003
"""clink clink"" thats the sound of millions of bucks going to waste!","I've looked at the pictures, ive seen the trailers and now ive seen the movie and all i can say is this... OH MY GOD, what on earth have they done. There are several issues here firstly when is ang lee gonna show up and actually direct this thing? i saw none of his previous talents being used here.

Secondly, if you hire b-movie actors the resulting ""computer generated motion-picture"" is gonna be b-movie style. But to call this a b-movie kinda disses the genre - attack of the 50ft woman comes to mind, yeah there's an idea for the sequel (which there will be unfortunatly) give the big green shrek lookalike a set of matching panties and bra omg think of the merchandising posibilities! it would get all those chicks involved in action films too! This film doesn't suck, it doesn't do anything it's just another big budget low quality movie, a different cast and to be honest a different director might have made this the best comic-book turned movie ever. Stan Lee would be turning in his grave at the travesty that is called the hulk (notice they dropped the word increddible) Oh yeah thats right he isnt dead... he should be for letting this one get past wastebasket... I just don't get who this film is aimed at - its certainly not the die hard fans of the 70's series, it can't be a new younger generation because it lacks alot for a big budget action flick i.e. decent action sequences I wont spoil the plot because there isn't one its full of holes! the script is too damn deep and the acting is too low grade (wonder what they paid nolte to do the part of david? few beers and a get out of jail free card?) If ya wanna see a movie this summer that will rock yer world dont see this go see matrix 2, italian job or even finding nemo... angry man it pi****ed me right off!",,18 June 2003
Ang Lee works magic,"Ang Lee has truly captured the essence of the story board concept of comic books and adapted that for the big screen. Its a shame his vision has been lost on the masses. Scene after scene appeared as if ripped right from a frame! Those interested only in proven formulatic cookie cutter adventure/ action movies will be disappointed. Those who grew up reading, collecting and dreaming of involvement in comics will stand up and cheer.

It can't really be compared to the other offerings of Marvel's mainstays as it is unlike any of the predecessors. That being said, it will draw comparisons. Go decide for yourself where it ranks. However, be advised; over time this film should be remembered as the best adaptation of paper and ink to celluoid that Hollywood has offered.

'nuff said",,6 July 2003
Never did I believe Ang Lee would sink this low...,"A piece of advice: Do not see this movie... Okay, go ahead and watch it, I strongly recommend it if you're suffering from insomnia!

I've never in my life wasted good money on something and truly regretted it afterwards... after half an hour, I was considering going to the ticket office and demanding my money back... Why I didn't?

Well, first of all, it wasn't their fault the movie SUCKED, and second, I was kind of hoping the movie would come around... It was, after all, Ang Lee...

BAD me, bad bad bad BAD me! NEVER ever go see a movie just because it was made by a specific director again, BAD me!

There was a plot, believe it or not, and it would have WORKED, if it hadn't been for the length of the film... It was sooooo duuuuullll and soooo increeeeeeediblyyyy loooong...

It's a bad sign when your butt starts getting sore after fifteen minutes, if it's a good movie, you won't notice that! I noticed, and I sat squirming in my seat for two freaking hours...

The animation was... weeeeell, so and so.... But the character HULK didn't work for me... I mean, they could have put Shrek in that movie and that would have worked better! ( In my opinion, Shrek was better animated too! ) The killer dogs were completely stupid... Every time I saw the poodle, I'd poke my friend next to me and whisper ""Püttel Hündt"" ( I think that's my dad's very CRUDE Swedish translation of that particular canine race ! )

I have to admit, that seeing this movie brought back a lot of memories... of Super Mario Bros. 3! Remember back in the early 90's, when the ordinary Nintendo box was THE best toy you could own? And Super Mario Bros. 3 ( the one in the yellow packings ) was the hottest and most hightech game you could get?! Well, Hulk's jumping around when escaping from the military base reminded me A LOT of that, and I poked my brother and we started humming the theme for that game... that was a great game...

I don't even wanna go anywhere NEAR the acting... Eric Bana, well... I don't know him, and I don't really wanna ditch him because of a stupid movie that COULD have been good, but went really really wrong... Jennifer Connelly! Wow... Sure she can act, why doesn't she show it... I had to go all the way to Nick Nolte to find someone who WAS actually acting in a way that I enjoyed... and he ended it up by OVER acting! *grabs her head and slams it into the keyboard in front of her* *Grroooooooooooooooooan*

I think the best thing about this movie was the score! Danny Elfman, always a pleasure! No problems there...

Anyway, nevermind my little rant here... But go see TombRaider II instead... That's actually ENTERTAINING....!",,24 August 2003
"Not my kind of movie, but...","While this certainly wasn't my kind of film, I enjoyed The Hulk far more than I expected. Though the CGI sometimes made me cringe, it is mostly effective in supporting the rather engaging story, which boils down to a simple morality tale about parent/child relationships (the Bana/Nolte and Conelly/Elliot pairings make for a nice thematic duality), self-denial through repression and existential fear. Though these themes could have been explored with a bit more brevity (not unlike Unbreakable the film often comes off as being unnecessarily ponderous) they do make for a very pleasant, reflective first half, character development successfully balancing out necessary exposition. In fact, the film has surprisingly little action - the real conflict takes place in Bruce Banner's angst-filled, damaged psyche. What you see in the trailers is pretty much what you get action-wise. However, sometimes Ang Lee goes a bit overboard with both the comic-book visuals and his symbolism, with comes across as more than just a bit pretentious (the repeated, seemingly unmotivated shots of desert flowers are explained by the fact that they trigger one of Bruce's memories by reminding him of his mother's perfume).

The score, including the vocals, worked perfectly, with the exception of Hulk's arrival at the AF base and his jumping across the desert (this is where the middle-eastern pieces come in for apparently no good reason whatsoever). Otherwise, the cascading string motif, twinkly science theme and delicate love theme served the film well (the softer vocals indeed represent Banner's mental anguish, as Ryan correctly hypothesized).

I must admit, however, that at times I came very close to falling asleep, while at others I rolled my eyes quite heavily. The Akira-like final showdown between David and Bruce is also quite elusive to me - don't ask me what exactly the hell was going on.",,22 July 2003

The Incredible Sulk,"Yes, the movie is bad. Quite bad at that. Connelly and Bana have the chemistry of two primates grooming each other, but without the excitement. How Bana could have turned in such a yawn-inducing, stiff performance in a movie who's character is founded on extreme emotional mood swings is beyond me. Connelly seems to have had her lines phoned in....long distance even. But maybe it's not completely their own faults, one couldn't do much better with a script the likes of this one. Honestly, she sees a 20 foot naked green monster who's face resembles her boyfriend baring down on her for the first time, and barely let's out a halfhearted sigh? And that's just the tip of the titanic iceberg of laughable scenes. Too, the comic-book-page style editing might have seemed like a smart idea on paper, but it winded up looking instead like someone's housecat jumped up on the editing board and ran across the keys. If you really want to see the movie there is one saving grace, however; Sam Elliot's perfectly coiffured moustache. Coincidentally, it has some of the smartest lines in the film too.... ;-)",,22 July 2003

You Might Not Like Me When I'm Ang Lee,"But I did.

Hulk wasn't at all what I expected. But as often as not, that is a good thing. A monster Hollywood blockbuster does eventually burst out of this quieter, and surprisingly thoughtful sort of movie and in handling the pre-Hulk backstory, Ang Lee demonstrates the same sense and sensibility for his subject he showed in The Ice Storm. This first half of the film is slow, and it's that sense of inertia that most audiences, drawn in by the trailer, will have the greatest trouble overcoming. So much of that first half is an intelligent exploration of character, trauma and the basis for the rage that is so terribly repressed in our central character, that if you can get past the slow motion pace of it all, it's highly rewarding. Enhanced all the more by some inventive, artistic and skilful scene transitions that seem designed to remind us that this is a marriage of two media: comic-book and movie. Further enhancement materialises in the performances from Jennifer Connelly, Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte and even Eric Bana - all of whom seem to take their comic book stuff very seriously.

And why shouldn't they. This is not kid stuff. Kids (and many an adult) will be growing impatient for Banner to become large and green.

Still, when the Hulk does emerge in all his green glory, he is spectacular and, thanks mostly to the solid foundation that the film has spent so long laying down, it's that earlier half that, more than the quality of the CGI, that renders the creature all the more convincing. Unfortunate moments featuring a monster poodle tend to undermine all that and really seem to belong in another movie. What the Hulk really needed was an opponent as convincing as the rest of his supporting cast, and Nick Nolte serves well, but once we are in Hollywood blockbuster fx spectacular territory, the direction in which we're headed and the ending elude us.

Sadly, they seem to elude the movie just as well, although on one level it's a fitting comic-book conclusion that has its roots in Oriental mythology, culminating in an inconclusive, elemental and highly surreal battle between what are essentially a couple of gods. Visually stunning, perhaps, but dramatically disappointing.

Still, credit to Ang Lee for taking on the franchise and still managing to make an Ang Lee film. It's not hip, witty, Spiderman material, and plenty of people will be wishing it had been, but for me the Hulk is much more of a Crouching, Hidden sort of creature and Ang Lee translates this comic book creation to screen along with some terrific artwork.",,3 September 2003
Not a summer action movie,"I like the original story of the Hulk much more than the Superman or other superheroes. It was dark, depressing and ended with tragedy. Don't you just love that?

Now the movie, compare to other summer action movies, the Hulk is far more sophisticated. Might because it was Ang Lee who made it, or it was the original story. The Hulk may not be for youngsters even it was rated only PG-13 because those youngsters might not enjoy it as much as adults.

2 hours or so was painfully long, beautiful camera, beautiful editing, and the story was so dark. Forget about scientific facts, this movie did not make you believe, but make you think. Great casts, no one could have done better than that.

I expected to see a summer action movie, but the experience was quite opposite. It was not as 'fun' as Spiderman or X-men but it was definitely entertaining.

I Miss Lou Ferrigno.....,"When it comes to comic book characters coming to the big screen, I am a fanatic. I grew up watching re-runs of the old 70's Hulk series (starring Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno and Jack Colvin) and I was basically hooked to super heroes. When I heard this film was coming out with a CGI Hulk I said to myself ""Oh My God."" As a fan I just said maybe it will be better than expected, I was wrong. Even though the action sequences were good, it just seemed to fake for the Hulk to leap miles to miles. I mean all I see is Superman of Marvel.

Well here's the story, Dr. David Bruce Banner is experimenting on himself to help release his anger side when he finds out his wife's pregnant. Knowing that he will pass down the mutant gene he anticipated his child's arrival. When he is born David continues his experiments....on his son. After a huge miltary confrontation, we fast forward years later. Dr. Bruce Banner is now the same kind of scientist who thinks his parents died years before. After an accident in his lab with radiation, he is put in the hospital. However, he appears to be fine and in better health than ever, when a mysterious man claiming to be his father walks in and explains to him why he survived the radiation and why he seems right at home in a science lab. Shortly after he has his first transformation. Like I said the film isn't the worst, but I miss Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno. Jennifer Connely (Labyrinth)co-stars as Bruces' love interest. Nick Nolte (48HRS) plays the aging David Banner and Sam Elliot (Mask) appears as Jennifer Connelys military father. I give this film ** 1/2 out of *****",,12 July 2003

Anger Management,"THE HULK (2003) *** Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Nick Nolte, Sam Elliott, Josh Lucas. Filmmaker Ang Lee's ambitious and audacious big screen take on the classic Marvel Comics' anti-hero, 'The Incredible Hulk' and his moody alter ego research scientist Bruce Banner (Bana) incorporates a complicated CGI monster with fairly decent effects  more so the emotional than the physical  and a 'sins of the father' storyline as it is discovered his estranged (and simply, strange) scientist dad (Nolte, in a truly unkempt turn for the best here) experimented on him in his toddler hood with a genetic coded dormant monster waiting to be unleashed (cue: accidental exposure to gamma rays) and a furious attempt to struggle the Jekyll/Hyde implications thereof.

The film works more or less in favor of a thinking man's version of a comic book character best known for getting into a serious rage and tearing up anything in his wake. Lee's genius is in the production design (notably the medium's panel drawings etched on the screen in impressive editing techniques to give the feel of a comic book) and the shrewd screenplay by collaborator James Schamus (along with Michael France, John Turman and David Hayter) but stumbles somewhat in the action sequences (many taking place in badly lit night-time incidents). Look sharp for Lou Ferrigno (tv's Hulk) and Stan Lee (the creature's creator) as security guards in cameos",,1 July 2003

Ingmar Bergman directs Shrek 2,"The Hulk is one of my favorite comics; I'm a die-hard Ang Lee fan (Ice Storm, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon); Jennifer Connelly is my favorite woman in the known Universe... On paper, this movie had so much going for it, I don't see how it could possibly fail. That's usually when it fails miserably, and boy did it ever. Oh brother. What a mess.

It's a turkey. A very cold, lifeless, angst-ridden turkey at that. Some refer to Ang Lee's Hulk as the ""refreshingly intelligent"" take on comic book adaptations. Well, all I can say is that these quotes from ""A Fish Called Wanda"" have never felt more relevant:

Wanda: ""You think you're an intellectual, don't you, ape?"" Otto: ""Apes don't read philosophy!"". Wanda: ""Yes they do, Otto, they just don't understand it.""

Frankly I'm tempted to believe that the producers watched Face/Off and thought they'd stumbled upon the ideal director for Hulk, but in their excitement and ignorance they happened to call up Ang Lee instead of John Woo, and realized the mistake when it was too late. Their second big mistake was to schedule it for a summer release; this movie is so cold, gloomy and dead serious, it was doomed to be the ugly duckling among the usual fast, fun-filled action adventure romps.

It appears as if Ang Lee (I will call him Angst Lee from now on) was attempting to make three different movies at once (a Greek tragedy, a testosterone pumped action movie, and a deep Bergman drama) and ended up making no movie whatsoever. The flavors just don't blend together - it's like being served hot pepper filet mignon with chocolate gravy and garlic/vanilla ice cream.

The Hulk has a drawn out, probing, pretentious, meditative pace that is 110% inappropriate for the subject matter. It is completely devoid of humour - I didn't even smile once. It's deep (or so it thinks), angst-ridden, cold and dark, and thoroughly unengaging. Have you ever zapped through late night TV and accidentally stumbled upon a modern dance or ballet performance, and stopped for a few minutes to marvel at the utter emptyness of it all? Like, ""Wow... these clowns actually think they're communicating or conveying human emotions here?"". The same feeling kept surfacing as I was watching Hulk. These characters are alien to me. I can't connect with any of them. I don't understand their actions, I don't understand their motivations, but whatever these are, I don't care - and neither will you. You won't find yourself rooting for any of these freaks. The biggest plot hole in Hulk is the fact that all of these characters are on the screen at all, because logically they should all be in therapy.

The CGI ain't half bad (a green guy in broad daylight is a nightmare for any animator, and at times he does look a tad like Shrek), performances range from adequate to excellent, and the production design is slick - as for the rest, bring a pillow, an alarm clock, an airsickness bag and prescription anti-depressants.",,13 July 2003
TV series was better,"The other films made from Marvel Comics managed to balance the fantasy of the source material with the reality of film. This one is too fantastic for its own good. We get a cartoony-looking 15-foot tall Hulk that leaps miles into the air and tears tanks apart, computer-animated mutant dogs, and worst of all, Nick Nolte as Bruce Banner's father, who transforms into Electro-hulk, geo-hulk, and hydro-hulk. This film includes more characters from the original comic: Betty Ross, her father, Bruce's father, and Glenn Talbot. While the comic included a backstory of Bruce's abusive father, Ang Lee turns that into an overblown Oedipus-style origin story. The old TV series with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, while straying from the comic, was much better. Using a human in make-up was much more realistic and believable than the cartoon we are shown here, and the human drama of Banner trying to settle down and rid himself of the Hulk was much more compelling than what is presented here.",,31 July 2003
I was Taken Aside.,"I seemed to be a tad distracted throughout this picture. I don't know if it was the slipshod writing or what but I couldn't keep still in my seat. Overall, I thought the movie was good. The character development and the psychological emotional damage clause was pretty good and I liked it. I was a little uneasy on the acting as well. I never have been a Nick Nolte fan and did not like him in this role in this picture although, the scene at the end where he and Bruce are talking and he starts yelling, or whatever, that was exceptional. Another distraction was Jennifer Connelly who is just sensationally gorgeous and I have never really noticed until this movie. I mean, the last thing that I saw her in was ""Labyrinth"" and have yet to see ""A Beautiful Mind"" and I was kind of taken aside. So yeah, she distracted me, in a good way that is. Ang Lee did well and the cinematography was decent, especially in a few earlier shots and some that reminded me of the hallway meeting scene in ""The Rules of Attraction"" which is the only film at the time that I can think of in which you see both characters facial expressions as the other is talking and vice versa. If that made any sense. The pace could have been jumpstarted a tad, no, a lot. Almost two and a half hours long and precisely 2.5 hours long with previews, a long movie to sit through. My advice, if you can see it for free, go see it, cheap entertainment. Is it worth 8 bucks, I don't think so, but those of you that paid might :) Suckers.",,23 June 2003
misunderstood,"there is nothing wrong with this movie! what were audiences expecting? the tv variation of the fugitive? i turned 2 the imdb, which is a pretty accurate ratings guide for movies, and even they have got it into the low 6's! and rise of the machines at 7! people complain that it takes the hulk 40 minutes to show up, but once he does, hes there for another 85 minutes! and 90% of the cgi is pretty cool. and i really did feel that i got a much better understanding once he did show up because of ang lee, sparing the time in order to show us his origin. visually its breathtaking, and along with the most un-danny elfman score, and jennifer (im in love dude) connelly, i really did dig the hulk throughout. spiderman is a much poorer film, yet that made nearly a billion dollars! and ive already forgotten it! great directors dont make bad movies, just misunderstood ones, and time always shows this........watch out!!",,18 February 2004
An intelligent comic adaptation,"I saw this last night and really enjoyed it.

Ang Lee clearly spent a considerable time trying to craft this comic book material into something more. Hulk's underlying sombre mood and careful character development contrasted nicely with the subsequently ridiculous action and the almost-plastic CGI-powered characters (Mutant French-Poodle anyone?). The occasional comic split-screen shots were novel and appealing.

There were clever little details that would have been lost in most Hollywood blockbusters, such as the quiet nuclear explosion that symbolises the Hulk's mutation. The slow character development in the first half of the movie would have left most young audience bored to death, but was necessary to make us care for the characters.

I give this four stars because: 1. The movie strikes a good balance between ridiculous action and dramatic character development, as all good comics should be. 2. The extremely far-fetched action was very entertaining. 3. Eric Bana and Jennifer Conelly were convincing as scientists. 4. The movie explored the different issues raised by such comic in a more subtle manner than Spiderman and Batman.",,10 July 2003
"Entertaining enough, if you ignore the plot","This film is about a scientist who has an accident in the laboratory. He then is mutated, and gets transformed into a green monster during anger.

For a fantasy adventure action film, ""Hulk"" does an adequate job. The story is delivered in a rather light and comical way. I am impressed by the filmmaker's effort in coming up with such a variety of ways that scenes change from one to another.

The pacing is fast, which is normally a good thing in a big budgeted adventure. However, due to this fast pacing, a lot of things do not get explained well. A lot of things have to be concluded from deduction, such as Bruce's father's experiments and his motives on human testing. As the film approaches its ending, more unexplained things appear. Together with the previous unexplained events, the ending becomes very puzzling.

Fortunately, the special effects are not bad, and the action scenes are thrilling enough. It gives me such an adrenaline rush to see all those cars and roads get wrecked in downtown San Francisco. ""Hulk"" is entertaining and thrilling enough, if you ignore the plot.",,2 October 2008

Good try but ultimately DISAPPOINTING!,"First of all I would like to applaud Ang Lee for having a stab at trying to create a proper 'comic book' film. What you have to remember is Hulk is a comic book character and the way Lee frames certain scenes certainly adds to that feel. It definately is NOT a kids film (Universal and Marvel take note!)

The film is ponderous in places and some of the acting is wildly OTT (the normally dependable Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte is miscast as Banner's father). Jennifer Connelly looks as beautiful as ever and Eric Bana as Bruce Banner is OK given that a lot of the time he is transformed into a raging 20ft CGI monster.

There has been a lot of criticism levelled at the CGI Hulk and for the most part I would agree that ILM have done a good job. However it is nowhere near a 'giant leap' in CGI effects (the T-rex in Jurassic park still looks better and that was done over 10 years ago).

Whether Ang Lee was the right choice as director is open to debate but you have to admire the studio for giving an 'arthouse' director the chance to try to do something different with the comic-book genre. I was expecting so much from this movie but once again left feeling slightly disappointed.

Overall I would rate this film 5 1/2 out of ten",,25 July 2003
Don't hate me because I liked it,"I don't know what all the bitching is about. Is it because the director isn't american? Is it because the Hulk can't seem real with all the technology in the world? Is it because the hype campaign was severely misleading? My guess would be the latter but this isn't the forum. So here's my evaluation...

This is good filmaking, it is good story telling. Not grandiose or revolutionnary, just good.

The Hulk is a psychological drama. Not an action film, not a sci-fi film but a dramatic story about childhood abuse, very bad parenting and what the consequences may be if anyone has a child for all the wrong reasons. Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" and replace the schizophrenia sequences and replace them with The Hulk trying to evade his surroundings so that he doesn't hurt the woman he loves. It has nothing to do with Spiderman, X-Men or The Matrix. What the heck is wrong with that? FX wise, the creature is shown at night or in the dark 90% of the time. In the end its in daylight but it moves so fast its much more spectacular than crappy. Acting wise, aside from the weak interpretation of Eric Bana(he's just waiting to ""explode""), everyone is really good. Jennifer Connely is so pretty and fragile and her work here is both sensitive and with a certain sadness that is just right for the character of Betty Ross. Sam Elliot is always wonderful to see on screen. Sure his roles are all similar but he always pulls it off quite nicely. Give us more of him please! And Nick Nolte could not have been better cast as David Banner. His performance is very powerful all the way through, as always with this great actor.

Everyone who didn't see this film yet has heard or read about the visual style. At first I was taken a bit by surprise. The windows reminded me to much of ""24"" and it was almost like watching TV... But then I figured out this was a ""comic book"" movie... get it? The windows of a comic book? After a while I was waiting to see dialogue bubbles. It was original and well made. Different but nice and refreshing. And lets not forget the transitions between shots and scenes. Everyone of them is different, clever, smart and very impressive.

The Hulk is a well structured, impressively made psychological drama that just tried to also be a hyped Hollywood summer blockbuster, its ONLY flaw. Know what your're really getting into before seeing it and you will enjoy it immensely.",,6 July 2003
Don't bother,"I was very disappointed by The Hulk because it can't decide what kind of movie it is.

Is it a love story? Well, it wants to be: Jennifer Connelly is cast as the beauty who calms the beast. But the first conversation between Bruce Banner and Betsy is about how their relationship had already ended before the movie started. And it doesn't evolve past the beauty-beast thing. Well short of King Kong or Spiderman.

Is it about Hulk The Hero? No. Hulk doesn't really do anything except dodge the military (which may be true to the comic book, but the comic book is a series published over time...not a 2 1/2 hour movie). There's some bizarre battle between him and his evil-villain super-power father toward the end, but I couldn't follow who won the fight and I'm not sure the father's dead.

Is it a psychological/sci-fi thriller? No. The psychology here is so obvious -- despite the movie waiting 2 hours to show you the secret -- that there's no suspense or thrill.

Is it a comic book come to life? It does have a lot of clever, comic-book-inspired visual tricks. But nothing more.

Is it a really long, drawn-out movie with way too many minutes of screen time spent on long CGI chase scenes (when will editors learn to cut some of this stuff out?)? Yes.

On the positive, it's got Jennifer Connelly and Nick Nolte sporting his DUI mugshot hair.

Where women are mere objects to fight over. Or mindless drones that cry for the underdog.

The not so jolly green giant,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs

Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a genetic scientist who one day suffers an accident during an experiment that unfortunately goes wrong and gives him the power to turn into a bulging green giant whenever his angry feelings no longer remain supressed.

This is actually much better than I thought it would be.It's impressive as,right from the start,scenes move from one to the other in the shape and style as though you were reading a comic book right as you watch the film,surely a canny idea from one of the film's producers,Marvel Comics.What it lacks in the way of a coherent,well written plot,it compensates with strong,emphatic performances from it's lead stars,in the shape of Bana,Jennifer Connolley,Sam Elliott and Nick Nolte.This is complimented by some strong,stirring substance and depth,as can be expected from the director of such films as The Ice Storm and Eat Drink Man Woman.

Unfortunately,it kind of overloads a little on this towards the end,causing the movie to become overlong,meander on and feature some unnecessary and boring end footage.However,it's towards the end of the film that the special effects kick in,and they are very good,from the giant hulk monster to watching him grab rotating choppers in the air and toss them like frisbees at cliff tops,other choppers and soforth.And they,were,after all,going to end up being one of,if not the main,selling point of the movie.

Much better than I thought it would be and,believe me,much better than it looks.***",,8 November 2003
The mystery of the pants that refuse to split,"It's easy to dislike The Hulk. We begin with an overly long introduction which presents the ""science"" behind how the Hulk becomes the mutated beast we know and love. This is followed by sappy, oddly acted scenes between a pair of lead actors who seem so disinterested in eachother that the viewer can really care less about what befalls them. So when the Hulk finally appears in all of his mutated glory- green, mean, and extremely pumped- we could really care less about his alter ego, Bruce. Banner is an ineffectual, sniveling scientist who works late hours and somehow manages to break up with fellow scientist Jennifer Connelly- a beautiful, daunting woman who would hardly give such a lout a chance at dating her to in the first place. So the plot is contrived, the acting is haphazard, and the dialogue is stilted. But in the hazy months of summer, where do we turn for solace? To the action of course. And, like any good summer Blockbuster, The Hulk delivers. Though the action scenes occur too seldom, they are not only entertaining but surprisingly humorous. They play like a real comic book. I recommend this movie on the grounds of the action scenes alone. The rest of the film is pure fodder.",,16 July 2003
A Great Movie!,This movie was simply amazing I really like the story and there was a decent amount of action in this movie. When I first saw the previews of the hulk I really had second thoughts about the movie for one it was the look of the unrealistic CGI hulk. I know better now don't judge a movie on looks alone because when I saw the hulk on the big screen. It didn't look as unrealistic as I thought I was impressed on how much detailed was put into this character. It was really awesome and look really convincing. The part that also bother me was the 40 minutes into movie you see the hulk make a appearance. It really didn't bother me much at all a great movie.,,29 June 2003
Great Stuff...for a MOVIE!!!,"OK, there are too many comments, and WAYYYY too many comments from people just saying ""suck suck suck."" So I'm going to do my best to present a different view.

First off, anyone who went to the theater expecting a moviefied version of Bixby/Ferrigno is a fool. Good grief. I liked the TV series too...when I was about 8 years old. I never really got into the comic book myself, but I'm sure it's fine. Overall--is there ANY kind of limit to the entertainment value of an indestructable green giant smashing everything in sight, or is that all you folks wanted?

Second, the visual editing truly is a form-changing step. Sure, split-screen stuff has been done before, but NEVER in a way that really advances the point and feel of the story. This is the first time I've seen the technique applied skillfully, and quite frankly, if it was too much for a viewer to deal with, I'd advise sticking with Looney Tunes.

Third, it's TERRIFIC that the filmmakers managed to construct a movie that does not ""require"" a sense of adolescent nostalgia to enjoy. I've seen the movie several times, I've recommended to friends of mine who have never picked up a comic book, and they've really enjoyed the meaning and value of the work. Why? Because they were open-minded about the presentation and NOT just looking for 100 minutes of a green guy breaking things.

I'll give the movie a 9.5 out of 10. Not so much because it's on par with stuff like Apocalypse Now!, The Third Man, or Star Wars, but because it was a movie that made NO apologies for what it wanted to be. It was envisioned as MORE than a stupid summer action blockbuster, and the filmmakers succeeded. I feel very confident in saying that ""Hulk"" will be something that people will look back on in a decade and say, ""This is actually a pretty good movie,"" in complete contrast to the plot-driven action ""genre"" that Hollywood has been passing off on a market of teenagers for the past few years.

I doubt it'll become the franchise that it deserves to be, but what can you do? There's no way to make a comic-book movie without a large majority of the viewing audience getting the wrong idea, so I really can't fault Universal for applying the same promotion style used for Spiderman and X-men...both enjoyable and entertaining comic-strip movies with absolutely ZERO staying power.

I deduct that last 0.5 point mainly because I thought the end of the Hulk/Partaking-man fight was somewhat underdone. There really could have been a BIT better sense of closure there.",,18 June 2004
"Good acting, amazing special effects, good movie","I watched this film mainly because of Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly, and the exciting action that I knew would be in the film. The acting is good, and the special effects are amazing. Eric Bana plays Bruce Banner quite nicely, showing his struggle to keep the ""monster"" contained but yet loving every second of the freedom and incredibly shown rage that The Hulk is famous for. His scenes with Jennifer Connelly, as Betty, are touching and reminiscent, capturing the frustration and sexual tension and love they have for another and the hard obstacles they need to overcome to become a happy couple. Eric's scenes with Nick Nolte are also powerful, clearly showing the audience of a man who'd made a mistake and created a monster within his own child and yet still wanted to continue hurting the child. All in all, this movie was good. I own it on DVD and enjoy watching the performances given, and the joyful freedom that the Hulk's rage expresses, even though I would personally never p*** off Bruce Banner :)",,8 May 2004

"Big Green Jellybean - not that bad, actually!","THE HULK - Ang Lee

Perhaps it is better that I make clear from the start that this was in my view one of the most unpromising comic book to film transfers. The Hulk as a character is essentially the stuff of B-movie productions from the atomic era, a poor man's Jekyll and Hyde with none of the sophistication of R.L. Stevenson's creation. Given the scope of the material at hand, director Ang Lee puts up a surprisingly decent show, hands-down beating the rubbish that Sam Raimi slopped out in the undeservingly successful 'Spiderman', but there are enough flaws and gaping holes in the film's fabric to hold the hurrahs. The comics depict the Hulk originating from an atomic explosion, when brilliant nuclear scientist Bruce Banner is mutated by radiation from the blast to transform into an ugly green giant whenever he goes ballistic. In the film this is, like everything in the 21st century, transformed into a case of transgenic mutation, though the plot cleverly puts the onus of the experiment on his father, David Banner (interestingly, in the TV series on the Hulk, his alter ego was called David Banner). The film portrays David Banner as an unbalanced scientist who is bent on improving nature as he sees it, in the process experimenting on himself and transferring his altered genes to his son Bruce. His career is derailed by the military's General Ross who is later on involved in the capture of the Hulk for use as a living weapon by the army The Hulk is less action blockbuster and more character drama. The script sets up some very interesting archetypes, most notably Bruce's father, for what could have been another cheap wrestlers-in-tights movie, but, although a large amount of footage is devoted to dialog and exposition, is found deficient in providing them with sufficient depth. Lee uses some very intelligent techniques to tell his story - split screens and comic-book style paneling of shots pay tribute to the character's roots without taking away from the somber style of the narrative. Eric Bana plays Bruce Banner with lethal dullness for almost the entire movie except the climax where he breaks down before his megalomaniac dad. Nick Nolte's portrayal of the psychologically unsound David Banner goes from engaging to overblown. Jennifer Connelly is nice if rather limited in the role of the general's daughter Betty Ross, who also happens to be Bruce's colleague and beau. One of the main problems with the movie comes with the on-screen depiction of the Hulk. With all the technical wizardry and CGI effects powering this effort, the Hulk comes off looking like a giant-sized rubber doll at best and sometimes rather less than that (The TV series avoided this whole shindig by putting in another character, bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno, to do the big green bit). Some of his adversaries, like the monster-ified dogs, look downright campy and ridiculous, making for the most embarrassing action sequences ever shot. But things get rather better when the film shifts to the (Nevada?) desert where Bruce, being held captive by the military, transforms into the Hulk and escapes. The excellent desert footage is accompanied by some very unusual-for-a-movie-of-this-type music - excellent Indian Classical vocal melodies set to an electronic beat. The climax is left open-ended for a sequel, not something that I'm too cheerful about. Some of the film's failures lie with its limitations as a movie clearly intent on sequels and merchandise - so the Hulk can never be portrayed as a true monster, capable of causing damage and hazard to the innocent, which makes him all the less interesting as a character.",,22 June 2003
Come on guys,"What's all the negative hype about?

Music's good - looks good and it moves. That's a movie is it not?

Everything aside - what I liked (in a manner appropriate for one who knows they are watching a film about a comic book monster) was the embedded essay on what we inherit from our fathers; the realisation that, no matter what the dangers might be 'out there', the biggest struggle we will ever face is to overcome what is passed on to us from our parents.

This struggle climaxed I felt in the wonderful visual of the father-son fight in the clouds; father as lightning, son as monster. Here they were, locked in struggle, their turmoil evident yet only visible, perceivable, in brief flashes amid vapor: a good movie realisation of the times we find ourselves enraged by our parental inheritance and yet unable to frame or grasp exactly what it is and where it comes from. This was the real plot in the film - mirrored in both Banner's life and the female lead. It was their relationship with each other that proved most disappointing.

Good CGI - don't like CGI? Don't watch and expect to like. Suitable plot/script. Want something really meaty? Read Shakespeare.

Well done Ang Lee.",,3 December 2004
nothing to truly marvel at in this disappointing comic book saga,"Miscalculated comic book saga has a good setup but is done in by poor execution. Bana is a promising scientist with an ambiguous and troubled past that he can't recollect. He's blissfully ignorant of the fact that his unstable genetics and pent up rage and aggression can transform him into a fierce green monster with a fast temper and an appetite for destruction. An unconventional approach to comic book material, long on destructive action scenes and convoluted science the film is certainly well-crafted, but fails to overcome its obvious flaws: Bana is miscast (not really for his acting but more for his physical appearance), the special effects are totally unremarkable, the story is never fully fleshed out, and after a while Lee's innovative direction becomes a gimmick--not to mention a distraction. Nolte however, does manage to make the most of his role as Bana's shadowy father. **",,20 June 2003
"not very good, pity.","I have fond memories about the Hulk when it was on tv. This movie

is a big disappointment. The story begins great then after 10 or 15

minutes the pace slows down and becomes boring until the Hulk

shows up. I enjoyed the special effects, but I think it could've used

more humor. The jumping over the mountains is just silly.

making it stronger. A better example of perfect split screen use is

No Nick Nolte!,This movie would have been great without Nick Nolte. He added only time to this movie. The Bruce Banner character was just plain stupid and Nick Nolte was his usual self.

CGI Hulk's size,"Hey all! Just saw the film was impressed!! The CGI was pretty damn good! Right down to pores on his skin, freckles, etc. The only 2 things I question are: As per he Hulk's size,I know that in the Marvel comics, The original Hulk we all know & love was listed as being 7 feet tall and weighing 1,040 lbs. To me, that would have sufficed enough right there as far as I'm concerned. (He's at least twice that size here) Also, the thing which made the Hulk unique was that he was able to increase his strength (via his anger/rage) WITHOUT any additional mass/size gain!! How large will this Hulk become? He seemed to already be heading toward King Kong size!! Also, I wish he spoke a bit more!! It was, however, cool to hear him sound simply like a big guy growling out of rage & not some kind of bear/lion/dinosaur hybrid!! (Wish he would have said at least one ""Hulk Smash!"" LOL!! And no Rick Jones!)In fact, he was realistically portrayed looking kind of like a green, muscle bloated Eric Bana. My second problem was with what happened to Lou Ferrigno; He was simply cast as an extra!! I think it would have been cooler to have had big Lou at least as one of the soldiers, with more to do than simply walking along side Stan Lee (who at least had a line or 2 while walking with Lou)! All in all, however, I must say that the film rocked& was enjoyable! Go see it! You won't be disappointed much at all!!",,22 June 2003

Don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.,"Sadly, despite my highest hopes, this film made me angry.

Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" could've been the blockbuster the size of ""Spider-Man"" and wound up being disappointing, much like ""Batman and Robin"".

The acting was good, the writing was okay, and the CG was excellent. What killed the movie were those dumb comic-book-type panels that kept appearing on the screen. I was cringing in my seat everytime I saw one. Why? Because they take away from the reality of the film. Every self-respecting filmmaker knows that these should be avoided like the Black Plague.

I thought that the movie excelled when those panels left the screen and the standard ""cut"" and ""dissolve"" transitions were used. They were prominent in the scenes where the Hulk was on screen. Contrary to what most people think, I liked the way the Hulk looked. It finally gave Stan Lee's vision of the Hulk (a HUGE monster) life.

So think what you will of ""Hulk"", just watch it at your own risk. Meanwhile, I'm gonna go watch ""Matrix: Reloaded"" again.",,15 August 2003
Not as bad as I'd thought it would be,"My expectations were pretty low for this film after reading all the negative reviews. Perhaps that accounts for the fact that I actually found this watchable. However, that doesn't mean that it's good or that it isn't flawed. The following is an attempt to break down what is wrong with this picture.

The Origin: The movie sticks to the comic book origin, with some significant changes. In the comics, we get an alcoholic, insane father, who heaps all sorts of abuse on Bruce Banner and ends up killing his mother in a fit of drunken rage (this revelation, incidentally, was introduced relatively late in the Hulk's run; mid 80s or so). Ultimately, he ends up being the reason for the Hulk's existence (besides the obvious reason, of course). The movie keeps to that premise but changes it significantly by making the father an egomaniacal genius, with designs on playing God by endeavoring to create a race of supermen (or something) and whose experiments on Bruce (and himself) end up as being the reason for being the Hulk. I can see the reason for wanting to change the father from an abusive bastard to a mad scientist. For one thing, the film would be too dark if it contained a story about child abuse. For another, it provides a built-in supervillain for the film, where it might otherwise take too much time to introduce an entirely new character to serve as villain. However, whereas in the comic book, the brilliant revelation that Bruce's father's abuse was the core of the Hulk's endless rage and limitless strength, the movie's explanations are quite vague. There is little indication of why Bruce Banner is so angry inside. Except for the fact that he tries to kill Bruce with a knife (because he wants to end his ""experiment"" before it becomes the Hulk) he is shown to be a pretty decent dad. The fact that he accidentally kills his wife instead is the repressed memory Bruce retains throughout the film and presumably the reason for his ""endless rage."" But it doesn't seem strong enough a motive to me. For one thing, the death of his mother was an accident. For another, even though the father did actually try to kill HIM, Bruce seemed rather too young and too shocked to understand what was going on; far too young and too docile to hold a grudge. So the attempt on his life doesn't seem like a strong enough reason for ""endless rage"" either. To digress here for a moment, the very idea that David Banner would grab a knife to slaughter his son itself seems to me far-fetched. His character, mad scientist that he may have been, didn't strike me as having what it takes to be a homicidal maniac (and what was being said behind the closed door? Was David explaining to his wife that he had to kill their son? ""Uh, honey, I know this is gonna be hard to take, but I gotta go off the kid cause I like messed him up inside with my experiments and now he's gonna turn into the Hulk."" Whatever). Also, one might think if he really needed to kill the boy, he wouldn't waste time explaining things to his wife. I would like to think he wouldn't use a knife, either and instead find some more euphemistic means of committing murder. Anyway, brilliant as the movie origin may seem at first, it clearly falls apart at the end and doesn't provide any sort of sound basis for the movie.

The Science: The movie wastes far too much time with shots of scientific formulas and single-celled things and such. I don't know why these scenes are being shown or who will appreciate them. All I know is that they do nothing but make the film longer than it needs to be. Too much time is spent explaining the biological reason for the Hulk's being, which would be tolerable if any of it was comprehensible. But it's not. It's all vague, pseudoscientific jargon. To borrow a line from MST3K, ""blah, blah, technocrap, blah.""

The CGI: Much better than I'd thought it would be. All the trailers and clips seemed to suggest it would suck horribly. However, I was quite surprised that the Hulk, though clearly not lifelike, was solid enough to suggest he was really occupying space. And his facial movements seemed believable enough. The scenes pitting the Hulk against the U.S. army were very entertaining. One thing that bothered me, however (and this has less to do with the quality of CGI, of course), was the Hulk's size. What's up with the gigantic Hulk? It's ""the angrier Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets"" not ""the angrier Hulk gets the BIGGER and stronger Hulk gets."" He's the Hulk, not Giant-Man.

The Cast: Not very well fleshed out, especially General Ross and his daughter, Betty Ross. They're estranged but we have no idea why and the film seems to have no interest in explaining. Well, if the film isn't interested, neither am

I. Then there's the lead. Not much for this guy to do except to mouth his lines and act all spaztic when it's time to become the Hulk. Not much there to be interested in. As for Glenn Talbot, even comic books don't have villains this ridiculous. Well, OK they do, but you wouldn't expect to see one in a movie that takes itself as seriously as this one does. Way over-the-top, this guy; I was surprised he didn't laugh evilly after zapping Bruce Banner with a tazer (he came close, though). Josh Lucas seems to be making up for everyone else underplaying their parts by overplaying his. Finally, there's Bruce's dad, the raving lunatic scientist, played by Nick Nolte. Honestly, I can't say I found anything wrong with Nolte's performance. The character himself was kind of annoying but Nolte did a pretty solid job.",,8 December 2003
Fragmented movie...hoping Hulk II is better,,,23 June 2003
Not good at all,"I would not recommend this movie to watch. I found this movie too slow. Although the special effects were good but it lacked story and substance.

I was disappointed when i watched this movie after so much hype. It could have been made much better.",,30 July 2003
Not as good as X-Men 2 but btter then X-Men 1,"First off, I knew kinda what to expect becuase of Director Ang Lee. He is very good with action sequences but then equally good with telling a story. eeing as how the movie was 2hrs and 18min, I had a feeling that it would not one long chase to stop the Hulk as I though it was going to be (and really wanted it to be). However, Ang Lee managed to keep you entertained with scenes that normally wouldn't be entertaining at all. In a way, it is like a story told for people with ADD becuase there is always some image moving, changing size, resulting in a very good movie impression of the comic book design. Of course one of the big issues with this movie is that it takes a long time for Bruce Banner to finally turn into the Hulk. That is true, but it almost makes The Hulks appearance that more climatic, basically, it is well worth the wait to see the Hulk. Speaking of which, the CGI Hulk is very impressive. Thye two most memorable scenes, which is why the movie is worth seeing, is the fight bewtween Hulk and the mutant dogs (which turned out much better then I thought it was) and the Hulk fighting the entire U.S. Army (I dont know how they did the tanks being demolished but it looked amazing). Whats even more impressive about the Hulk is that this big green CGI monster is able to make you feel sorry for it, it does a better job then Eric Bana. Of course, the movie is very ironic becuase you have all of these comic book movies, and the Matrix, in which there are great spectacles but not really full of emotion and then there is a movie about a guy who turns big a green when he gets angry and the CGI monster is the character that makes it emotionally moving, in fact that CGI monster had more human qualities then pretty much the entire cast of the Matrix (and I am talking about the cast that has to play humans. However, the ending is a little lack luster. It seems the onyl reason becuase that is the only they felt that Bruce banner would be able to escape. I mean the Absorbing man is a interesting Idea but they should have saved that for the sequal or had the escape be more sneaky instead of so over the top. Again, the only aspect that saved that scene was the Hulk. Im serious when I say that the HUlk deserves an oscar for his performance.",,22 June 2003
Bit of a postscript.,"There will no doubt be a few people who regard this movie as unrealistic and depressing. Unrealistic? Perhaps. Depressing? Newflash: that's how it was meant to be! At least, partially. In fact, Stan Lee (former Marvel editor-in-chief) says that was the basic concept for the comic book, in the first place. A tragic figure who's like a cross between Jekyll & Hyde and the Frankenstein Monster! Don't believe me? Just read any graphic novel compilation that reprints the Hulk's earliest Silver Age adventures. Especially those that were illustrated by Jack ""the (Once and Future) King"" Kirby!",,21 June 2003
Lots of ground breaking in fx lacking in heart,"The thing I found after leaving the theater after seeing The Hulk was that I really never cared for either Bruce Banner or the Hulk. Sure the film cut the edge with CGI and I was pleased to see the stylish editing which I felt worked well for the material, however, I never really found myself invested in the characters. I would recommend this film for the artistry that went into the visual style, but go to the early show and save a few bucks. It's not worth full price.",,21 June 2003
Bewildered,It's kind of sad to see the letdown reactions in the theater as the credits rolled. My personal opinions were that the directing was fuzzy and that Jennifer Connelly and Josh Lucas can't be the only ones taking care of the acting end of the movie. The performance of the actors were very unbalanced at times. I commend Jennifer Connelly for holding her own. :),,20 June 2003
Passafist Reviews The Hulk,"I sit here in utter shock. SHOCK! I have just seen the worst movie I have ever set my eyes on. You're right it's probably just that it's a new experience. I mean I've seen many bad movies. Most of them have some endearing qualities. Ang Lee's (The Ice Storm) THE HULK does not. It's pretentious, stupid, banal, trite, awful, horrible, vomit inducing, and many other choice words. It's a grade-A suckfest. It's so bad it's unwatchable.

In the beginning I thought maybe this movie had some potential. Sure, I walked in with low expectations. I expected neat action sequences, maybe a little love story, some neat if hokey special effects; A popcorn movie, with ANG LEE at the helm maybe a little substance. What I got was a disjointed, amateurish, and plotless mess of a film.

Eric Bana (Black Hawk Down) stars as Bruce Banner, a scientist, who will eventually turn into a big green monster, like SHREK without the sarcastic wit. Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind) plays Betty Ross the other scientist, the pretty one who loves Bruce, but how can you love SHREK. They're working on some pointless experiment that explodes a toad. There is also a guy trying to steal the research and the girl, his name is Talbot (Josh Lucas, Sweet Home Alabama) and he's a jerk. Nick Nolte (Blue Chips) is there as Bruce's estranged and nutszoid father, and Sam Elliott is Betty's estranged and bi-polar father.

Bruce Banner turns green and jumps around a lot while helicopters chase him. Betty broods around a lot, she loves him, but how can she love the Jolly Green Giant. Her father can't make up his mind, one minute he's pissed off at the Hulk another minute he feels sad for him. Stan Lee (Daredevil) and Lou Ferrigno (TV's The Incredible Hulk) give Oscar worthy support as bad actors, oops I mean security guards. Oh yeah, and Nick Nolte acts crazy a lot.

You know what's funny. None of this can be blamed on the actors. The blame is squarely on the director, the screenwriter and the editor.

First of all, the movie uses a crappy gimmick, the split-screen. I think my favorite split screen was the one Truffaut used in FAHRENHEIT 451, where the screen splits and there's a black screen on one side. That was really deep. Or maybe my favorite one was in THE PARENT TRAP, I really believed Haley Mills was two girls.

It's intent is to make the film look more like a comic book. But in reality I make the film it look really, really sloppy. The split screen makes it like they are covering up mistakes. There are scenes that are wooden; there are scenes in this film where you can tell that the characters are not talking to each other. This is filmmaking 101 ANG LEE, go back to film school buddy.

Not only that, the story has no tone. One minute everything is dark and brooding, the next minute everything is colorful. There is an underground military base in this film that looks like Dr. Evil's Lair in AUSTIN POWERS, hey ANG LEE you have millions to make a movie hire a decent art director.

Yeah and why not hire graphic artists that can make the Hulk freaking walk. Instead of jumping around like the earth is one giant moonwalk.

John Turman (TV's Crow: Stairway To Heaven) and Michael France's (Cliffhanger) screenplay lacks any character's. Every motivation is simply to move the story along. The Hulk is powerful only when the screenplay calls him to be. There is a moment where they spray him with some freezing goop, sure he can lift a whole mountain off of himself but it takes him 2 minutes to break through goop, and Bruce Banner isn't a softy when the movie let him, but he can't beat up a guy in a cast. I couldn't believe it.

And, Poor Jennifer Connelly, she has the most amazing expressive face, and all Ang Lee can have her do is brood, and cry. Let the poor girl smile you dehumanizing jackass. Let the girl smile.

And finally, if I see one more pointless fight scene during the night. A scene that is only shot in the darkness to cover up the fact that very little is happening. I will get angry and probably turn into the Hulk myself.

On a postive note there is a shot. One shot where Jennifer Connelly is swinging on a swing. It's a beautiful shot in the middle of a mess.

Thank you for the chance to vent. The Hulk is a heaping Hulk of elephant dung mixed with dog vomit.",,23 June 2003
DON'T MAKE HIM ANGRY...PLEASE!!!,"After the disappointing DareDevil movie with Ben Affleck, Ang Lee's The Hulk certainly helps to give the comic superhero movie industry a much needed boost.

The hulk in this movie is much more faithful to the one in the comic books, being over 10 feet tall and getting bigger when he gets angrier.

Josh Lucas and Nick Nolte both do very well in their roles as the movie's main slimeballs, Glen Talbot and Bruce Banner's not-so-innocent father David Banner. It may be hard to like Sam Elliot's character of General Ross, but we can obviously see a man who is torn between defending his daughter and his country and saving the son of the man who caused the destruction of his army base.

The transformation scenes are amazing. The transformation which made Bill Bixby turn into Lou Ferrigno in the TV series was great too, but it pales in comparison to this!

One thing in this movie I dislike is the portrayal of the U.S. Army. It seems they shoot at anything that moves, whether it's guilty or innocent. Makes you think how some people in Afghanistan and Iraq are feeling right now.

The Hulk is a must-see for anyone, even those who don't like comic books or superheroes.

Look closely for cameos by Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno as security guards!

See you at the box office!",,23 June 2003
It was ok,"Some people complained about the CGI in this film and while it does obviously look like CGI, the Hulk is a comic book character and I think it's fine that he looks that way. My two problems with this film are the climax to the movie where all common sense goes out the window to allow Bruce and his dad to be together for the big battle at the end. There was also two much back story which really slowed the movie down to the point where I started cracking MST3K jokes (good thing it was the late showing). Another annoying thing was the inconsistent use of the split screen which at times showed the same person just from a different angle. The battle in the desert was pretty good. I'd allow a sequel if the contract banned the use of the split screen.",,22 June 2003
But I bet you liked Charlies Angels...,"... for it's in depth, artistic indulgence for cinema, right? People who say ""Hulk"" is a load of crap are full of it themselves. Sure, it was slower and done differently as compared to some of the other, action-packed comic book movies, but give me a break. The back-story was a necessary tool in developing the persona of Banner -- for this I'm sure many of you became tired and annoyed because Big Bad Greenie wasn't on the screen breaking things within five minutes -- and in turn giving a reason as to why he is ""Hulk."" Also, when he did become ""Hulk,"" what is the fuss over the CGI?? In the trailer, I questioned the CGI like many others did, but after seeing the film, I would praise the CGI as some of the best I've seen (Gollum comes to mind.) He's definitely no ""Scooby-Doo"" or ""Harry Potter,"" and I would say he beats the fight scene ""Matrix Reloaded"" praises itself on between Neo and all the Agent Smiths, if nothing else than pure visual believability. My opinion on people not liking this movie is that it was too involved and Hulk was not the monster they wanted him to be. Granted, the pace was lacking in the start, but the film wasn't. I enjoyed the editing, the story and the acting. And I have to say, despite the unoriginal opening credits (same as ""Spiderman"" same as ""X-men""...) the opening sequence to ""Hulk"" was very well done. Overall, I would give Hulk an above average rating, 8.",,1 July 2003
Only the Last Half Was Good,"Oh the first half was so slow and boring. i can see why they did it, to build up the movie. But i notice any intro movie is boring: ie: XMen 1, The Hulk, etc. Just get to it! There wasn't a lot of depth to the characters. Some of the action scenes were good. The hulk looks like he's made of green rubber. Hee hee hee.",,12 July 2003
"Origin good, plot bad, Hulk okay",,,25 June 2003
Hulk no smash,"Utter and unadulterated smeg. The first hour of this movie i spent trying to stave off slipping into a coma, but on second thoughts it would've been more enjoyable if I had. This movie could've done with being an hour shorter, or not being made all together. Long, incoherant over-dramatic scenes sucked any fun that could've been had, and I almost had the urge to walk out, but I was so bored stiff i couldn't summon up the energy to leave, I suppose I was holding out for it to get better, I was disappointed, The movie has *some* redeeming features, Hulk wasn't nearly as bad as i'd pictured him to be, indeed the scenes with the great green lug were the only interesting parts of the movie, even though the dog-fight (pun intended) in Betty's yard was also over-stretched and would've done being a couple minutes shorter, also I don't remember Hulk being able to bounce superhuman distances the size of counties to get away from the army, but as I was never a great fan of the comics I could've been mistaken.

It matters little, Ang Lee was trying to give this comic-book adaptation class with an arty feel, but it simply sucked all entertainment out of it, trying to be overly sensitive and dramatic and failing miserably. The long expositional scenes were dull and you end up not really caring about the characters which is the exact opposite from what Mr Lee was aiming for i'd imagine. Hulk was the only star of the show, because enjoyment could be found with the green machine smashing up things until he had worn his rage out, probably frustration garnered from being stuck in an overly long, tiresome movie with only about 15 minutes of screen time altogether.

Hulk doesn't actually show up until halfway through the movie and his angry grunting and smashing is a welcome relief from the arty mumbo-jumbo. Eric Bana does a good job as Bruce Banner, even though confusing dream sequences and flashbacks tend to drag the movie even more, he acts it well and believably as a man who has been repressing a deep trauma and betrayal by his dad and has great trouble expressing himself emotionally-quite understandably- though he does spend a lot of time shaking with rage which i suppose is to be expected. Hulk tries to be different from the other mainstream comic book movies of the past years -all of which I have loved, especially X-men and even Daredevil- but it ended up failing to impress or entertain and just bored and disappointed me, it's a good thing I didn't go into the cinema with high expactations because they would've been suitably crushed, I advise you not to either.",,13 July 2003
"Like the comic book character, severely misunderstood.","1. For the people who say that the Hulk was unrealistic, I'd like to know exactly what you would have changed to make him look realistic. That's going to be something of a challenge for a being that doesn't exist in reality.

2. Hulk is NOT a super-hero. This is a huge misconception. From issue 1, the Hulk has always been a tragic character (not counting when he led the Pantheon in the mid 90's). In the early days, the only reason he fought villains like the Metal Master, Abomination, and the Leader is because they attacked him first. He fought in self-defense, and he only saved humans from the villains because he wasn't a killer himself. My point is, since he's not a super-hero, this isn't a super-hero action movie. Hulk was never meant to be like that.

3. As for the various departures from the comics (and anyone who's seen it knows which ones I'm talking about), I have three words for you: DEAL WITH IT. All of the Marvel movies have had departures, some greater than others.

4. Personally, the comic book panels didn't bother me. I'll admit, they were odd at first, but for me it only added to the action. 5. And finally, a comment that goes beyond the scope of this movie. In the past several years people have lost sight of a very important fact about our society, and people in general: everyone has different tastes. If you didn't like this movie, who are you to say that it was bad? Yes, there are some genuinely awful movies out there, but those movies don't make a tenth of the money that Hulk made. If Hulk can make $130 million, then there's got to be something good about it, right?

Criticism has its place, but lately it has been taken to such extremes that it can no longer be taken seriously. If you wish to say that this movie sucks, fine. I personally think LotR, Star Wars, and Harry Potter are garbage. But it goes without saying that they're extremely popular, so it seems obvious to me that they are considered good movies by some people.

I liked Hulk more than I liked any of the other Marvel movies (although I have liked them all so far, on one level or another). I'm a huge Spider-Fan (I stuck through the entire Clone Saga), and while I thought the movie was okay I think it could have been better. Personal taste must be taken into consideration before blasting a movie. Otherwise, you come off as biased and unworthy of any consideration whatsoever.

Okay Film,"The Hulk tells the story of Bruce Banner who is accidently exposed to high amounts of gamma radiation. He then turns into a monster called The Hulk. The military is after him,but so is his mad father. I loved the direction Ang Lee took. But the hulk is a bit too powerful. I know he has limitless power,but sometimes the movie goes over board. It is fun,but sometimes can have some boring scenes. See the old Bill Bixby ones instead. But this is still good.

I thought the actors could have portayed them better, but they would in turn need a better story to act out.

that Lee was the most versatile director working today. His filmic range, like his intelligence and curiosity, seems to know no bounds.

One thing was for certain: Ang Lee would make a super-hero movie like nothing we'd seen before.

That is certainly true.

Ironically, Ang Lee's desire to do something different has brought about the

familiar: for the first time, a comic book movie LOOKS like a comic book. The optical effects, boxes, wipes and mesh effects are truly (forgive the pun)

Marvelous. Comic book artists have long known how to create movement, depth

and multiple dimensions on a static page: Lee has exploded this sensibility into the cinematic realm.

Ang Lee has taken a great many chances with this film. In addition to the

sometimes brilliant, sometimes distracting comic book visuals, he also delays the metamorphosis deep into the movie, asking us to live off the characters'

emotions.

Ang Lee took big, wild chances on this film, and I respect him for it.

Unfortunately, those chances don't pay off with an entertaining movie. There are many reasons why.

Let's start with casting. First, there's Eric Bana. He's just plain bland. He's also playing against Jennifer Connolly, who is undeniably beautiful, but her painfully serious tone takes this movie, which already takes itself too seriously, right over the edge into grating pretense. Nick Nolte hits all the wrong notes, and one gets the tickling suspicion that the hair stylist didn't have to touch Nolte's head when he showed up for work every morning. He's already that freaky.

The script, alas, falls short. That was a surprise to me, given that James

Schamus, Ang Lee's longtime collaborator, has a credit on the film. The Hulk's outbursts are never very clearly motivated. The villains are hackneyed (how

many times have we seen the evil Government antagonists? Wargames?

Starman? Outbreak? The list goes on and on...), but worse than that, they are stupid and redundant. This movie makes its protagonist the most ignorant guy in the room when it comes to the plot. We feel like we're spending the whole two hours plus waiting for Bruce to GET IT. Sprinkle in some preachy, over-the- top speeches about the evil military, which clank and thud right about now, and you've got a pretty lame screenplay.

As I said earlier, I admire this director, and this movie, for the chances they take. If you're going to fail, fail big. I guess it's nice to see that Ang Lee is human, because it makes me respect his successes all the more.

But in the pantheon of his creative endeavors, this Hulk will be a miniscule little blip.",,29 June 2003
"It looks like a dog, it barks like a dog...","This film would have been happier at Crufts than our local cinema! Following a lab accident mild-mannered scientist Dr Bruce Banner turns into... a bad cgi. The film was excruciatingly slow, the acting wooden, special effects unexciting and the fight sequences ludicrous. The science was pretty dodgy too! - drop something very heavy from the edge of space and it goes ""sploosh""? Where was the tsunami? Where was the crater? After an hour people started leaving the cinema - something I haven't seen in a while. The audience was restless and chatting, laughing at some of the more ridiculous sequences. Ang Lee can do better than this, but I've seldom seen him do worse! The only good feature was Danny Elfman's music - and even that couldn't redeem the worst film I'm seen in a long while (and I did see Daredevil and Spiderman!)",,23 July 2003
A disappointing visual creation on screen...,"Again, for the past 4 movies I've watched on the big screen, I was influenced by ratings posted left and right on the net. Not my review, no, but to actually walk to the theatre and watch it. Especially that hulk fans were satisfied with the movie (myself not a fan), I just thought this film must have justified its comic origins. Then I heard the hulk will be completely CGI, that's when I began to have doubts... will it look real? If so, will we then feel it is? But since I've witnessed the visual creations in the likes of dobby, yoda, and of course gollum, those doubts seem to vanish until...

Fueled by the high ratings fants gave this movie, I ended up in the theatre watching this film. The opening was excellent and the story development (at least initially) was engaging. Of course every viewer is expecting to witness the hulk anytime soon and it all the more gets exciting. I was thrilled with the moments leading to the final transformation. The ""comic cuts and boxes"" style was distracting mind you. A no-no for me. Anyway, the metamorphosis was finally unfolding before my eyes but wait, what happened? The final product was a disappointing visual- the hulk looked and worst, felt fake! Oh no. Where was the yoda and gollum wizardry?

As if we were not fed enough with this purported state-of-the-art computer creation, suddenly hulk is seen jumping at great heights, from mountain peak to mountain peak! I was almost drowning in having to suspend my disbelief although I know very well that I went to see a movie adopted from comics. As Cate Blanchet put it, ""much that once was, is lost"" in the ensuing 1/2 of the film. And now, for the grand finale, the ending was the most aweful part. The dad-and-son fighting scene was so obviously artificially included just to keep the reel running for a few more minutes. Good lord, I just had enough.

In faireness, the acting was great. The music was fitting. But that's about it? Could I forgive the CGI? With this age of hi-tech wizardry, no. If so, could the story, acting and music save the movie? Not quite. Therefore, a 2.5/4 for average.",,9 July 2003
Solid effor seriously let down by lack of humour,"The idea of taking a popular character like the Incredible Hulk and turning it into a motion picture is certainly a viable idea. The TV series took the Marvel Comics superhero and imbued with a gentle tragedy and pathos amidst all the special effects. It was more than conceivable that a similiar result could have been achieved on the big screen. Sadly this has not fully transpired. True, the dramatic material is in place but what the film lacks is any kind of humour or quirky edge to complement the more serious material. The result is a largely boring film that is only really livened up by the appearance of it's eponymous hero.

Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a very troubled young man. A lengthy build-up sequence shows how he was experimented upon by his misguided military scientist father (who evolves into a dishevelled Nick Nolte). As an adult, he works in a genetics laboratory and after a freak accident the results of his father's abuse steadly begin to take effect...

Nearly everyone in this film is stone cold sober and highly one-dimensional. Eric Bana makes a decidedly unmemorable Bruce Banner, not delivering either the humour or emotional range to make the audience believe in him. His romance with Jennifer Connelly, as his love interest, lacks chemistry and the story loses much of it's poignancy as a result. Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot, as General Ross, suffer similiar problems as the Hulk's chief adversaries, neither one charismatic enough to be a convincing villain.

The script, to the credit of the writers, takes the character and his background very seriously, more so than most other movies of its kind would. The problem is they have removed a key ingredient from what essentially a fantasy film: humour. Recent films such as ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" have taken their characters seriously whilst not forgetting to add a humourous edge to their predicaments. Nothing of the kind is present in ""Hulk"", meaning many of the dramatic scenes either drag or feel hopelessly padded out.

Technically, the film is superb. The main feature, the computer-generated Hulk, is lively and cartoony, although a few changes have been made to the creature's powers. It is now fifteen feet tall (still able to fit into it's one size fits all pants), absorbs bullets and can practically fly, leaping miles in single bound. The action scenes set in the desert and the science lab are exciting and enjoyable, although the finale in San Francisco could have been a bit more destructive than it is.

A solid effort, to be fair, with some enjoyable action. Let's hope the sequel, if there is one, ups the ante on humour and action to balance out some of the more dramatic stuff.",,5 August 2003
Seriously underrated.,"The Hulk, well almost everybody knows about this giant green. But one should understand that comic book adaptations to cinema industry will turn the book into a single 40 page script which follows:

a)who is he? b)what he does? c)what in the name of God happened to him so that he became an extraordinary being? d)and let's choose a story/villain from the series and add s***load of CG.

So from this point of view, Hulk is a perfect comic book adaptation.So I won't review the book but the movie which has a very little relation with the comic.

So to really understand the value of the movie one should look deep inside.

Hulk is no hero. Actually he is a pain in the butt. He is a disaster, a genetic accident, son of a mad scientist and green. So he is not around to save the day, and he actually never saves it, except the thing with those mutant dogs, but that doesn't count as they are not the villain.

But we pity Bruce and accept him as a hero. Well he is supernatural. He is in pain, lost his family, working on a errornous project, then an accident and when he loses his tamper he suddenly requires new clothes yada yada..But on the other hand the Army is trying to capture him, as well as his own father.

When we check the cast: Eric Bana, great guy, loved him, in some scenes he really makes you feel his own situation. Jennifer Connely, well pretty lady but she didn't do much in the movie. Nick Nolte? What a surprize but this guy was awesome, best in the movie, he was perfect.Sam Elliott, great selection and also does well.Rest of the cast is also fine.

FX&CGI: Not even a question! ILM baby! It is a sin to insult effects in this movie, and I mean it. Nothing more to say, perfect.

But, the story. Well, I think this disturbs a little. Till the middle, fine. We see Hulk is being set free, fine. But like a dog he sniffs the location of the girl, well a little confusing. Then bad guys capture to drill him, as expected. Then he runs and we see some good action, fine. But after that, it all gets mixed up. The last fight between father and son was a total confusion. Why? Well it is a good ending but when you are filled with action and emotion it ends with the ""Neo"" stile.Not bad but confusing.

What we have? Fine cast, great effects and at least a better adaptation then other comic books -Spider Man? Get off my ship!- with some fancy transitions between scenes and also great music (did I mention that?); Which makes one spend some good time in the cinema. What else can be done, I ask all the time and I cannot find an answer. This movie is not ""maximum extreme"" but it gives the best that it can give, which is unfortunately not a ""Top 250"" performance, but also not a ""worst movie ever!"" or ""This sucks!"" performance. This is a movie that should be remembered as ""fine"" and ""7.5/10""",,26 June 2004
I'm with David Edelstein on this stinker,"I usually agree with Roger Ebert's reviews but this time I sure didn't. He must have seen a different film than I did. ""The Hulk"" is one of the most unpleasant and unentertaining movies I have ever suffered through. It lacks fun (except for the two-second Lou Ferrigno cameo). The computer-generated ""hero"" is lifeless and uninteresting. There's no real plot, no dramatic tension, and the characters' motivations make about as much sense as the Hulk's magically enlarging shorts. The story is nonsensical and unengaging, the pace is jerky and large chunks are just dead on the screen. (I admit the killer poodle was a good joke, though.) No doubt there's an exciting story in here (it worked once on TV, after all) and maybe someday someone will film it. But definitely, no CGI, no pretentious split-screen effects, and (pleaaaaase!), a real story, a plot with a point, and characters with at least 2 dimensions each.",,30 June 2003
The Hulk Review (from the press screening on June 2nd),"Hi,

I'm not going to go more in depth than to say that as a life long Hulk fan (comics, tv, cartoon, everything) this was the film that I've always wanted to see, and urge everyone to wait just a bit longer and see in the cinema, as it was meant to be seen. You will not be dissapointed. The film was excellent, and I am eagerly waiting to see it again and again once it opens.

I know the wait is longer for those overseas, and I know it sucks, I'm sorry. Hopefully more movies will follow the trend of X2 and have a global release date.

"Not what you think, but better","Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" is one of the most true-to-form movies based on a comic book that I've ever had the chance to see. It's dramatic, it has depth and warmth, and the characters are believeable enough to be convincing. Add to the mix some of the better actors of this generation, and a directing style that helps tell the story more effectively, and you've got one hell of a good movie.

The first thing about The Hulk that surprised me was the editing. Ang Lee has created a living, breathing comic book. Every shot, every line of dialogue, every angle, every split-screen and panel-screen shot is created to give the viewer a feel like they're actually watching a comic book come to life. Lee's method is effective without being distracting, and in some scenes this effect even helps add to the emotion. Danny Elfman's score is effective, yet stays in the background for most of the picture. This allows the story to take center stage, with the music adding a backdrop that doesn't detract from what you see.

The film's characters are excellently portrayed, and the actors are some of the best that could be chosen, including Sam Elliot, Nick Nolte, Jennifer Connelly, and Josh Lucas. Only Eric Bana as Bruce Banner seems the most unlikely choice, and it's unfortunately he who seems the most out of place. We're supposed to believe that Banner's character has some kind of rage that's been building up inside him for years, yet all his memories of WHY he should be angry seem to be repressed. It's a little difficult for the audience to believe that Banner is angry about anything when he doesn't even know it himself. That could be the fault of the screenwriters, but the actor can also use a little license to communicate something that may not be written in parentheses.

What puzzles me was the chosen ending. Not being a fan or avid reader of the comic, I don't know how the original Bruce-and-Betty storyline was supposed to go, but the ending to this film wasn't all that satisfying. It has the ""uhoh!!"" factor that can lead to the obvious choice to make a sequel (read: X-Men, Spider-Man, I Know What You Did Last Summer), but it could also explicably stand on its own without a sequel to ruin the legacy. Rightfully, this story should not have a sequel follow it, as it maintains the correct tone and story on its own. No part II is needed here.

The dialogue is very much like what you might read in a comic book, so there is the campy feel in much of what is spoken. Yes, the Hulk is CGI, but if you can look past that (which you really MUST), you'll find that the rest of the visual effects are real enough to give belief that the Hulk is actually tearing up the lab, busting through a house, and spitting the detonating tip of a missle at a helicopter. Most importantly, though, you must remember that this story is a drama that happens to have some action sequences. The action is a means to an end, an effect borne out of a cause, and is not the central point of the story. Many of the images you will see won't be pleasant, and I know a 10-year old who had nightmares as a result of watching this movie. But if you're looking for a well-crafted piece of cinematic storytelling, you can't go wrong with this movie.

One more thing . . . for those naysayers who repeatedly claim that they thought this movie sucked, I challenge you to sit down and watch it with someone who enjoyed it and do the Ebert and Roeper thing -- discuss certain aspects of the movie and why you believe something does or doesn't work. Ang Lee has made a name for himself with several dramatic mood pieces (Sense and Sensibility, The Ice Storm, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), and this is just another genre in which he was lucky enough to stretch his cinematic muscle. So before you say, ""Yeah, I saw The Hulk and I hated it,"" take another look.

Interesting story about repressed emotions and memories,"This was an interesting story about repressed emotions and memories, as told through the story of the Hulk. Giving a psychological treatment of the main character gave the movie some depth and substance that I appreciated.

However, the acting is so-so- Bana is only okay, and Nolte ultimately fails to convince or compel me as the mad scientist. Worse, the story really let me down. Although many people were put off by the ""slow"" beginning, I was actually enjoying the movie until things fell apart about an hour and a half in. The last 10 minutes or so were especially disappointing, as I (and apparently most reviewers here) simply didn't understand what happened. Finally, must every big-budget picture have a end sequence that opens the window for a sequel? At least don't make it so obvious. It's especially sad when you are watching the movie on video, and know that the box office returns have basically eliminated any chance of a sequel being made (I just saw League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and the same thing happens there.)

By the way, the special effects are pretty good in my opinion. They don't sink or make the movie, so I'll leave it at that.

Comic books are deeper and more dramatic than many people give credit. I think Ang Lee and the writers had a very good goal, but their execution ultimately disappoints. X-Men is an example of a comic book movie with some substance as well, but also has the execution to match. (if Hugh Jackman wasn't already playing Wolverine, it would have been very interesting to see him play Bruce Banner!)",,24 November 2003
I want my two hours back.,"I went to this expecting nothing more than a cheap comic book converstion, and a few hours of simplisitic entertainment.

What I got however was comic book style cutting, exceptional special effects but a movie that lacked pace and for the most part and acceptable script.

One of the few movies that I truly contemplated leaving.

If you must - watch it on dvd - that way you too can turn it off.",,27 June 2003
Bad Film,"Come on. It was bad, really bad. I normally don't like it when people just slag off a film for petty reasons, as it shows no form of objectivity, but Hulk was a bad movie. It was slow. Far too slow to grip you into the story, and in some parts, damn right boring. Some of the acting wasn't the best ever seen, and I think Eric Bana was a poor choice for this movie. I've read a lot of people saying the CG Hulk was poor. It wasn't the best CG character, and it did really stand out, but I thought that was kind of the point. Hulk wasn't supposed to be photo realistic, but more of an up to date on screen comic version. The film was laughable in places, especially when that guy (it was that bad, I can't remember the characters) was blown away by the RPG and the screen paused with a white outline around him. After seeing the trailers I had very low expectations of the film, and unfortunately, it didn't even meet any of them. It's a real shame, as it could have been so good. I'm surprised the producers didn't realise sooner, and make some changes. If you haven't seen it, don't. If you have, I feel your pain.",,31 July 2003
Missing Lou...a Snoozer!,"How hard do you think you would have to kick the back of a movie chair to make an 8-year-old kid that wouldn't shut up, fly off the front?

That is what I was thinking about during the first hour of Hulk. The first hour was paced like an episode of Dawson's Creek and once there was some action the CGI was disappointing. The Hulk was barely visible in the dark and he ran a little too fast for my liking. My vision of the Hulk running is more like Ruben Studdard chasing someone with a cheeseburger.

The casting of this movie was way off. After seeing Bana repeatedly stabbed in the stomach in Chopper, it's hard to see him as some nancy boy scientist.

Nolte was a downer. His first disheveled appearance raised the question between my friends and I of who would win a Jack Daniels drinking contest...Nolte, Busey, or Duval. Duval takes that one, he is just too grizzled to lose.

The highlight of the film was Sam Elliot's perfectly groomed mustache. Between takes he must've had his barber trimming and combing it out, it was just too perfect.

The Hulk was a snoozer. Go see Matrix or X2.",,20 June 2003
"Great potential, but doesn't deliver","I expected great things from this movie. From what I had heard, it was amazing. I was sadly mistaken. I felt the plotline, although very good, took way too long to introduce. Once we finally did hit an action scene, the action was mediocre. The scenes that took place in the desert weren't very entertaining, either. One can only watch a big green guy jump off of mountains for so long before one becomes bored...

See it if the Hulk interests you, but otherwise I'd avoid. 5/10",,16 September 2003
"Too long, but good","This movie is refreshing from the usual super hero movies that are going through theaters nowadays. This movie actually has heart and development in it. The characters are well developed, a rarity in recent films, and the movie is made so you are rooting for the hulk against many enemies, not just one clear cut antagonist. The movie was a bit on the long side however. The movie could've easily been cut down by another thirty minutes without losing much of it's plot development and would have made for a more exciting climax. Overall, the movie has something for the comic book fans but is just as much aimed at regular people.",,21 June 2003
Is this a joke?,"Just saw the movie and I cannot believe that such a big deal was made about it. The graphics were definetly top-notch, but the story line was very disappointing. Eric Bana was a poor casting choice, and Nick Nolte seemed as though he was hopped up on something. The movie would have been much better without the unbelievably surreal ending with his father. I would not recommend this movie to anyone to go see, let alone to rent for home viewing when it is released. Ang Lee - nice try, but you did not succeed this time.",,24 June 2003
It Works!,"Most typical viewers expect the film as a straight forward comic book action/adventure film. But they were wrong, Ang Lee did well in making the Hulk different from any other comic book hero film. The Hulk's story is pure drama, The X-Men, Daredevil and Spider-Man are fighting for their beliefs while he is trying to isolate himself from his curse.

Ang Lee's adaptation of the Hulk is geniusly unrealized. I have to admit there are times in which the pacing of the film is quite slow but it still works. If Ang Lee would do a sequel he should devote time on the visual effects of the green giant, I know it's his first time dealing with visual effects just like Bryan Singer when he was still making X-Men I hope that experience could help him in the future.

All the praises for the cast and crew, they did justice to the Hulk. I expect more drama, more action, powerful villains and a poignant music score just like in the TV series.",,5 July 2003
BAD BAD MOVIE!!!!!!,This has got to be the worst comic book film EVER!!!!! It had absolutely no connection with the original comic book story. (aside from a big green guy)...

Final Verdict:B+(87%)",,27 June 2003
brilliant artistry,"""The Hulk"" is such a rich directorial and cinematographic offering that it deserves to be viewed multiple times. Indeed, frames from the film could be enlarged and put on display in an art gallery. Check out the evocation of a girl's childhood memory in saturated colors -- these are not arbitrary choices, folks. Artists are at work.

Symbolism is everywhere. Light and dark, just for starters. How often does Bruce Banner's father appear in the dark? Again, these are not arbitrary choices. Lichens on twisted boughs of wood, The Hulk in twisted boughs of wood. Jellyfish and mushroom clouds. Perhaps soon we'll see a full-fledged college course on the matter.

As for the story, it deserves to be seen in the tradition of Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""Dekalog"" (a sort of ""eleventh commandment"" for the 21st century, one might say). Take another look. The troubled characters, the slow intensity, the recurring visual motifs, it's all in there.

The casting was perfect. Sam Elliott offered a brilliant, nuanced performance of a complex individual. Nick Nolte's portrayal was so natural that in some places it was easy to forget that he was acting. (When his character launches into histrionics, we must remember that we in the audience are surrogates for his on-screen audience.)

In summary, look to ""The Hulk"" for brilliant artistry on many levels.",,30 June 2003
Shrek on steroids,"Having only been exposed to the TV series version of the HULK, I was not aware of what the 'real' Marvel version of the hulk was supposed to be like. So - when the movie FINALLY got started - to see a version of SHREK on steroids was a bit surprising... and leaping large distances???

The start of the movie was disjointed - with an approach to explaining how David Banner experimented on himself and how this genetic change is passed onto his son Bruce, leaving you with a headache and no clearer as to what is going on. When Bruce is finally exposed to the gamma radiation you get the feeling that MAYBE the movie is going to start now...

It still takes a while - with a half hearted plot regarding David Banner trying to get in touch with his son - or trying to destroy him - you are never sure what's going on - especially when David Banner sends his 'Hulked up' dogs after Betty - which all seems like an excuse for the CGI boys to have fun...

After this there is a attempt to harvest the rage within HULK by various scientists which you know will results in HULK getting angry, escaping and having a CGI battle with various tanks and helicoptors and planes - which while admittedly amusing.. just leaves you wanting a bit more out of the film.

Then - the film just gets silly... I wont spoil it for you... as your kids will probably love it.....

Me - I need a film with a bit more plot.

Or a plot would be nice....",,3 July 2003
This movie was worse than the Mets,What a pile of garbage. If I wanted to watch an episode of 24 I would have rented the DVD. Who thought that multiple camera angles on the same thing at the same time was good? It detached the viewer from the film and took away from any sort of decent cinematography.

what a shame,"Here you have all the fine elements of a good film. Ang Lee, Eric Bana, Sam Elliott and Nick Nolte among them. Jennifer Connelly is the only mistake in casting. I guess what lost me was the animated body of the Hulk. I felt the TV series with Lou Feringo as the Hulk was better. Ang Lee makes a wonderful dark film with real actors, except Connelly, and then I feel cheapens it with animation. Maybe it was the comic book look that did it. In KING KONG the ape came across realistic and made the relationship of the leading lady more real. In this it didn't work. First of all Connelly was just awful. That hank of hair constantly hanging in her face was so damn annoying I wanted to reach out and cut the thing off. Didn't she ever hear of bobby pins, berets, or hair spray? Then she lets her hair down and it's even worse. Not the most attractive of leading ladies she was the worst of the cast. Good to see Sam Elliott in whatever he does. Still has that terrific look. Nick Nolte, right out of his BEVERLY HILLS character was his usual self and Eric Bana, whom I don't know had the right intensity in the role. I prefer Ang Lee's BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, where the same dark theme is there but the actors, scenery, story, photography were magnificent.",,7 February 2007

Very long and very boring.,"Movie Ratings: ***** Unmissable **** Excellent *** Good ** OK * Bad

Hulk. (2003)

Stars: Eric Bana, Jennifer Connely, Sam Elliot, Josh Lucas and Nick Nolte.

The Plot:

Based on the popular 70's television series and comic books. Scientist Bruce Banner (Eric Bana), is involved in an accident when 'Gamma Radiation' explodes and lands him in hospital. When Bruce gets out he feels some changes and learns when he gets angry... People wouldnt like him when he is angry as he turns into a massive, well built, strong HULK! Unable to control his transformations he turns to fellow Dr Betty Ross (Jennifer Connely) to help him surpress his rage and help him not to let the Hulk out. But when the secrets out the military led by Betty's Father (Sam Elliot) heads out to experiment on the Hulk, the unjolly green giant goes on the run, creating havoc wherever he goes.

Plot Ends.

Not very good at all. This is far too long and sometimes very boring.

It takes 45 minutes to see Banner transform into the Hulk and when we see the Hulk, He is nothing more than a fake looking CGI (Computer Graphic Interface) charachter. Quite frankly he looks like Shrek.... with steroids.

Just not in the league of 'Spider-Man' or X-Men' at all.

If your a fan of the green giant you will definetly like it but if you are not only see this if you have nothing else better to do.

The Hulk has come to life!,"After reading some of the comments made by so called fans of the Hulk comic books, I was quite surprised that many did not like this movie. The story was great, especially the origin. In fact being a long time comic book fan and Hulk nut, I thought this origin more completely demonstrates why the Hulk is unique in His abilities. If Gamma radiation was the only factor for his powers, then duplicating them should be rather easy. With this origin it is clear that he is the only human alive with these unique genetic traits that allow the radiation and nanobots to be stable enough to cause the metamorphosis.

The story was solid, the casting and acting were top notch and the Hulk was as real as is possible today(which I thought was great). Yes, it would be nice to have more Hulk moments, but not at the cost of a good story; Hulk 2, if there is to be one, will allow more than enough time for a lot of smash.",,9 February 2004

Comic Book Buffs Will Be Disappointed,"Being a huge fan of The Incredible Hulk TV series, comics, and cartoon, I thought that this movie was going to blow me away- with the mastery of digital effects and sound in movies I figured that if all else, at least I would enjoy the effects. Something that I enjoyed about this movie was the way it was filmed. If you've ever seen Creepshow, you'll know what I mean. The movie follows like a comic book with multiple screens acting as drawing panels the way comics are laid out. The effects were well done, but when digital effects are mixed in with live action, the effects lose their professionalism and look cartoonish. Other than that, there was nothing good about this movie and I'll give the run down of why it's bad. First off, the movie is 2 and a half hours long which is WAY too long for a movie of this caliber. Movies over 2 hours are usually so long because they HAVE to be. Hulk could have been made decent in 90 minutes. The story line (as far as I've known, correct me if I'm wrong) is completely different than the original comic book and TV hulk story line. Inconsistencies such as this are unforgivable with movies like this. Comic book buffs are not going to like inconsistencies with stories that they love. The acting by Jennifer Connelly was irritating and boring, and Eric Bana gave an unconvincing shot at being Bruce Banner. Another dumb thing about the movie is that the Hulk was not the only one with superpowers, making his superpower utterly pointless. Nick Nolte looked disgusting in this movie and after the first BORING Hulk metamorphosis, I wanted to leave the theater. If you are planning on watching this movie- don't. Instead rent or buy an episode of two of The Incredible Hulk TV series which I have seen for sale on DVD. You will be more than disappointed with this load of garbage.",,10 August 2003
God Bless Ang Lee,"I had major reservations about this one--the previews make it look ridiculous, but Ang Lee pulls off some amazing stuff in this movie. Lots of great split-screen and reverse angles and framing. Also, the Hulk itself was pretty scary, which totally surprised me seeing as how he is completely CGI. A good movie!",,9 July 2003
Hulk's emotions,"I have known already it would be different when i bought Hulk. Ang Lee is one of my favorite director especially after watching Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. From my point of view it is very hard to understand the average rating of this film. I am shocked right now. The film is unbeliavable, so different from other huge studios films. Ang Lee has changed all statics rules of the big studios that apply such a big movies. No famous actor in leading role, no big explosions, no too much action etc etc. Instead of them there is more humanistic sight and story. I liked it very much. While you are watching may be you can not see what you expect such a big movie but you can feel the Hulk's anger and sadness, in fact that's what i really expect. 9/10",,15 March 2004
Brilliant filmmaking,"This was, simply put, a brilliant film. Ang Lee is a master craftsman, and he pulls out all the tricks in his cinematic bag for this one. The poetic imagery, the transitions, the split screens...just amazing. As for the movie itself, I appreciated the pacing and character development prior to the introduction of the Hulk himself. I agree with some other posters that this film was released at the wrong time, because an intelligent, thoughtful film like this doesn't belong in a crop of Summer fluff like ""Charlie's Angels 2"" or ""Bad Boys 2"" or ""2 Fast 2 Furious"". This is definitely the most intelligent comic book adaptation ever made, but the action sequences also kicked some serious heinie. The CGI was incredible; the Hulk was subtle, expressive, and never looked fake to me. He was just another one of the actors in the film. I have seen this film three times already, and I hope to see it again before it leaves the theaters. I have read many of the critiques of this film, and all I can say is, most of those people clearly have never read the comic, and the others must have the attention spans of 3-year-olds. A great film all around, and the best comic book film since ""Superman: The Movie"". I can't wait for the sequel(s).",,16 July 2003
If giant green cabbages are your thing - watch this!,"Oh dear.

As a child of 7 or 8 years old, I used to sit engrossed on a Saturday afternoon to the Bill Bixby TV version of the Hulk. He got mad, the rage coursed through his body, starting at his eyes, and ending with his biceps tearing through his shirt. He stomped about, destroying things in a way every child wished he could do to his bedroom, then calmed down and turned back into the dazed and confused Dr Banner. So when they announced it was to be re-made on the Big Screen, like all fans of the TV show, and the comics, I was having it in a big way. Even when high - art, psycho - analytic director Ang Lee was placed at the helm, whilst it vexed me, it didn't wane my enthusiasm for the movie. And then the screen-shots appeared in the papers.

A disgusting blob of green mess, which had been so carefully kept under-wraps, and instantly I thought it should have stayed under-wraps. More and more shots of this 'thing' were leaked and every one looked even worse than the previous. I was starting to loathe the thought that such an iconic figure was getting ruined by this CGI abomination. Morbid curiousity took me to see the film, and my horror was complete. The first half hour was tedious and banal, the comic book style screens, whilst refreshingly unique, did not fit with the psychological journey Lee was trying to drag us through. The change from banner to hulk looked impressive the first time, but the minute the thing started to move it was excruciating to watch. Worse still, the scene where the beast skulked around outside Betsy's bedroom window like a predatory voyeur, hiding behind a CGI tree was pathetic. Hulks father / greatest foe / absorbing man sends CGI dogs to fight the CGI Hulk in a CGI forest and the results are a shambles to watch. If you wish to see a film like this, which is infinitely better, watch Roald Dahl's ""The BFG"", which is meant to be animated, as opposed to just looking like it is.

The TV series of 'The Incredible Hulk', whilst dated, has a feel-good nostalgia. This is an insult to the memory of it. Thank goodness And Lee dropped 'The Incredible' from the title, as the only thing 'incredible' about this version of the Hulk was the end credits. Please, please, please do not insult us with a sequel, which I think may be too much to bear.",,15 May 2004
"great movie, just one problem","The Hulk was a great movie. Eric Banna did a great job playing Bruce Banner, Jennifer Connely was perfect for Betty Ross, and Ang Lee was at his best directing it. Everything was great, just a few parts that were as little boring though. The only problem that i have with the film is that the Hulk itself does not look real, i think they could have done a better job on him. Well, in my book, I would give Hulk an A-.",,21 June 2003
Message to Marvel: Have a FAN Direct,"Ang Lee wasn't a real big fan, or perhaps even familiar, with the Hulk before being tapped to direct, and this is what we get. Thanks for ruining one of the best creations in American pop culture. Spider-Man worked because you had someone who grew up with the character directing and respecting the subject matter. What a waste of money and concept. Maybe someone can save this ""franchise"" but if they ever let Ang Lee direct anything without subtitles again they deserve what they get.",,24 June 2003
"Oh, Dear!",,,13 August 2003
Hulk (Not A) Smash!,"Talented director Ang Lee tries to modernize and bring added complexity to this big-budget adaptation of the iconic green-skinned giant, best known from his long-running Marvel comic book and the rather cheesey TV series. However, while Lee's intentions are good he bogs down the character with an overly convoluted, plodding, and revisionist origin.

In Lee's version orphan Bruce Banner is adopted as a child and grows up to become emotionally pent-up scientist Bruce Krensler (Eric Bana). While working with his ex-girlfriend Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) on a process to increase human strength and healing using gamma rays and ""nanomeds"", Bruce is accidentally exposed to a potentially fatal dose of both. Instead of killing him though, they react with a genetic mutation Bruce inherited from his long-lost geneticist father David Banner (Nick Nolte) and psychological trauma caused by repressed childhood memories to transform him into the monstrous Hulk when angry. Bruce is then hunted by Betty's estranged father, General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (Sam Elliot), greedy soldier turned entrepreneur Glen Talbot (Josh Lucas), and his own dad, recently released from a mental institution. Each wants to exploit the Hulk's powers for their own ends.

As originally created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the Hulk was always a tragic monster inspired by ""Frankenstein"", ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", and ""King Kong"" rather than a conventional super-hero. Fittingly, Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" resembles a sci-fi creature feature more than it does ""Spider-Man"". However, the story by James Schamus makes the rather straightforward character much more complicated than he needs to be and drags on for about a half-hour too long. Lee doesn't help things by overindulging in distracting cinematic trickery like split-screens, zooms, and wipes and the hoary old narrative devices of dream sequences and flashbacks (and sometimes dream sequences within flashbacks!).

As many people have already commented, the CGI Hulk created by ILM is not entirely convincing. As for myself, I was able to suspend my disbelief while the leaping, super-strong Hulk was battling the U.S. military or a pack of mutated dogs. However, the filmmakers make the mistake of portraying the Hulk as too powerful. Like Superman without Kryptonite, an invincible hero quickly becomes boring.

I thought the picture was well cast up until Nolte goes off the deep end and turns into a knock-off of the old comic book villain the Absorbing Man. Ironically, while Lee and Schamus strive to give the Hulk more depth, they end up stripping him of his personality. In the comic book, the Hulk had the mind of a five-year old, the grammar of a caveman (sample dialogue: ""Hulk smash!""), and sympathy towards children, animals, and other helpless innocents. In the movie, the Hulk only speaks in a dream sequence, outwits the army, and is just a big angry guy who trashes everything until the presence of Betty calms him down. And while I'm glad that ""Hulk"" avoids the campiness of some comic book-to-movie adaptations, it is so deadly serious it lacks all sense of humour or fun. Instead the laughs are unintentional, like when a logical explanation is provided for the ever-changing size of the Hulk, but not the ever-changing size of his shorts.

All in all, ""Hulk"" is better than most comic book movies, but it is too flawed to be a fully satisfying moviegoing experience.

It's not easy being green...,,,22 June 2003
Wowzers!,"K, I went into this movie being a skeptic cause I did see the trailers and let me tell you, they did the movie no justice. The story is incredible and the Hulk looks amazing! The only thing I can complain about is that the movie did seem to drag on at times, but that's hardly worth mentioning. In my opinion, Hulk kicks Spidey's ass. Go see it.",,19 June 2003
Misunderstood,"This is a very misunderstood film. Before it came out people were expecting a typical comic book movie in the same groove as the likes of Spider-Man and X-Men. The distributors, in their wisdom, merchandised the hell out of it even before it was released, bringing up peoples expectations for such a movie. What we got leaned more towards an arthouse feel that only someone such as Ang Lee could provide us with.

This film focuses on the psychological effects of Banner's condition, occasionally providing some great visual metaphors for what he is coping with. The visual style itself if innovative, taking a lot of influence from the way comic books are structured. The characters are so well defined and built up that this film has the kind of depth that is so hard to come by in mainstream cinema. And, no matter what you thought of the film, the special effects were top notch. Some people should think more objectively when ""criticising"" a film, rather than thinking ""Oh I didn't like that film, therefore everything about it (including the CGI) was total rubbish"".

The film is not without its flaws though - it felt a bit too long and I had an issue with the pacing, in that there were times when some serious action was going down (yes I like action too) that were punctuated by moments of quietness and calm. Obviously this provides a good dynamic contrast, but even I have to admit that it was a bit perverse to shake us up and down like that.

All in all, I don't think it is as bad as people say it is. This is a film to pay attention to, not necessarily something to rent out on a Saturday night to bring to a party for people to watch. It's a damn sight better than Daredevil in my opinion anyway.",,4 March 2004
Did the makers learn nothing from the first X-Men movie....,"OK, the acting is good, the effects are excellent, BUT!!! if you can't wait for the follow-up (IF there is one), don't bother going into the theater until this movie is at least 40 minutes into the story, it's all build-up, and NOT good build-up ............ I'd give the first 40 minutes 2/10 after that a good 8/10. .... roll on ""Hulk II""",,21 July 2003
Worst movie ever,"I'm really sorry to say this, but the movie was so bad we actually left the theatre. The movie was too slow, and it took more then an hour to introduce the Hulk. The Hulk himself was computer generated and boy, it showed. The unnatural movements destroyed the movie. The computer generated dogs were too much for us and that's when we left the building. We give it 1 out of 10. Couldn't be any worse...",,11 July 2003
The very best of the genre,"HULK is the finest of the comic genre I have yet seen. I was particularly looking forward to this film because I had followed the comic through most of the 1990's, especially during the writing tenure of Peter David. When I had heard Ang Lee was going to tackle this film, I was pleased and stunned. I think the results are at least meeting my expectations.

I must commend a fine cast on their performances. I also must speak in defense of the CGI. I liked the way they brought the Hulk to the screen. If he looked like Shrek, peachy. It could have been worse.

Specifically, I liked the underlying drives of the film. I liked the subtle threat posed by the military and Atheon. Their desire to control the Hulk, naturally, leads to a confrontation with a force of nature. I liked that Bruce Banner was paradoxically whole and yet not whole for the first time in his life because of this extraordinary creature he becomes. His emotions and personality experience a sweet primordial freedom, but he is at the same time split down the middle. This balances the sense of tragedy, and somewhat mutes the horror aspect of the story. However, I think the film sought to reconcile these two elements, that of horror and the superheroic. For me, it did so effectively. On the one hand, Eric Bana as Banner is overwhelmed by the power of this mutation he has experienced. On the other, the Hulk, this primal force, both in the sense of human drives and raw physical power, facing off against all those who would manipulate, control, or destroy him. The joy of the film comes in the vicarious identification with that sort of wish fulfillment. The tragedy is the grim price they extract on Bruce and Betty.

A wonderful film.",,22 June 2003
fact not fiction,"Overall the Hulk was mediocre film. The story lacks and the filming is poorly done. I love that Ang Lee tried to bring the comic feel to the Hulk, but he did not manage to keep me into the story which had to much detail. I kept feeling that i was watching the spiderman on the electric company. You know the one. The CG was done well. If you read any of the comics you will have appreciation for this film. The ability to jump, run and the fact that he is a giant are all done well. I would see it again at a matinee. I give it a 2 3/4 on a 0 to 5 scale 5 being great. on a 0 to 10 I give a 6 better then half.. Enjoy.",,29 June 2003
"Can see why they missed out the word ""Incredible.""","There's nothing incredible about this film. In fact, to call it ""The Mediocre Hulk"" would have been inappropriately kind.

This film is a dirge from start to finish with, as so many people have said, a long, drawn-out introduction taking up the first half of the film before anything happens at all. This intro seems to serve no purpose but to show how vicious the main characters are with unpleasant vivisection scenes and the characters making jokes about test subjects' deaths. The intro could have been summed up in five minutes to allow for two hours of the big green giant bouncing around.

That said, in a way it's good that it didn't because two hours of such laughably plastic looking CGI would have been too much for me to take. He moved so fast and jerkily it seemed more like watching Bugs Life speeded up, with a touch of Benny Hill running around chasing big breasted women to Yakety Sax. He didn't have the menace the original Hulk had in the TV series and even his actions as the Hulk seemed to have no point to them at all.

I failed to see the point of the ending, if there was one. Its only purpose seemed to be to give me an excuse to get out and go home and ponder the pile of worthless trash I'd just spent my money and time on. Daredevil, XMen and X2 were all better than this by miles.

The people who've given positive reviews of this film need psychiatric help, there's nothing to give this any score at all. In cases where people have given 7/10, I'm sure they've missed a 0 and actually meant 7/100.

Even that's generous. 0%. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS, PLEASE! It's basically a kids' film you wouldn't let your kids see.

Freak",,19 July 2003
Unlike any other comic-book film,"I watched this on an airplane ride. Loved it. Didn't have high expectations because of the mixed reviews. Then realized that reviews are always to be taken with a grain of salt.

Unlike other comic book films that almost always appear cartoon-ish, this film was far more introspective. Relative to the length of the film, the minimal amount of screen time spent on showcasing the actual Hulk was actually quite refreshing. I found the emphasis on why the Hulk is who he is, and how he got there, to be a successful attempt by Lee to humanize him.

And Bana played the tormented Banner awfully well. I hope to see more of him in the future.

I give this film 7 out of 10.",,15 February 2004
Really No Worse Than Any Other Marvel,"Theres a lot of things wrong with The Hulk so it's hard to say everything wrong with it. For starters, the movie is bogged down in a lot unneeded 'drama' which might be there to enrich it but just does the opposite. When you actually have sequences with the big green guy, it's only so entertaining for so long, especially with the visual effects which are still in a primitive age of cgi technology. And the whole time the movie is told using some unusual and annoying editing style which probably was intended to resemble a comic book style but it makes an already bad movie that much harder to watch.

The cast is alright though their roles are not and mostly why you can watch this movie for any intended period of time although the recommended one for The Hulk is zero minutes.",,4 July 2022
Comic book reproduction,"Hulk is not an action packed EPIC movie, which its preamble insinuates. Although there are several well animated fight/action sequences the main theme seems to be 'Bruces' constant fight with his inner feelings, fueled by a traumatic childhood and unanswered questions about the death of his mother and father. This climax's with the realisation of his past and the coming to terms of his present state.

The style of the direction/production attempts to convey a 'comic book' theme, using multiple frames within a single shot, but this sometimes becomes a little too overpowering. This leaves you wanting to see the whole picture, not just a close up or several sequences cut together. Overall 'Hulk' requires a little perseverance. Marvel comic book readers and action movie watchers could be disappointed.

Worth a watch. 7/10.",,8 July 2003
Don't make me bored... You wouldn't like me when I'm bored.,"zzzzzzzz... This movie is so boring. It's nothing like Spiderman or X-Men in terms of plot or action. I'm sure it'll make money off of the hype, but it certainly doesn't deserve it. Luckily, we'll probably never heard from Eric Bana again. For a character as complex as the Hulk is in this film, he's just too stiff for the role. Just say no to a sequel! If you like comic book movies, skip this one and wait for the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.",,20 June 2003
SMASHY SMASHY JUST FOR FUN!,"An awesome achievement in master story telling (thanks to Ang Lee) and state of the art SFX, the Hulk is easily the most satisfying movie this summer. The pacing is far better than Matrix Reloaded's jumbled mess of combing scenes that don't belong in the same movie, and even the still great X2 that has a habit of starting then stalling with great action set pieces, then long stretches of character exposition, and making the mistake of having the best action scene at the very start of the movie, with not much afterwards to live up to it. I don't understand it when people say the Hulk, compared to X2 (which admittedly had more humour) takes itself too seriously, and Lee is not ashamed to blow up the screen and show us some truly amazing action/FX shots, whereas Brian Singer seems as though he wants to focus more on the themes and issues of being a mutant, rather than the capabilities these mutants have of kicking some serious butt. And also the rather zealous approach of wanting to make it into a huge series, when we know that round 4 or 5, no ones gonna care (apart from the comic book geeks).

Forget Daredevils' tacky direction, as I forgot I saw the damn thing, and I cant actually remember seeing any more big budget fare so far this year, and lets focus on the hulk. Slowly and steadily building up the tension and stretching the exposition, whilst simultaneously revelling in the master editing techniques (include swipes, split screens, CGI zoom ins and so on, recalling the style of a comic book, truly genius) the film at this point, unlike many others in the genre, hardly has a weak scene. Ok, so at the very start there's a clichéd over use of music score (which thankfully goes away pretty soon) and at first the child hood scenes seem ludicrous, but are used to better use in flashback later on in the film and to further develop the motivations, putting them into better context. On the whole I actually enjoyed this part of the film. None of the dialogue felt that hammy, none of the acting wooden or forced, no over the top, why use-actors-to-express-characters-emotions-when-you-can-get-a-composer-to-do- it type score. Now the hard parts out the way, the part that relies on proper character and film mechanics, it worked (although never quite bang on, but then it never would be). But was convincing enough, and even had a couple of truly beautiful, artistically creative sequences that recall loss and tragedy. My favourite scene, when Nolte gives his speech about a tragic moment that, in no way can ever be changed or compensated and becoming nothing but a memory, is truly heartbreaking, with barely a single bit of CGI in sight.

Then when the hulk kicks in and gets mean, damnit, it'll kick you. Hard. The climax is truly spectacular, showing you some heart stopping, never before seen stuff as the hulk leaps around and goes ape s***. People who say these SFX are rubbish, would probably say that you're holding up 5 fingers, when in actual fact you're holding up your index one. In reverse. At them. What the hell are these guys on? Yeah, I agree, Citizen Kane is a TERRIBLE film! Robert De Niros' best performance was adventures of Rocky and Bull Winkle, and NOT Raging Bull or The Deer Hunter. Al Pacino's best performance was Dick Tracy, and NOT Serpico or Godfather Part 2. STUPID MONGER! Now go book an appointment at the opticians, then see the film again when your vision has improved.

The use of CGI is so seamless, the expression on the hulks face and his movement with little to no blurring effect (always a fault of CGI) is pitch perfect, and Ang Lee has an ability not unlike Peter Jackson to shoot these scenes in a matter of fact, no big deal, seamless kinda way, which enhances it (note the Hulk rampaging about on the TV monitors, we only seem him in close up if we have to). Technically he's better than Gollum, although Gollum wins hands down in the performance stakes, whereas Hulk is more of an abominable creation that goes mad and smashy smashy just for fun, and does this with true grace and beauty, going YEAH YEAH! and loving it. Ace.

With 45 minutes of near flawless exposition, with more than adequate performances from all concerned (especially Nick Nolte and Eric Bana) and a not disappointing in the slightest, damn near ground breaking use of SFX climax, this, my friends, is how you make a genuinely a** kicking, overall more than satisfying big budget movie, that may hold up to numerous repeated viewings. Oh and it's the best, and most innovative, comic book adaptation since Superman.",,13 July 2003
The worst movie of this year.,"Even though I'm such a huge fan of Ang Lee, as my reckoning The Hulk is the worst movie of this year. If I were him, I would like to get rid of this film of my works. While I was watching this film, I checked my watch a hundred and thousand times. Too long to see, and too boring to see......-.-",,8 July 2003
I've seen worst...,"Yes I have, well I'm gonna go for a unconventional and straight to the point review. Pros: CGI was believable, you can see the human pain and emotions going through the Hulk's mind. The pace of the editing, although sometimes a bit annoying, was pretty cool it played out like a live comic book.

Cons (oh boy here we go, Fun!): Hmmm... ""Puny human"", the first 18 minutes of the ""film"" was completely useless, tell me why say everything we need to know and spoon feed the audience and then go back to it but this time the characters figuring it out? A much more effective way would have been for the audience to discover the backstory along with the characters, this could have possibly help the audience connect or care more for the characters. Love story? what love story? Besides the cool concept of Bruce Banner becoming a complete wreck and monster without the love of the woman he loves, there is no chemistry between the two romanticly linked characters (Banner and Betty Ross). The last battle scene between father and son although in concept is not bad, the reality is that is not necessary and it was completely laughable in the ""film"" So there you go I hope this review was comprehensible.",,11 July 2003
Another Marvel-ous hit,"The Hulk movie in my opinion was perfectly done, the ending may seem a bit out of place but it still blew me away. The whole plot was well executed, each event was broken down nicely leading up to first Hulk transformation. The characters were well developed and the movie gives you a good history background of each character that makes the movie run along smoothly. Ang Lee did excellent job of building up anticipation to the Hulk's first appearance. The first transformation of the Hulk wasn't too long or too fast it was just perfect. This movie is just beautiful to watch, seeing everything unfold step by step was really sweet. The movie also has a comics book presentation to it, using panels to show scenes in different angles. As for the Hulk and how is looks. Let me just that the Hulk is probably best character ever to grace the big screen. Using a CGI Hulk was best thing Ang Lee did cause it captures the Hulk's true comic book experience. Using a human actor like huge body builder would've looked really cheesy and it would've destroyed the movie. 90% of Hulk scene's looked real as hell. The facial expressions,the movements,and the body language of the Hulk was stunning. This is best comic book movie ever made. I can't compare it to X-Men 2 cause that's a sequel, characters have already been introduced and developed. But when compared to other first time movies like Spider Man,Daredevil,and X-Men. The Hulk is the best one out of all of them. I hope there's a sequel to this movie and we all get to see the Hulk in a more destructive manner in a city environment battling a cool villian.",,23 June 2003
Overrated bag of crap,"Upon seeing this movie the first time, I noticed that it was not only an unorganized pile of BS, but also that much time was wasted on trying to make this one-dimensional flick into a fully fledged classic(which it did not achieve mind you). I also took note of the fact that the trendy comic book style transitions not only didnt fit in in dramatic scenes, but also detracted from the overall quality of this mediocre ""action"" film.

Upon seeing it a second time, I noticed that not only did this film amount to nothing more than around five poorly staged action ""setpieces"" and approximately 6,000,000,000 overacted ""dramatic"" scenes(i.e. such as the father/son scene at the end where Bana and Nolte are chit-chatting in the for some odd reason electrically charged room and both then proceed to scream for no reason whatsoever at one another. For no reason other than to make the scene dramatic that is. Which it was not). The movie, to add to its many faults, was also not understandable at all. Such indescribable scenes include: The scene where Nolte is bombarded with gamma rays and then, for a completely unexplained reason, proceeds to turn into everything that he touches; Another scene that made the movie blah, blah, blah, blah, and, well, blah.

Let me just give it to you plain out, when this ball of crap rolls into stores disguised as a DVD, don't even consider watching it, because it will make you even more stupid than you were for renting or buying it in the first place.",,4 October 2003

"Um, relax people!","FOr those who seem to have it in for the Hulk movie, based on your viewing the TV show and find the origins, etc, different, and the Hulk's size different, remember this:

The TV show caught flack when IT came out. It ALSO changed the Hulk's origins. The original Comic Hulk was far closer in size/apearance than Lou, in all his greatness, or any other bodybuilder could ever DREAM of achieving.

Where would the FUN be if we kept retelling the SAME origin story EVERY generation?

On the downside, the only thing I DIDN'T like it the final battle scene. Too hard to follow when one of the combatants doesn't have a physical body anymore. They caught that in the first BLADE movie, and reshot the fight with Frost, because fighting a CGI blob just isn't engaging.

Not only was this movie boring, not only was this movie extrememly overrated, but this film was not true to the comic book version of the Hulk.

Since when is Bruce Banner cursed by his father David Banner (for the record they took the David Banner name from the 70s TV series Hulk) and then gets exposed to gamma rays the way he did....in the Comic Book version Bruce Banner is exposed to Gamma rays while trying to save a young man, Rick Jones, who wondered into a nuclear bomb testing site and Banner, the hero that he is, goes and saves him, in the process the bomb goes off and that's how he's exposed to the Gamma Rays...and in this pathetic waste of a film...well i don't advise on seeing this film but if you really want to know, by all means see it.....i give it 2 stars only cause of the special effects, nothing more...and one last thing...The comic book version Banner tries to find a cure to STOP him from becoming the hulk not LIKE becoming the Hulk",,1 July 2003
Yeah...! Satisfactory!,,,30 July 2003
A modern day Greek Tragedy,"First of all let me congratulate Ang Lee on a job well done. The Hulk, like any other comic book movie, is for the fans of the character above anything else. Having said that, I believe that some who may have never even heard of the character may like the movie because of the way Ang Lee has handled the subject matter. Ang Lee is to The HULK as Sam Raimi was to Spider-Man.

When I first heard the movie was coming out I was really excited but then I saw the Super Bowl trailer..and like many, was skeptical. More than anything else I was interested in the CGI aspect of the film. I'll admit that there are a few places where the CGI could have used a little work but what LITTLE CGI couldn't accomplish the story and the direction more than made up for it, so I wasn't dissapointed.

The cast is okay, especially Nick Nolte as a deranged scientist brought life to his character. The turbulent relation ship between the father and son is the main plot of the film, not the fact that Dr. Bruce Banner becomes the HULK.

The CGI wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. In fact some of the facial expression on the CGI HULK were so real that I (and many of my friends) could identify with the character...and he wasn't even real!!! The part when the HULK stands in front of Bruce's house on the military base..the expression on his face ...hats off to ILM!!!!

The HULK is not without it's flaws.. the movie is too long and a lot of time is taken up in setting the background and introducing the characters. Like many people, I feel that the HULK at times didn't seem real enough. There were many points in the movie where his motions were jerky.

Overall, this is an enjoyable film..but not a breakthrough film. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel(s) to this film and hopefully ILM will have learnt from its mistakes.",,24 June 2003
"Dont waste your time, unless you want to sit over 2 1/2 hours for about 20 minutes of a good scene.","This movie was almost a complete waste. And i could not believe how long it was. I was squirming all over my seat waiting for this garbage to end, and it just kept going!!! Its only saving grace was the extremely short period when Hulk was battling the army in the desert, but that was not nearly enough to save the movie. it went nowhere. The acting was completely horrible, and everybody was doing some extreme overacting. Ang Lee better stick to making marshall arts movies and stay away from the comic books. They did leave room for a sequal, but lets hope they learned there lesson with this one. overall 2/10.",,9 July 2003
Additional Comments (yes i'm back),"Yes, I know what your thinking, why am I writing about this movie again if I said it's so pathetic. well the answer is simple, cause this movie is just TOO DAMN PATHETIC...as i was writing the first I was thinking just what exactly did Ang Lee want to do with this film and then i figured it out...he combined a little (and i mean a little) bit of the comic book, 70's TV series and His own vision for this film. But that is where my biggest problem of this film comes in, Lee wanted to incorporate his own vision of the film...A BIG NO NO if your doing a film that already has a backstory to it especially a Comic book film. For all the people and Critics that ""loved"" this film doesn't know diddly s*** about The Incredible Hulk and Comic books for that matter.

And as far as acting goes, did they even give Eric Bana (Bruce Banner) an audition for this film..i mean it looks so fake the way he would get angry that i thought at times he was constipated. In my honest opinion i think the producers just rushed to get this film out to profit on other Mavel Movies (Spider Man, X Men..not Daredevil which is equally bad) and Lord help marvel if they continue like this...They should've gotten Stan Lee not Ang Lee to direct this film.",,1 July 2003

FANTASTIC!,"I too was lucky enough to go to a private screening, and I'd have to say it's one of the best out there. I'm not much of a comic book person, never have been, never will be, but I loved this movie. I admit there are people out there that won't like this, either because ""it doesn't stick directly to the comic"" or maybe just because of the way ""HULK"" is filmed. Well, lighten up people, it's a movie! The special effects are amazing, the story-line's great, and this movie's well worth the cost of a ticket.

need to be open minded,"if you go to this movie expecting something that YOU want to see, you are probably taking the wrong approach.....there are alot of complaints about bad cgi, bad acting, unrealistic sceens and whatever else.....people tend to forget that this movie is based from a comic book, not real life....don't go in challenging what you are going to see by comparing it to what you know about the hulk....be open minded to what you might see....you'll then enjoy it .....considering what Lee was up against; making the hulk cgi, i think it was well done, especially in the daylight (where most cgi characters fail to look good with real film taping) for me this movie was alot of fun to watch...it does have a serious feel to it, but so did the tv show, the last 20 minutes took a big jump from the rest of the film where it might leave you thinking ?? while watching it...but overall if you are a hulk fan like i was when i was a kid.....it will be a treat to see him throwing a tank about 3 miles and using a cannon as a baseball bat...",,24 June 2003
hulk - for grown ups.,"i was quite excited by the prospect of this one. i thought if anyone could make it more than just a silly action piece, it would be ang lee that could do it. and boy does he try to make it moving, and dramatic. but my god does he try too hard. it would have been lovely if he balanced it out evenly. action, drama, action, drama, but ang persists on trying to get the audience to emote to the main characters sad predicament. but we dont need that. a little would be nice, but when for the seventh time, we see bruce and betty talking about his anger, and his father and the mysteries surrounding his childhood, the interest gets lost, and it starts to become a little bit dull. then the action breaks out. a little over an hour into the film, and it's actually quite childish considering ang's adult themes. and the hulk is just another big lump of computer. at times, he looks spectacular, others, like shrek. it's too much to balance adult drama and kids action, it just messes up it's intentions. i dont see how any kids would sit through half of this film and enjoy it. okay, the action in the last half hour, when the military get involved is the highlight. scene after scene of volume and madness and chases works wonders after the drag of the first hour. it's engaging. it's what the hulk should have been all along. it's a shame ang got just that little bit over eager, a little bit too ambitious in his scope for this comic book tale.",,27 July 2003
"Below expectations, above average...","Comic book movies! One of the most popular, money making blockbusters right now. Spiderman and Xmen stuck to a simple formula and succeeded, I believe ""Hulk"" failed because it tried to do somthing different, not what everyone expected from a superhero movie. Its worth seeing, but I wouldnt buy it.",,10 November 2003

"Hulk, no bulk sulk","First of all, if you are going to write a review, at least try and make it readable. Furthermore, better grammar and syntax would make your reviews stand up a lot better under scrutiny. You can't pan a film that's taken a whole team of people some considerable time and effort to produce and not take a few moments to put forward a cogent critique.

Now that that is off the chest...to the film itself.

Forget Superman (artistically weak), The Batmans(unbelievably dull) and Spiderman (surprisingly rough), a new tour de force has arrived, ""HULK"". Okay, some have argued the CGI is ordinary, it isn't. Some have suggested that it's boring, no chance. Some have even commented on ""HULK"" being too long, get into it. ""HULK"" is none of these things.

It is in fact slick, thoughtful, exhilerating and eye-candy heaven.

During filming, some of the actors were frustrated by Ang Lee's obsession with the coverage of what appeared to be fairly straight forward dialogue scenes. But in the final product the extra effort in this regard is evident. Lee (the director not the creator) has used this to good effect and ""crosses the line"" a couple of times, paying homage to the comic book itself. He also does this using the split screen technique, sometimes a hard edge, sometimes soft.

For Australian viewers, there are some nods and winks to look out for.

When talbot is asked to leave the room, he replies with a laconic ""no worries"". There is a blue tongue lizard and a eucalypt, the latter also a metaphor for the green HULK and his affinity with all things of nature. This is also the case at the end of the film when Bruce Banner hides deep in a south american jungle.

Go see this, it'll knock your socks off.",,26 June 2003
Hardly a must-see movie.,"Personally, I quite liked the cinematography and movement of the camera and I have always been quite forgiving of CGI effects ever since I mistakenly accused a film of poor CGI only to learn the scene in question actually used a model. Maybe that's what a giant hulk-like creature looks like! I mean buildings look fake when you're in an aeroplane - sometimes the world just looks fake! Accept it.

Anyway. Apart from cinematography I did not enjoy my Hulk experience. Their is a weak plot with almost no story-line and the acting is nothing spectacular. Something I could have waited to see on cable.",,27 July 2003
Close but no cigar,"As much as I tried to like this film (the first 40 minutes were very good), the longer it went the more I got tired with it. The action sequences are few and far between, and not that impressive. I was more interested in the story behind Banner. In all, not as good as X Men 2, but a definite improvement on Daredevil.

Shame, cos this was the film I wanted to see all year.",,6 July 2003
"was this based on the marvel comic, or something else entirely?","i just saw the hulk tonight. i've been reading a lot of the comments posted here, mostly because i'm completely undecided on whether or not i liked (i don't think loved is an option) or hated the movie. a lot of good points have been brought up on the boards. my (oh so respected) opinions:

--the cgi was ok. gollum was a lot better. the trailers made it look worse than it was. it wasnt necessarily realistic in any sense, did look ok if you are expecting a comic book character feel. i wished they could have developed a very realistic hulk. i thought spiderman had about as much depth in the cgi instances. looks almost like a cartoon...too smooth. not what in was wanting, but not jarjar binks bad.

--i thought ang lee's odd scene set ups were actually nicely done, and one of the better parts of the movie.

--anyways, the main reason i posted was to do with the plot. i'm not going to comment on whether or not it was good; i'm still undecided. my criticism (and maybe in other reviews i'll find someone going into more detail about

this) is that it strayed so much from the comic origins. i'm approaching this as a complete hulkophile stance, so its nerdy observations only, and i'd like to read other hulk obsessed comic collectors. but would it have been so hard to at least somewhat followed the original story of how banner became the hulk. betty was never a scientist. banner never really enjoyed being the hulk (maybe debatable if looked at psychologically and delving into his subconcious desires, but he definitely never said he ""liked becoming the hulk and losing control (that i know of)). the guy he saved was rick jones, not ""hooper"" or whatever this unimportant character's name in the movie is. banner was not working on a cure, but employed by the govt who was using his experiments for a bomb that exploded while he was saving jones from being a rebellious teenager. when banner was working on these experiments, he knew his name was banner, and didnt work under an alias. but beyond all this, the entire plot about his father makes no sense to me, and is my biggest hangup on the movie. i'm a little rusty on my facts (and this is where i'd like some comments from other experts on the details of the real hulk story (mostly because my collection is in storage in portland oregon and i cant access it to check myself). i thought banner's father (whose name was brian, not david (these are the little things that drive me nuts; why did they have to rename him?)) was dead, and yes that lead bruce to question his childhood life. but i'm sure his father never actually confronted him (am i wrong fellow nerds?). his father was an abusive (physically and mentally) man who never controlled his anger, so bruce grew up wanting to be the opposite of him. the whole flashback of his father killing his mother, the dna experiments he did, working w/ the govt, being jailed by thunderbolt ross...did any of that happen? i know a lot of the psychological origins of banner's inner rage center on his father's role in his life, but to base the whole movie on his father returning and becoming the absorbing man just isnt clicking with me.

my main point is, when you have a story as intriguing (and with many deep issue possibilities) as the hulk's, why change it so much? what was so wrong about the way the hulk was created as stan lee wrote it, and how the hulk was developed and explored and revealed further on down the line (especially by peter davud in the issues after #300)? those were well written stories. i understand hollywood and movies usually modify plots for the big screen, but this almost only seemed loosely based on the actual comic. it seemed the only real elements left from the actual story of the incerdible hulk are that there's a guy named banner who is doused in gamma and becomes big and green, and he is chased by the army and dates betty ross. other than that, i feel like they just rewrote the fill-ins and created an entirely different storyline. did any of the writers ever really read the comic?",,1 July 2003
People hate it because it's not stupid,"You know, I expected to not like The Hulk. I saw it against my better judgment. Boy was I surprised! Now I know what all those people are complaining about: you see, this movie is not stupid. It's not designed for idiots who want only to see some green guy trashing stuff.

Most of the complaints you see are like ""oh, it's not linear enough"" and ""oh, the setup takes too long."" You see, what these ""linear"" (i.e. stupid) people have missed is that Lee is making art. He got a huge budget and that sets up the expectations for a huge budget movie, and by those standards, The Hulk is too complicated and not manipulative enough. Dumb people get confused easily and find it terribly distressing, so bashing on this movie makes them feel better. Well, let the fools have their tartar sauce.

Of course this movie has some problems to pick on. What I'm talking about is the overall presentation, which I thought was wonderful. As somebody who liked Crouching Tiger and Eat Drink Man Woman, I think this movie is better. Well, definitely better than Crouching Tiger. It's definitely more ambitious, so people who prefer a traditional genre piece like Spiderman will be disappointed.",,23 June 2003
Yawn.,"I just knew this was one of those movies that had to be seen in the theater on the big screen. Boy, am I glad I went to the matinee and only paid $4.75. After sitting through 45 minutes of angst-ridden chatter, we finally got to see an action sequence. Sadly, the high point up to then was seeing Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee in a cameo! I never dreamed that Ang Lee could take a comic hero and make a movie that in parts was as boring as ""The Ice Storm"". Looks like Mr. Lee may be a one-trick pony.

The Hulk character was pretty well-done overall, although, he was much taller than he is in the comic books. The main problem I had with the CGI was the fact that they appeared to compensate for any deficiencies in the animation by using dark sets or putting the Hulk in motion so the audience couldn't see as much detail.

Nick Nolte's character was just unnecessary. They could have shown that whole story with a couple of short flashbacks and then gotten on to the action. It was interesting how the young David Banner looked like a Richard Corben drawing, though. And the scene of his mother reaching for the sky when the gamma burst went off was just melodramatic and stupid looking.

Hey, Avi Arad, next time get an action director to do your comic movies and let Ang Lee stick to what he likes best: dialogue-driven yawners more suited to the pseudo-intelligencia ""film"" snobs.",,30 June 2003
You wouldn't like him when he's angry,"Rating: *** (out of *****)

How hard is it to make a comic book film that will please absolutely everyone? Some, like Superman and Men in Black, have succeeded to a certain degree, but most of the recent efforts have mainly been a hit with their designated audience. Spider-Man won over the teens, the X-Men films were a fan's heaven, and Batman had the atmosphere. Now, can we combine all these elements with a strong back story? Highly regarded director Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) has attempted to do just that with Hulk. The bad news is, he hasn't totally succeeded. It's not that he hasn't made a good go of it - in my opinion, this may be the most innovative comic book adaptation yet - but chunks of the film are strangely dissatisfying.

The film opens back in 1966, where scientist David Banner (Nick Nolte) carried out an experiment on himself. This meant that when his genes were passed through to his son, Bruce, Bruce was affected too. 35 years later, Bruce (Eric Bana), now a scientist, is exposed to gamma radiation in a laboratory accident. But he escapes unharmed, actually feeling even better than he did before the accident. Still, this has another effect on him altogether; needless to say, you wouldn't like him when he's angry.

Lee lets things unfold interestingly. His stylish techniques behind the camera include a comic style split screen that shows us how every character in a scene is reacting at once (and reminding us that this is, after all, a comic book film). The back story, too, couldn't possibly have been explained better. And while there's no clear villain of the piece, that's not a bad thing, for this isn't supposed to be like most of today's superhero films. There are still certain dislikeable characters, however. For example, one character tries making Bruce angry for the purpose of milking money from the whole situation. Actually, the `villain' role constantly switches. General Ross (Sam Elliott) may initially seem like a bad man of sorts, but once we realise his motives we see that this isn't the case. Banner Sr. has a bad side as well - an extraordinary bad side at that.

But only in the midsection does Lee manage the correct balance between character interaction and thrills. Towards the 40 minute mark, the narrative very nearly becomes tiresome, and the final action scene drags to the point where you wish they'd ended the film a bit earlier. Plus, the CGI in the film isn't always convincing. Sometimes it is even laughably bad (for example, watch when David experiments on himself as an old man). And we don't empathise with the Hulk like we did with another famous CGI creature, the Lord of the Rings' Gollum. Maybe we do at the start, but during the final scenes we spend too much time with the beast and not enough with his alter-ego, making us feel more like we're watching a computer game, not a film. Humour is lacking as well (although that wouldn't be a problem if the story wasn't so uneven).

But the film has its saving graces during these periods. One is Jennifer Connelly, who plays Bruce's work colleague and ex-girlfriend, Betty Ross (yes, she's the general's daughter). She's not even made to go to her full potential, yet you can tell how she won an Oscar. She shows a good mix of strength, sweetness and occasional vulnerability, making the CGI Hulk more believable in the process. Josh Lucas is also impressive as a one-dimensional sleazy co-worker. Unfortunately, while it's mostly fun to watch Nick Nolte going over-the-top (and he's enjoying himself, no question), he outstays his welcome near the end. Worst of all, Eric Bana is hardly ever above adequate, never really embodying his character. This is a crucial blow to the film, leaving me to conclude that while Hulk is definitely a good experience on the whole, it could have been better. Still, fans should be pleased.",,4 August 2003
Terrible.,"My summary pretty much sums up The Hulk as a whole. The cheap effects weren't very special. It seemed Marvel comics thought with all the money they are raking up with movies such as Spider-man, X-Men, and Daredevil that they might as well make The Hulk and lets the dollars fly in. Too bad that isn't the case with this movie, and maybe next time Marvel or any other company decides to try and rake in more cash from other franchises, they will try and make their movie better.

"HULK, not as good as SPIDERMAN, drowns in CGI and goes on forever","Hulk (2003) Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Sam Elliott, Josh Lucas, Nick Nolte, D: Ang Lee. While working on a regeneration experiment conducted by the military, a scientist uses himself as a guinea pig to modify his own DNA, and the mutation gets passed on to his son. Now a grown man, the repressed geneticist (like his father) gets himself into a freak lab accident that triggers the dormant DNA into his body, transforming into the big, green giant! Adaptation of the Marvel comic book starts off so well as an intriguing human story on facing childhood demons, but then gets overridden by computer effects, and climax upon climax piles on that it drones on for an eternity. Well-acted and formatted as a comic book. Cameos by the original Hulk, Lou Ferrigno, and Marvel Comics contributor, Stan Lee. Running time: 138 minutes and rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence, some disturbing images, and brief partial nudity. ** ½",,9 May 2004
"Incredible!...No, Just kidding.","Overlong, ponderous and self-important adaptation of the Marvel Comic. Ang Lee attempts to graft depth and human psycho-drama onto what, prostestations of thirty year old plus comic book fans aside, should be popcorn entertainment. Psychoanalyitic BS therefore sits uneasily with arthouse atmospherics with lifeless results.

Perhaps Lee was under the impression that those attending 'Hulk' (no personal pronoun here for some reason) were after something more substantial than the usual one note comic book theatrics and all credit to him and writer James Schamus for not making a 120 minute pop video with the obligitory editorial flash and join the dots plot. Unfortunately intellectualising this kind of material tends to misjudge the target audience. Come on Ang, would a single joke have killed anyone?

Lee's effort is visually interesting attempting as it does to cinematically articulate the comic book look using various kinds of split screen techinques and transitions but, ironically given its pedigree the whole enterprise proves to be an empty confection of visual flourish and special effects.

Lee directs with an emotional detachment that would have made Kubrick look warm and humanist. Eric Bana is so busy looking serious and showcasing Banner's inner angst that he forgets to actually give his characterisation any personality. Ditto for Jennifer Connelly who as Betty Ross makes no impact whatsoever. Nick Nolte, the real Hulk of the picture, overacts to such a degree he blows everyone else off the screen but comes across as embarassing in the process.

As for the Hulk himself no, he doesn't look photorealistic but then he never was given the level of technology on hand. Incidently his 'performace' is probably the best thing in this humourless and ultimately souless picture.",,29 July 2003

Decent but ending was terrible,"Im a old comic book fan so by nature i am willing to like comic-book movies. I really expected this movie to really be bad though. It really wasnt. I could see they made an attempt to make it really good. They fell a little short though but The Hulk is really one of the most challenging comics to bring to life. I mostly found it pretty entertaining though. At times the Computer Generated Hulk was scary good, other times it was hokey looking..but i figured that would be the case going in..it just wasnt nearly as good as the CG Golum in lord of the rings. The real bummer about this movie is a otherwise pretty valliant attempt to make a real good movie kinda went down the drain with the ending which was terrible. It was dark, kinda incomprehensible, and just made me feel like the 1st 2hrs all went for naught. Nothing worse than making a high budget movie and then letting it go down the tubes with a less than climactic make shift couldnt think of a good way to end the movie ending. The one nice thing is they didnt make this as hollywood corny as i feared they might. But this movie wont knock Spiderman and Batman #1 off the top of the comic-book movies.",,28 June 2003
It's not as bad as one would think...,"Well now, let us look at the positives. The story brings in the great tale of Bruce Banner and a modern retelling of how he has come to be. The editing gives the film a feel that only a comic book could provide. Jennifer Connely looks stunning in some scenes. Serious moments in the film contain intense emotions sometimes and one truly feels sorry for the characters. The Hulk's fight scenes are wonderful and last but not least, the scenery is very nice...

Some of the negatives -The acting could use a little help, especially Eric Bana and Connely needed to lay off of the crying -Overuse of editing -Hulk's fighting scenes needed to be longer -Two good parts of the movie happen to be too dark for my vision

Other than that I would give this movie a 6 out of 10. Not the best marvel movie but I still feel it was well done. Thank you Mr. Stan Lee. Until then...later.",,15 July 2003
Reality Check Needed for Ang Lee and film goers...,"I can save you at least $8 right now. Don't go see this film. I did. It's not worth your time, your energy and definitely not worth your money. This film was made by the same guy who brought you the silly, ridiculous flight and fight movie, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. So unless you will buy into a 15ft. tall green cartoonish guy jumping so high that he is actually flying in the clouds, you will not like it. This is not a summer blockbuster, its just a buster. The CGI is nice, the film with the CGI is not however. It is totally unbelievable. This film is not even close to being on par with Xmen or Matrix, its actually quite sad when you realize after watching it that people actually spent money producing it in the hope that others will put up with the ridiculousness of it all.

Hulk was in some ways disappointing...but I still bought the DVD.,"Growing up in the 60s and reading the superhero comic books, I was really looking forward to the animation in the new movie release. After suffering through the Lou Ferrigno and Bill Bixby in the TV series, I couldn't wait to see the Hulk depicted the way he was intended to be...as Stan Lee had created him. There is no way that a real person could play the Hulk...he had to be animated. Our technology has finally come far enough that the Hulk could be shown in an almost ""realistic"" way.

I was somewhat disappointed with the acting and the story line, but remember that the first action hero movie of a possible series has to show how the hero came to be...this takes a little time. I do wish that more time had been put into writing a pretty good script. Despite all of this, I still bought the DVD. The Hulk was my favorite superhero...he could feel pain, weariness, confusion, anger...almost any emotion. This could be one movie that has a better sequel than the original.",,12 December 2003

THE HOAX more like!,"I shed a tear for what has become of a society can hold this up as ""acceptable cinematic entertainment"" let alone those who wax lyrical about Ang Lee's ""great interpretation"" of the Marvel superhero genus, or as played by Eric Banana, the verdant braindead bovver boy!

You guys think Stanley Kubrick (thank GOD he's dead and missed this insult of a directoral hand-me-down), Ridley Scott, Fritz Lang, Alfred Hitchcock, Anthony Mann or Sir Carol Reed, would be in awe of this agonisingly botched and ill-conceived mess? - for such it is!

The fact that Jennifer Connolly and Sam Elliot hand in such dynamically credible and sincere performances only serves to highlight the shoddiness of the remainder of the project. Bana was charismatically aflame as CHOPPER, held more than his own in BLACK HAWK DOWN but here, is just so totally miscast and plastically synthetic for the most part, that the flick was behind the eight ball to start with. HIS was not the sole factored downfall however! The CGI (which after test screening, had to be re-shot - not surprisingly) are just so bad as to be initially laughable, then aggravating and finally - insulting! At last night's screening, half a dozen people left the theater at the point of ""old green eyes"" first incarnation. Many more followed as the would-be-Freudian King-Kong-clone wore on! I should have heeded the words of the girl at the sales desk. When I purchased the tickets I happened to mention ""I think I'll regret this!"" She smiled sweetly,

""Oh, you WILL sir!""

THE HULK, far from achieving its pretentious aim as an in-depth psychological drama wherein the hapless Banner contemplates his inner self and his seemingly inexplicable laboratory-rage, falls apart at the seams every which way (and speaking of ""seams,"" those shorts adorning THE HULK would suggest he was at one time a cross-dresser). Logic, good-humored comic action, basically FUN of every sort are crushed beneath Ang's self belief she is re-making ROCKY, WUTHERING HEIGHTS, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRA DAME with a touch of RE-ANIMATOR thrown-in for good measure. Anti-vivisectionists would not be kindly motivated by the interminable and unnecessarily cruel treatment of animals during the opening credits either.

I also found Ang's use of ""windowed"" split screen neither innovative or original...simply extremely annoying! Perhaps a last-ditch attempt to distract one from the non-events at hand.

One of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune to sit through. PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE and SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS had more going for them - in terms of ""honest cinema!""",,27 June 2003
Very Disappointing,"Hulk is a bad movie to begin with. The sub-plots are very stupid. Also it is confusing, complicated, and the acting is very poor in many parts of this movie.

After the success of Spiderman and X-Men they decided to make this movie, which was a bad idea. They use too many split screens and various camera angles at the wrong time and makes the movie a lot more confusing. But maybe because it's just that I don't like these comic book movies.

If this movie had a better plot, then maybe I would like it more. But the sub-plots were very poor. And the movie was long and boring for the most part.

Rated PG-13 What I think it should be rated and why: PG-13 for brief nudity and sci-fi action and violence.",,15 September 2003
"different, but great","I entered the movie theater with the same mood as I were going to watch spiderman or superman....so, i was kind of disappointed because the style of the movie is very very different from what I had expected. However, I would still say The Hulk is a great movie (probably better than spiderman), as it contains a moral lesson, which Spiderman lacks.",,23 February 2004
"Hulk- Newer, Bigger, Bolder.","In the Hulk, we get the newest C.G.I. effects, The latest in sound and thunder, and lots of rewriting. For longtime comic geeks like myself, there is an all new origin, where the Hulk ""genome"" is an offshoot of his fathers Genetic experimentation, and we get a long build up (actually starts in the credits) of the past in banner's childhood of experimentation by, with, and on the father, (Nick Nolte)which he passes onto the son, and throughout flashbacks (throuought the entire movie), we get to understand the relationship in its fullest. Flash ahead to adult Banner (and a great Stan Lee / Lou Ferrigno cameo) working on similar science as his father was, an accident in the lab, and the final release of the Hulk In all his green glory. No real Issues with the CGI animation, Looks good, gets REAL BIG, (as he should when he gets madder)and is not uncharacteristic of the character we know. He looks definitely different, and the face is not an attempt at a previous look, rather how Banna would look should this happen to him. General Thunderbolt Ross, the Army, the Girlfriend, (an Excellent Jennifer Conneley) all intertwine to conspire against the Hulk, Hulk reacts, stuff gets destroyed. Lots of Comic Book-esque Paneling in the Framing/Shooting, (A-la 24 And Phone Booth) And the father turns into someone similar to Marvel's villain ""The Absorbing Man"". Too many of the fights at night, to be completely satisfied, it's left open for the obvious sequel, and a sparse amount of actual Hulk dialogue (more, please...) leave me curious as to how the next one will play out. Enjoy.",,21 June 2003
"Hulka, Hulka of Angry Love","Overall: B- / 7 of 10 The big green machine finally gets his own big screen adaptation. The Hulk is about one mans' struggle with his unique inner forces and the physical effects that they have on him and the very world around him. Dr. Bruce Kensler (Eric Bana) is a gifted scientist using gamma rays to bring about a revolutionary leap in healing. Bruce it would seem has a problem with externalizing his emotions and early flashbacks and scenes dealing his failed love life with fellow Berkley scientist Betsy Ross (the stunning Jennifer Connelly).suggest that this guy might have some issues to deal with later. Of course (as always) the military get wind of their impending discovery and try to steal their thunder. Only to complicate things further is the fact that Glenn Talbot (Josh Lucas), who's in charge of snagging the project for the military, has a past with Miss Ross and works for Her father General Ross (Sam Elliot). This is a lot of plot for a `comic book' movie! But wait.there's more. It seems that poor orphaned Bruce is not such an orphan after all. Enter his mad scientist father (Nick Nolte) who helps kick start his sons life into a green haze of anger, deceit, tank throwing and jumping around like a bunny on steroids. Technical Aspects: The direction was a bit overstated and at times heavy handed. Ang Lee was a weird choice to helm this type of film. The overall effect is decent and the little extra visual flare gives The Hulk a little uniqueness visually. The script is good. At times it plods along and is somewhat deeper than your average comic adaptation. The acting was my favorite part of the film. Jennifer Connelly was very good with emotive facial reactions and the whole nine yards. Nick Nolte was every bit the mad scientist and a point towards the end I was waiting to hear him shout `it's alive, alive'. All the characters seemed to have their dramatic arcs. The photography was good with some nice shots of the southwest at the end. The editing I thought was a lot of fun. At times we are shown multiple images that give the film a comic book feel. This may detract from the experience for some people but I thought it was a highlight. The music score by Danny Elfman (who seems to be the man to turn to for comic book scores) is actually a little disappointing. Being a fan of his film work (especially his Tim Burton stuff) I thought the score was understated and lacked a solid theme or direction. My philosophy on movie music is a compliment to the visuals. But this score was a bit transparent. And finally the effects. Thankfully the visual effects were not as bad as the previously released trailers and looked very good at times. The Hulk was totally computer generated and looked excellent while standing still or in limited motion. During the `hulk smash' scenes the believability factor takes a nose dive. One scene was a little annoying the Hulk vs. the devil dogs was so over generated that I was having King Kong on Monster Island flashbacks. (which would have been cool if Harryhausen had did it). Overall I was happy with the film. It turned out to be a lot better than I have figured on and think we might be on track for a hell of a sequal. Now after this long winded review I must collapse.now if I could only find Jennifer's lap to fall into.",,21 June 2003
Lack of Story Brings Down FX Beast,"Despite spectacular special effects and a gripping character concept, this film is tedious to sit through due to a slow moving and unsurprising plot. The characters were unmoving, not due to the actors' lack of talent, but because they had so little to work with. This is yet another movie (see Matrix: Reloaded, Star Wars: Attack of the Clones) where the plot suffers because the creators get too entranced with the special effects and tailor the script to serve them instead of the other way around.",,7 July 2003
Different But Excellent,"I'll admit this film wasn't what I expected when walking into the theater. It was slow to start off, but once it got going it certainly gave you bang for your buck. Ang Lee's direction is unlike anything I have ever seen. The Hulk plays like a live action comic book. Several panels of different angles and shots fill the screen at any time. Lee uses a huge load of different transitions between shots that to some people would seem strange and unusual, but work very well. All roles are acted very well, especially Sam Elliot as General Ross, and the story never slumps, but continues along at its own even pace. You have all probably heard about the CGI and that its cheesy or whatever. I am honestly telling you it is some of the best computer generated images I have ever seen in my life. The Hulk is as real as possible. Besides, what else are they going to use to create a 12 foot talk green monster? A rubber suit? Stop motion? Anyways, of all comic book super hero film adaptations this one is different, but excellent. I highly recommend this film. 3 out of 4.",,28 June 2003
Incredible,"That's right, incredible is the keyword to describe this film. I remember seeing the Lou Ferengo clips and the cartoon. I remember taking the ride at Universal Studios. The plot is great, and the transitions are wonderful. Based on the comic book by Stan ""the man"" Lee (who appears cameo in this film along with Lou Ferengo). First, Universal brought FRANKENSTIEN (which was an inspiration to the Hulk), DRACULA, and THE MUMMY. Then in the 40's Universal thrilled us with THE WOLFMAN, and the 1943 remake of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. In 1954, THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON. And in 2003 Universal thrilled us with a new humanoid beast, the Hulk. This film has shades of DR JEKYL AND MR HYDE, FRANKENSTIEN, and KING KONG. I was thrilled when I saw the title fight some hulk-dogs, and saw an amazing climax in which I cannot tell, because I will spoil it for you. Green was in fashion in the summer of 1998 with GODZILLA, and now it is back in 2003 in HULK. The transitions were amazing. It was like looking at a comic book or something. Ang Lee is excellent. This picture should get nominated or something. Well I took care of the pros and now the cons: the CGI creature looks like something from a Play Station game or a fuzzy cartoon. But no problem. It looks kind of realistic. Before I saw this film, I made a home movie in 2002 which was an assignment for Spanish, and I said, you won't like me when I'm angry in Spanish! It was called FRUSTRACION, meaning ""Frustration"". To see more of my comments on superhero movies from Marvel. See DAREDEVIL, X -MEN 2, and at the old domain called Matthew, SPIDER-MAN. Coming soon, X-MEN. Magazines like STARLOG, and MAD make fun of it.",,24 December 2003
"Insulting CGI from a movie-goer perspective, sans comic book fans","I am going to get right to the point and state something about the use of CGI in the theatrical release of ""The Hulk"" which others have hinted at, but not directly addressed.

The use of CGI within this movie truly insults me as a movie afficianado. Hollywood think tanks, future movie maskers and present day studio heads, take notice of what I am about to say because this serves as a warning about current trends in cinema.

I recall sitting in the theatre a few weeks back prior to release watching the trailer for this movie. The moment the Hulk character appeared onscreen I heard some in the audience exclaim, ""That looks cool."" Right after that comment came groans from numerous others, demonstrating discourse and ambiguity between viewers. In other movies I saw with this trailer, the same thing happened - a couple of positive gut reactions followed by moans, groans. My immediate reaction to the trailer was how rediculous the character looked.

So why are movie-goers so polar opposite about this movie? After watching a few audiences as my interest peaked as to what these reactions meant, it struck me. What's going on with all this?

My first thought was I was 36 years old, no longer a kid, and hopelessly out of touch with the joy of comic book heros and escapist summer blockbuster movie experience. I wondered if I was *old*, what was wrong with *me* to react so negatively to the computer generated graphics presented within this film? I loved comic books as a kid, and really enjoyed the TV version of ""The Hulk"". I also grew up with Hollywood summer blockbusters, tremendously enjoyed the use of CGI in ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Shrek"", ""Star Wars Episode II"" and so forth. I also enjoy quality acting, know the difference between pure entertainment and Academy Award winning dramas and what to expect from each. I recognize the value of the escapist entertainment dollar versus serious film making, and how to enjoy it on their own level.

Knowing I saw the trailer with an open mind, fully expecting explosions and choppers flying about and the inevitable use of CGI to create a Hulkish monster... I was disgusted. And so were many others in the audience, with all those groans.

The reason is very simple - it doesn't work with the other elements of this movie.

You see, the director, Ang Lee, clearly had a vision to clone the comic book interpretation of the character and adapt and integrate it seamlessly within a live action film with human actors and real scenery. That's the goal of CGI these days, to blend the virtual and real worlds on celluloid. I have no problem at all with Lee's use of comic panes, his directorial style and even the plot driven 45 minutes talked about so often in other user comments posted here on IMDB. I also respect his decisions to blend all these elements into the final product - it's his artistic vision. I respect art, always.

Buy his vision is seriously flawed in one main aspect:

The choice to morph the man into a large comic-book style monster in a world of normal sized men, machinery and background is plain wrong. Then only way to fulfull his vision was to use CGI, but doing so in this particular context, a live action action/drama, only serves to exploit the technology. In a blatantmanner.

The reason I am insulted by this movie is the studio that produced it is telling me to accept completely un-natural looking characters in a movie where a man is one half of that character's existence. You're placing a comic book art form directly inside another art form, and the two worlds collide. Terribly and embarrassingly for Ang Lee.

This decision was a bad one on an artistic level, although as others have stated I give credit for trying. The technology is not as issue here, it's the director's vision that is. The use of that technology in this context.

If Lee had chosen to CGI enhance the live actor slightly, or created a more realistically human Hulk, that would have worked much better in terms of the overall look of the film. Or, alternately, an entire CGI world where the Hulk is in the ""comic book"" scope of artistic vision.

Directors, future film makers and computer graphics designers, let ""The Hulk"" serve as an important lesson to you:

Use the technology to enhance a film, but keep the artistic vision within one plane of existence, or context. Feel free to experiment with independant films, but don't try this on huge multi-million dollar blockbuster extravaganzas that include Oscar winning movie actors.

In this case, the actors were fine, the CGI itself was excellent, but the context in blending the two was a tragic philosophical mistake in artistic vision since the subject matter is comic book influenced.

All those groans were from people like me realizing that the Hulk monster simply came across looking ""silly"" considering the other visual elements and actors also shown in the brief trailer.

Now, many reviewers are coming out and using words like ""rediculous"" to describe this specific use of CGI in this specific film.

Spending $8-$12 for a ticket to see this bona-fide breakdown in concept for this flick only disgusts me. I want everyone to know that this film insults my intelligence - and I love, adore, new technology as well as artistic experimentation.

I'm just saying a film this big, released this time of the year, with so much forced-fed advertising and obnoxious budget (years in the making) is not the place to try.

The groans are the votes by movie fans all over the world who know when they've been suckered.",,21 June 2003
GREEN GOLIATH!!!!,I saw HULK yesterday on opening day and I must say that it exceeded my expectations!! I love Lou Ferrignou but this HULK can topple tanks and gain size as his vicious rage progresses!! Do yourself a favor and get into this series cause I know there will be a sequel that will be even better!!!!,,21 June 2003
Ang Lee's bold direction cannot save it,"The Hulk, starring Eric Bana as the Mean Green, is a disappointing movie. Ang Lee, inspired director of Sense and Sensibility and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, had some good ideas for this movie. He decided to present this as a living, active comic book, sometimes using the panels like they do in the actual books. But a weak screenplay, and a horrible performance by Eric Bana (who's also equally horrible in Troy), as well as a freakishly confusing and inconsistent plot, make this movie a above-average disappointment. Eric Bana seems to think that acting is scrunching up your face and looking worried, and Jennifer Connelly and Nick Nolte, two talented actors, cannot save themselves from falling into the weakness of this script. The ending, in short, is unnervingly disappointing and ambiguous. However, the real faults of this movie lie in what cannot be said. Ang Lee does not do well with American blockbusters because American blockbusters rarely have room for anything but immediacy. (and the immediate thrills it provides are chaotic more than thrilling). This movie tries to be more than it is, and in the end is less than it has any right to be. Also, I have never seen a movie that seemed so long before. It was boring, even though people kept jumping around and beating each other up. My grade: 5/10",,6 June 2004
Before you watch this movie read some history about the Hulk and then judge the movie.,"I've seen this movie twice and I've read almost all the comments here about the Hulk. Most of these reviews just don't make any sense at all. There are more stupid negative reviews then well though out positives ones. All I read is that the movie is slow,it drags,its boring,the plot stinks,the actors are awful,the CGI is weak,the ending terrible, its this, its that, gimme a break. Its amazing that no matter how good or perfect a movie is made, there's always gonna be people saying its stinks. I understand people are entitled to their own opinion but come on people be realistic. This movie showcases a plot and character based on a comic book that was created in 1962.It also uses info from other Hulk comics to help the story. This is not a plot that was created outta the blue,its been around long before any of us were born. All Ang Lee did was recreate a newer,better,more impressive version of the Hulk from 1962 and what a job he did. Forget about the Hulk TV series, that was good for its time but it really wasn't the Hulk from the comics. If you were expecting to sit down with some popcorn and watch Bruce Banner turn into the Hulk the first ten minutes of the movie with mindless smashing action the rest of the way, your an absolute moron. So many complaints about more action was needed and that this is suppose to be comic book movie with more action then talking. Comics books have stories to them, they are not just stupid action fight scenes one right after another. The Hulk movie is a story that is well told visually and through dialouge. Each event is broken down nicely for everyone comic fans and non comic fans to understand where everything began for Bruce Banner and how he became the Hulk. If you know anything about Bruce Banner/Hulk and the characters that surrounded him in the comics then you should love this movie cause its well done. All these comic book movies are plots that were told in 1st issue comics and other issue of that character from the 60's & 70's. The directors may change and tweak a few things here and there but there basicly the same thing. Spider Man,X-Men,Daredevil, and the Hulk are plots that have made excellent transitions to the big screen. I realize a lot people are not interested in comics books movies and they find movies like this stupid but The Hulk is without question is a 10. Its got drama,action,thrilling anticipation,super great SFX and most importantly a perfect looking Hulk from the comics.",,1 July 2003
Somewhat Disappointing,"After seeing ""The Hulk,"" I'm left with mixed feelings. Yes, the film has its moments, but it also has it's problems. By no means is it perfection. Staying in the trend of recent comic book adaptations(Spider-Man, Daredevil, etc.) the Hulk leaves much to be desired as it never delivers what its trailers promise. I was very excited about the Hulk, as it is Ang Lee and I really loved ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" Its marketing campaign was one of the largest I had ever seen and it is almost like I was subliminally told to see the Hulk. Expecting a large crowd, I arrived at the movie theater two hours prior to the beginning of the film, but to my surprise there was no one there. I could of should up ten minutes before and gotten fairly good seats for my group of five.(I don't think this is a good sign.) Anyways, once the film started I knew I was going to have some issues with it.

First of all, the ""beginning"" of the film was a near half hour long. It just seemed to start as the film score kept playing the same motif over and over. For lack of a better term, it just got boring. The Hulk started without a bang and it had a hard time trying to achieve it. It delved into basically a synopsis of Bruce Banner's life, spanning his birth, childhood, and adolescence. It slowly made its way to the present time. As it reached this point, I thought to myself, ""Finally I'll get to see the Hulk."" An hour had passed and still no Hulk and it was making me angry. I felt like I would turn into the Hulk as I waited for the Hulk to finally appear. Eventually, Bruce Banner gets zapped by gamma radiation, but instead of actually showing this the film cuts away. An hour and a half passes by and no action has commenced. Finally, Bruce Banner hulkifies, but all he does is smash up his laboratory and run away. The film just kept dragging on like this. Lots of talking, then a small action scene, then some more talking. It moved incredibly slow and it became quite annoying. The editing of the film is not as bad as people are saying it is. The way the screen is set up like a comic book is actually interesting. However, after a while, it becomes tiresome as it begins to show four different angles of something that doesn't need such attention. Ang's idea would have been more effective in moderation, but instead it becomes unnecessary.

The Hulk is a decently acted movie. Eric Bana isn't a bad Hulk by any means. He does show some inner turmoil as he portrays his ability as more of a curse than a gift. Jennifer Connely is usually good in everything she's in, and there is no exception with The Hulk. Although, it was hard to believe her as a scientist. Nolte plays David Banner maniacally and does a good job at it, even though he seems drunk throughout the film. General Ross seemed typecasted for Sam Shepard as he embodies what the General is all about and Josh Lucas' Talbot is as well effective as a catalyst for Bruce Banner's transformation. However, these characters are all secondary to what needed to be the star of the film, The Hulk himself. The CGI Hulk often looked more like Shrek than a horrible beast, but you do get used to him. His transformations are done well, as some real emotions are shown. What I found interesting though, is that I had expected the close-up Hulk to look bad when really I felt that the far away hulk looked the jerkiest. The few times the Hulk speaks, it is pitiful. The writers should have realized that if the Hulk was going to speak once or twice, what he said needed to be golden. Other than that though, I was impressed by the CGI work on the Hulk, but it is a different story for the ""Hulk dogs."" They really just looked bad, but it was often hard to tell because the fight which included them is very dark, which caused difficulties in making out what was happening. However, when I could see them their flaws were painfully obvious.

The scope of the Hulk is truly amazing and Ang Lee's visionary movie making is shown. Where the Hulk fails is plot. It is hard to enjoy a movie that is dull and uninteresting. Every time the Hulk began showing glimpses of glory, the film would slow down and drain any interest I once had. There were no edge of your seat moments. I commend Lee on trying to reinvent the superhero genre, but many of his attempts fall flat. That is why this film becomes somewhat disappointing. If you're looking for an action filled movie, don't see the Hulk, but if you're one who enjoys character driven films, this movie is your cup of tea.

?/10 - I couldn't decide on a number.",,21 June 2003
"Dreadful, tedious rubbish.","Does a director ever sit and watch the finished product and say ""no, sorry this is embarrassing I can't put this out""? Well Hulk is the best example recently of when he should have.

Slow, tedious, contrived and fragmented build up - after 30 minutes I would have walked out if I wasn't in the centre of the row. There then followed two hours of cliched 'good guy against the state', bad guy rival scientist/love interest pap. Over directed and with some teeth sucking typecast Sam Elliott pieces mixed with outrageous and cringeworthy hamming from Nick Nolte.

It was as though they said ""right its taken 12 years to get about 20 minutes of really cool cgi stuff, what should we wrap around it with the last $100 we have left in the budget?"".

Eric Bana is hopelessly miscast (""his name sounds similar so he must be the right guy"") and Jennifer (I'm ready for my close up, who has the wind machine?) Connolly will not remember this as one of her finest acting performances.

The best bits were the cameo by Lou Ferringo at the start and the credits.",,13 July 2003
Nice Grafix for a Pitiful Movie,"I saw the trailer to this movie and expected it to be good. I payed a good $7.50 to see this 2 hr waste of my life. There is really nothing but talkin and boring information happening for the first hour of the movie, and i was actually beginning to fall asleep in the uncomfortable chairs at the movie theater.As i was dozing off 'Bam!' he starts to fight a few poodles... who's stupid idea was that anyway? From then on the movie pretty much consisted of a big green guy who looked totally c.g. jumping about 1 mile and smashing tanks and helicoptors to peices. Well! when u FINALLY get to see him fight his dad all you get is a big bubble lookin thing that sems to be takin the green guys 'energy' or 'power', and he VERY PREDICTABLY explodes. Right.

Ya my one line summary pretty much sums it up from here.

"So well-explored, and yet so hollow.","This film was strange. Even though the filmmakers used lot of advanced film-techniques to take us back and forth in time, splitscreen etc., in the end it was incredibly hollow, and the Hulk himself was disappointing, perhaps because his nature was to get angry, green and run and jump all over the place without getting hurt, and it was boring. Or was it all the whining from the actors? (Bana, Connelly, Nolte - not Elliott) In the end, it was sterile, unfulfilled and unsatisfying.",,16 August 2003
Another Comic Story Movie,,,25 February 2007
Three words: Boring as hell,"This had the potential for a good movie. Good graphics, good fame, and good advertising. There's only one thing it lacks - A PLOT!

I've never read very many Marvel comics, so it's not coming from a biased opinion. I really enjoyed both X-Men movies and Spiderman was ok. The Hulk was boring, with a skeleton of a plot. My friends and I left in the middle of it and went to Stage, and came back for the ending. No surprise, it was still boring as hell. I'm glad we left.",,8 July 2003
A Green Breather amidst the Hollywood-Choke-Hold,"Sitting in the theater watching ""Hulk"" for the first time I noticed this grumpy noise next to me followed by the comment: ""this i kind of boring..."" or something along those lines.

I don't know, it seems that we've become less and less aware of classical storytelling. Even if it hits you in the face like this beautiful adaptation of a beloved comic-book hero. I think, and I don't believe I'm romanticizing, but there was a time when you could actually MARVEL at what Hollywood was able to do (and I'm talking about kinetic popcorn storytelling like Indiana Jones, Lethal Weapon and Die Hard, movies of not so long ago).

These days very few big budget movies actually have something (or anything) to tell. It's showcasing on a grand scale, and even the comedy has become cruel and unusually bad at times. This has happened so often, that there seem to be a lot more people out there who prefer Charlie's Angels or the Bad Boys over a genuine hero. Agreed there are many aspects which one may criticize about ""Hulk"" but certainly not that it doesn't have an engaging story, or that this story is boring. If someone calls this boring, then they've must've been sucked so deep into the void of ""meaninglessness"" that they've lost all sense of watching and listening to somebody telling a tale.

I for one, and judging from the reviews am not alone, consider Lee's movie probably the best comic book adaptation ever, and for that matter it's probably one of the best literature adaptations of the year. It is broad, it is an adventure, but harbours an incredible soul. Jesus, even Spielberg's Indiana Jones-Movies (which set a precedent for modern day movie-entertainment) had their moments of character development. No matter how brief, but they actually gave the story some substance.

All I'm trying to say,in a bit of a preachy tone, is that this movie is a real rarity. It's entertainment with heart and character in all shapes and sizes. And it's kind of sad that it didn't find a bigger audience than it deserved. I don't think that there are fewer good movies out there today, but they are being squashed and driven out of the theaters by the enormous amount of crap that's being produced by ""The-Boys-And-Girls-Out-in-California"".

You can't argue about taste, and the successful movies provide jobs in the industry. But...can't you guys try a little bit harder to tell stories? I mean if you look at Terminator 3, the Angels, anything with a number at the end of a title; it's all the same, and rarely engaging. Because after all the explosions there's hardly anything left...and I don't think that everybody out in Hollywood is just looking for a quick buck. But you have to care to actually pass by the incredible gauntlet of mediocrity. But should you succeed, you'd be hero yourself, even just for one day. Now, wouldn't that be something?",,6 August 2003
Disappointing,"Overall, this was a letdown. Like many superhero movies, this takes too long to get going, and just when it begins to get really good...its over. And this time with a tacked on, forehead-slappingly bad ending.

The biggest problem with this movie was the story...too much repressed memory mumbo jumbo that really wasn't necessary. I respect the fact that they were trying hard to give the film some weight and emotional depth, but in my opinion they failed. I couldn't care less about Banner's inner-struggle...it just took up space between brief Hulk sightings. As I've always said, of all the genres, there's nothing worse than watching bad drama.

Another problem was the comic-book style editing. I liked the split screens because they showed you different angles of what was going on and it was interesting. But the stupid freeze-frames that try to capture the feel of a comic panel? Annoying and cheesy looking. A movie isn't a comic book and doesn't have to look like one. Do book adaptations ever resort to typed passages of the text in the middle of the movie to make you feel like you're reading? No. They may use narration of the text, but that's audio and it fits in the medium of film. What it boils down to is when a guy gets blown up in a comic book movie, he should be thrown across the room, not frozen in a still frame with a white border around it. That is the kind of stuff that brings this film to a screeching halt at times.

Out of two hours and fifteen minutes, I'd say I enjoyed about forty minutes of this. The first couple of Hulk scenes? So-so. The dog fight? Pretty cool but too dark and confusing. The whole escape/desert chase? Right on. The ending? Oy.

Overall, a big disappointment. Better luck next time fellas. If there is one.",,5 July 2003

"THE HULK had it's good points, and it's bad points...","The Hulk

Rated PG-13, 2 hrs 18 min, Universal Pictures

When I heard that ANG LEE was in talks to direct a big-screen version of THE HULK I was ecstatic. It was about the same time that DARREN ARONOFSKY was rumored to be attached to a big screen version of one of my favorite comics of all time BATMAN: LEGENDS OF THE DARK KNIGHT, one of the darkest BATMAN books ever. I was on geek cloud nine. until..

ARONOFSKY fell thru on the BATMAN project and they announced THE HULK would be 100% CG. My cloud came crashing down.

While the verdict is still out on BATMAN, THE HULK is here in all its ANG LEE glory. Marvel has done us good.

THE HULK stars ERIC BANNA (CHOPPER) and JENNIFER CONNELY (REQUIEM OF A DREAM) as the primaries, with JOSHUA JACKSON and NICK NOTLE as the supp as well as a 100% CG HULK creation as the centerpiece.

In order to properly review this film, I first need to let you know that I went into this movie with extreme reservations. I was braced for the absolute worst. The CG in the trailers had been scarily unimpressive so far, and the marketing campaign was scaring me even more. They were advertising THE HULK, a movie about a guy who gets caught in a radiation accident that causes him to grow to immense sizes whenever someone makes him angry, in the exact same way that you would see perhaps, CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON or THE ICE STORM marketed. As an art-house flick. Could this be another expectation that could not be met? On top of the doomed CG?

I'm happy to report to you that THE HULK is not the abomination I thought it might be. The story is well paced and the characters are fully developed. In fact, THE HULK has turned out to be one of the most complete, human stories I have seen lately. All that and it still manages to be a big-budget action flick.

The movie opens in a laboratory on a military base somewhere in America, where an ambitious young scientist named David Banner (PAUL KERSEY) is sampling the DNA of starfish, snakes, mollusks and the like. Banner injects their genetic material into his own body, to be passed on, later, into that of his baby son, Bruce.

Years later, we find the young Bruce Banner (ERIC BANA) as the head of his own research team at Berkeley working on close to the same project as his father was all those years ago. We are also introduced to the future damsel in distress, a fellow scientist Betty (JENNIFER CONNELY). Both former military brats, and veterans of the mental abuse that seems to come packaged with being children of the military, have feelings for each other that they are holding back on for one reason for another. They are close to perfecting the perfect DNA warrior. So close, that the military is looking to take over their project.

In the midst of all this action (I love sarcasm), you have a side story brewing between Betty and her estranged father, General `Thunderbolt' Ross (SAM ELLIOTT). They haven't talked in years, and she asks him to get the military to back off her project and her man. In the meantime, a strange janitor shows up lurking around the laboratory, who just happens to be Bruce's father, fresh out of solitary confinement and ready to resume testing on his son. An accident happens in the laboratory, Bruce gets zapped and the HULK goodness begins.

Confused? It's not that bad when you are watching it all unfold on the screen. ANG LEE gracefully packs 2 hours of story within the first 30 minutes of the movie. The movie seems to flow like a comic book. From the camera angles that LEE has chosen, to the transitions that are used. You get the feeling that you are watching a living breathing comic book.

Think about comic books in general. They are a visual medium. You have a book, comprised of approximately thirty or so pages, each page comprised of a series of panels. The total story text in an average comic book can't be much more than a couple of your average `See Spot Run' children's books. Yet a comic book will tell a story, possibly from beginning to end, within a 15 minute read. That's how THE HULK plays, and in my book, it works.

The use of transitions is masterful. At one point using a helicopter blade as a wipe, and at other times moving from one scene to another using black bars, as if you were reading a comic book from one panel to the next. This trick was a big risk for ANG with loads of potential for such a `gimmick' to go horribly wrong.

Despite my apparent enthusiasm for the film, it does have its faults. The CG has issues, with the often-used `Overgrown-Shrek' analogy coming way to close to home for my tastes. In scenes near the beginning of the film the HULK fights off a trio of HULK-like-dogs in the dark forest. The CG works perfectly, keeping the Hulk amongst the shadows, never revealing his full frame, using close quick shots of his angry face and huge arms. The moments they show him in a fully lit room, or outside in the desert, the faults in the CG start to show. He looks rubbery, almost like he is ripped right out of a comic book, and then awkwardly cast in a movie, as opposed to the other way around. Maybe that was the effect LEE was aiming for?

For what it's worth, THE HULK was not the huge disappointment I feared it would be for me. The CG was close to a major problem, but the story and comic-book-like storytelling innovations ANG presents save the flick for me. Definitely worth a look for any film fan, even if you do not traditionally like comic book based films.

"""My son is unique, and the world will not tolerate his uniqueness.""","""My son is unique, and the world will not tolerate his uniqueness."" - David Banner

The above quote from the movie accurately sums up my impressions of the feedback this movie is recieving. The Hulk is unlike any other recently released comic book movie in story or tone. There's very little humor, the delivery is as straight and serious as can be, and there really isn't an identifiable big bad for the hero to face for almost the entire picture. It is unique, and I don't think people are ready for how different it is. However, I also think people forget what the Hulk comic was really like.

The Hulk comic, while I was reading it years ago, wasn't like most comic books. Alot of that repressed memory/rage and general mind/dream sequence stuff that you see throughout the movie happened quite frequently in the comic. One of my favorite sequences in the movie is when you see a door open in Banner's mind with the outline of the Hulk stepping into view. The door metaphor was a common occurrence in the comic. Remember how Mr. Fixit or the ""fusion"" of Hulk and Banner into the ""smart"" Hulk came about in the comics? It was mostly a cerebral event taking place abstractly within Banner's mind.

My point is that the comic always indicated that Banner was quite screwed up in the head, and this movie chose to focus on this attribute of the character instead of the exploits of the jolly green alter ego. The story here completely fleshes out the reasons why Bruce's psyche is damaged, albeit with some liberty taken from the source material. This aspect of the movie is like the comics in this regard. People that don't like the movie because of this are justified, because they do bring up valid points. Perhaps the director over-portrayed this aspect of the character to the detriment of the viewing audience expecting alot of ""Hulk Smash!"" and a gallery of super villains. However, this part of the movie isn't from out in left field. It really is keeping faithful with the comic, and the Hulk, especially at this stage, is just a manifestation of Banner's id. With this in mind, I enjoyed the pure exposition in the first half of the movie, and how it resolved itself in the pre-requisite, although short, final battle.

When the Hulk does show up, the movie pretty much turns into an action piece for the remainder of its run. The comic Hulk was an ordinance-proof behemoth who would continue to ""hulk out"" if he was made angrier, and traveled by leaping for miles. I think these aspects of the Hulk were captured well, and I really enjoyed the lengthy battle with the military, as I think most Hulk fans will. The cgi isn't perfect throughout, but I was able to maintain my suspension of disbelief.

I can perfectly understand why some people aren't enjoying this film. The movie is aimed towards a narrower target audience than most summer blockbusters. It's more of a character study of an emotionally distant man who happens to turn into a giant green monster rather than a movie about a bad guy bashing super hero who happens to be giant and green. It seems to be aiming towards the ""Unbreakable"" crowd end of the spectrum, although the pace of this is more brisk in comparison with much more payoff. However, like ""Unbreakable"", this isn't going to satisfy the masses.

Why did I hate this movie?,"The acting, with a few exceptions, was very good. The format for the scene changes I really enjoyed. But, after the first 45 minutes of the movie, I wanted my money back.

There is little to no comic relief in this movie. The cameo, the poodle, and the reference to the series where the only humorous elements (and the poodle wasn't that funny). I agree that witty, clever dialogue is generally overdone, but this is a bit to the other extreme.

I don't like any of the characters in the movie. I kind of like Nolte's character, but if that's the best there is, that is pretty sad.

This is not to say that I don't like dark movies with no likeable characters. I do, but they better have something deep and meaningful going on.

Bottom line I think is expectations. I don't go to see a movie based on a comic book to see a dark movie about how it can be bad to repress emotions.",,24 June 2003
Too many cooks spoil the broth?,"The idea looked good on paper: the oscar-worthy team behind ""CTHD"" and ""The Ice Storm"", working with veteran sci-fi producers Larry Franco and Gale Anne Hurd, with the full weight of Universal Pictures behind them, to bring to the screen ""HULK"".

Comic book movies, as a rule, tend to be watchable when the subject matter is taken seriously (X-Men, Batman, Superman I, II), and tend to be rubbish when the approach is campy (Superman III, IV, Batman & Robin).

I think in the case of HULK, they took it too seriously. The effort to transcend the comic book genre and give it serious emotional gravitas is commendable, and I think, a worthwhile endeavor. It certainly was more interesting than your run of the mill excretement churned out everyday. However, in the end, we are talking about a comic book movie, and despite the desire to base it in some sort of reality, you just can't escape the limitations of that medium. It's not as bad as most of the posters of users comments claim, but in my opinion I think most people tend to be dissapointed when they are asked to use a modicum of intelligence.

On a scale of ""Wretched"" to ""Wonderful"", I give HULK an ""OK"".",,29 October 2003
The only Incredible thing here is the spandex underwear.,"The Hulk is a contemporary remake of the action comic/TV character of the same name. Modern digital effects have come a long way since the 1970's and so the result should be worth seeing. Unfortunately, movement in the field of script-writing appears to be entirely retrograde.

The Hulk has the potential to be a smashing good action movie. Instead, it is a mish-mash of man vs. society, man vs. self and man vs. man. The real enemy of the Hulk morphs from the military, to a money-grubbing tech contractor, to his very own father, leaving viewers wondering who or what the Hulk will conquer next (God?).

This movie has the feel of something that's been re-written about two thousand times, by about two hundred different screen-writers. In fact, I would not be surprised if they were re-writing entire sections of script only weeks before the movie's release. The movie is disjointed, utterly lacking any sense of pace, and there is no real focus, other than the special effects. The result is boring and incredibly contrived.

Also worth mentioning is the ridiculous habit of Director Ang Lee of adding useless footage (a la The A-Team) of military types crawling, shaken but otherwise unharmed, from their demolished tanks and helicopters. This insulting bit of filmwork appears to be meant as an appeasement of the establishment. After all, it would be un-American for our hero to go around killing our brave fighting men (and women).",,5 July 2003
The word PATHETIC comes to mind.......,This movie is the pits. I thought the CGI would save it but I was wrong! I have discovered WHY they call him the MINDLESS HULK and its not because he smashes stuff. I have never given a minus rating before but this movie almost made me go there. I will instead give it a ZERO and that is being kind!,,16 July 2003
Bring back Bill Bixby!,"This will no doubt be this summers big hit in Sweden too. After having enjoyed other good adaptations of comic book heroes (Spiderman, X-men) my anticipations here high, especially since Ang Lee is the director and the film had some good reviews. I was incredibly disappointed. Here is why:

1 The film takes itself much too seriously. In movies like Spiderman, X-Men, Superman and Batman there is great deal of the childish humour a good comic-book-adaptation needs to have. Even the TV-series The Hulk was better at that then this film. Ang Lee tries to strike a poetic tone to the movie and make it into a relations drama. Big mistake.

2 Nick Nolte is even huskier than ever. When David Banner turns to stone I just laugh.

3 Eric Bana must be a worse actor than Bill Bixby, who at least had two looks in his face.

4 The Hulk grows way too big when he gets angry. He reminds me of King Kong at times. And what about this 'bouncing green giant'-thing? Ridiculous!

5 The computer graphics seem to be made 7-8 years ago. I expected much better (OK, his face is alright). When he fights the mutant dogs (and one is a poodle!) it simply becomes too much..

6 There are no nuances in the monsters behaviour. He is stark raving mad all the time, except when he sees dear Betty.

7 All parallells to Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde are just plain silly.

8 The film runs, naturally, way too long.

9 The only thing that reminds me of a comic-book is the typeface in the titles and the use of split-screens.

10 I'm so tired of crazy scientist in movies. Give me a film with a scientist-hero (modern Indiana Jones maybe?).

11 This music score is awful, just as pompous and bombastic as the rest of the film.

12 The ending is all too obvious. Why must we be told that there will be a Hulk 2?

Theory: Ang Lee doesn't get bad reviews, whatever he does.

Two goods things finally:

1 Lou Ferrigno's and Stan Lee's cameo appearances.

2 Sam Elliott is actually better than usual in this movie. He has built his entire career on leaning his head to one side, smiling in one corner of the mouth and peering. In this film he only does this once!",,30 June 2003
"Great, but not to everyones liking!","As most of you have read the the affect of this film has not been as large as expected. Some has praised the film and director Ang Lee on a job well done. However many comic book fans were less impressed with it's 'more drama less action' aprroach. Personally I found the film to be very watchable, yet a little long and slow in places! The CGI was impressive and the fact that it took 40 to 45 mins for the Hulk to appear wasn't really an issue! The story and action went along smootly till his arrival so I din't feel as if the wait was long. However wen the film hit the hour mark, things became very slow and hard to watch as the story jumped around! All in all watch the film as it is enjoyable with a good story and action, but be warned the end is a bit of a anti-climax and I feel a few die hard Hulk fans may feel a little cheated by the lack of action.

Finally rating 7/10",,16 July 2003
This film should be green with envy of `Spiderman.',"Don't even hope Ang Lee's adaptation of the Hulk comic book will be as remotely entertaining or humanistic as ""Crouching Tiger."" It is not. If my 15-year-old grandson, Cody, gives it a C+, and he goes into the film with the most positive attitude, then you know something is wrong.

The setup is almost 40 minutes; that is it takes that long to give background and establish the conflict, and then we see Bruce Banner (Eric Bana of `Chopper') transformed by anger into The Hulk. After some rousing sequences of Hulk bounding over the country side and engaging some mean dogs (who have the same genetic mutation) in serious video-game-like wrestling, we are left with inane interaction between Hulk and his love, Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly, 'A Beautiful Mind'), and her over-the-top 5-star general father, overplayed by Sam Elliott, without handlebars on his moustache.

Watching Nick Nolte (`The Good Thief') overact as Hulk's father and bad-boy scientist is the most amusing part of the film. His hair is the same fright style immortalized by the LAPD mug shot of Nolte after his swerving Malibu run.

I'm digging here for something redeeming to say: Maybe the CGI, which handles most of Hulk's appearance, is not as phony or overpowering as some have been complaining. Also, the frequent split-screen panels simulate the comic-book experience. The monster looks realistic enough, the parallels to the Frankenstein motif are obvious, and the moments of King Kong and his love are reprised gently. Otherwise, this film should be green with envy of `Spiderman.'",,21 June 2003
"So much potential, so much disappointment.","I had been awaiting this movie with a lot of excitement. After ""X-Men,"" ""X2"" and ""Spider-Man,"" I don't think that my expectations were unreasonable. After all, the Hulk is perhaps the most compelling, the most human of all of Stan Lee's great creations. With a world-class director like Ang Lee on board, how can it miss, right? Well, it missed.

It's tough to put my finger on what exactly sinks this movie. Is it the dialogue? Well, maybe. It is pretty atrocious. But the same could be said of ""Spider-Man."" I was able to forgive it in that instance because the dialogue for all its badness really did evoke the comic book.

Is it the performances? I don't really think so. Eric Bana certainly doesn't overwhelm one with his ability. He really doesn't seem to be a skilled enough actor to pull off the complexity of Bruce Banner--calm waters on the surface and raging underneath. Still, he does okay. Jennifer Connelly sucks, but my heart goes out to anyone who has to try to animate a token comic-book love interest (for all the little exceptions, comics are overwhelmingly a boy's playground). On the seniors tour, Sam Elliott is solid and Nick Nolte is actually fantastic.

Is it the special effects? No. I know some people have complained about them, but I thought the action scenes looked great and, most importantly, I really thought all the humanity and pathos of the Hulk came through. I would question the decision to take away his speech (I kept waiting for ""Hulk just want to be left alone!!!""), but Lee's hands-on approach to the CGI and careful attention to facial expressions really pays off.

Is it the story? Probably more likely, although I think ""structure"" is a better word for it. Something about the pacing doesn't work--the exposition in the opening credits is far too fast and everything else seems far too slow.

I was reminded of ""The Mask,"" or any other movie where the protagonist periodically transforms. The unfortunate, unavoidable reality in movies like this is that the audience is very excited for the scenes where the protagonist becomes this supernatural character and incredibly bored and impatient when he's not. Nolte's ferocious, Chuck Manson/ranting homeless guy performance was the lone exception to this for me. Beyond that I found myself counting the seconds between Hulk scenes.

I'm not one to get pissy when movies based on books/comics/whatever don't follow the original that closely. If you want the comic, read the comic. I respect that you have to make adjustments for the screen. In fact, a cinematic addition (Nolte's character and the related storyline) wound up being one of the most compelling elements in this otherwise unsatisfying movie. HOWEVER, I'm wondering if some effort should have been made to include a villain from the comics (The Leader? I dunno.), if for no other reason than to give the film a clearer climax. I left wondering what the hell had just happened.

At the end of the day, I guess this ambitious experiment of pairing a world-renowned ""artsy"" director with a superhero was just too ambitious. I hate to say it, but I really think that this material is kind of beyond Lee's grasp, or that his grasp is beyond it.",,23 June 2003
I'm getting sleepy oh wait here we go!,"The first hour of the movie sucked!!It was slow moving, nothing interesting at all. Who's the target audience? Surely they didn't expect little kids to sit through that first 90 minutes of boring, slow, scientific jargon. You can show up an hour into the film and think it was one of the best.

Once Banner finally became the Hulk for the first time he change almost ever other five minutes. This was cool. I loved watching huge green beast destroy everything. If it wasn't for the Hulk being so cool this movie would totally suck, I mean it only be worth a 1 for effort, but the hulk scenes made it decent enough if you can get through the first hour---6 out of 10",,1 July 2003
You're making me tedious.. They wont like me when I'm tedious!,"Take one dark brooding anti-hero hero, mix well with two wacked out dads and a daughter/girlfriend and you have Ang Lee's gothic pseudo-drama called HULK. TMI!!! I'm sorry, there was way too much info about the Machiavellian melodrama known as the Banner household. The movie looked more like Lost Highway meets Twin Peaks meets the Jolly Green Giant for coffee at the Baghdad Cafe. Kudos to the special effects guys, the transformation scenes were flawlessly edited, the slim down in San Francisco was beautifully conceived. And what's with that woman wailing in the HULK ""love theme"" sounding more like left-over DUNE soundtrack than anything original.

Eric Bana, hey, his name sounds like someone from Cape Cod saying ""Banner""..spooky...was great as the troubled genius cursed by his fathers machinations while a genetic scientist hack working for the military.

Nick Nolte was ludicrously cast as the aging homeless-looking wreck who comes back ostensibly to save his son but has deeper personal motives.

Looking very comic book in her two dimensional 5 mile stare.. Jennifer Connelly displayed none of the talent that won her an Oscar nod in A Beautiful Mind. The pregnant pauses were too pregnant, and speaking of which, there should have been a passing on of the torch so to speak between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross, with the resultant little Hulksters wreaking havoc in pre-school, destroying school busses when the driver asks them to get quiet or sit down. Oh well, another sequel idea down the drain.

And what can I say about Sam Elliot? You should have stopped at Lonesome Dove. I would have rather seen R. Lee in the role, at least he could have supplied something besides basso-profundo mutterings and weak-sister platitudes and offerings of love to his very mixed up daughter Betty. And what's with that moustache Sam? Can't afford Just For Men Beard and Moustache?

Finally, why Ang thought to film some scenes in darkness to the point of relying on highlights from moonlight to see anything is not artistic, it's irritating. The mutant dog attack and the final conflict between David and Bruce was almost impossible to make out. Maybe the scenes were deliberately darkened so that some money could be saved on the special effects. It is easier to conceive a big green guy in darkness than in bright sunlight I guess.

I will wait for the DVD and watch it in a silent home theater environment. Despite it's comic book appeal, the movie IS NOT FOR KIDS, sorry Mom and Dad, spring for a baby sitter and enjoy this DARK and BROODING HULK of a film by yourself, and give other theater-goers a break.",,20 June 2003
"Critically praised, commercially trashed...","This is an excellent comic-book adaptation. I'm in my early 20s and have been a die-hard Hulk fan since the age of three when the cartoon series appeared Saturday Mornings alongside Spider Man and His Amazing Friends. I can understand why non-hulk fans might find it slow or disappointing, dark and depressing, and lacking a sense of humor.

But in all honesty, that's true to the character in the same way Sam Raimi's film is true to the Spider-Man character. Bruce Banner/Hulk is truly a tragic figure, a misunderstood monster representing repressed emotion as a opposed to a flat-out super hero. The Hulk is portrayed almost flawlessly as he appears in the comics, right down to all his fantastic powers (leaping three miles, impervious to harm, amazing feats of strength) and I can let slide the new additions that director Ang Lee made (for instance his size, which is too big, and his ability to get larger with anger, which does not exist in the comic book).

I agree some of the best action sequences are lost to darkness, and the end is certainly anti-climactic after the amazing desert sequence. But, if you're looking for a true-to-comic-book film, this ranks right alongside Spidey and X-men. If you can get past the necessary alterations Ang Lee made (using genetics instead of radiation in terms of triggering Bruce's initial transformation, for instance, or the manipulation and slight alteration of the father storyline) then this is a winner.

It's just a shame that critics loved it, but audiences seemed to have ignored it after the first weekend, although it still made a boatload of box-office. 9/10",,3 September 2003

Don't Listen Negative Reviews,"Excellent film, slow in the beginning, once it starts rolling it's amazing! About 90% true to the comic. Slight changes to fit the screen and make it a ""film"" more than a ""movie"". I loved the Hulk, his movements and fight scenes were great.",,23 June 2003
I may tick a lot of folks off but...,"This movie is reprehensible! The Hulk was a 2 hour waste of my time, it was probably only 45 minutes but it felt like 1 1/2 before we even got to see the beast! The acting was way over the top, the script was non-existant, the CGI made Hulk out to be a big, steaming, green turd that just stunk up the screen!

Nick Nolte as the Unabomber/Bruce's Dad was beyond belief, and he was an oscar-award winning dramatist compared to the rest of the cast.

I'm a comic book fan and I was just saddened by this film. Blade and Blade 2, X-men and X2, Spider-Man, Daredevil.

Great movie,"If you're expecting another Spiderman or X-men, then you will be disappointed. I applaud Ang Lee of trying to make this movie his own, and not copying the popcorn comic-book movie formula. Unlike Peter Parker, Bruce Banner/The Hulk is a tragic figure. The movie is dark, much like the great first Batman movie. The visuals are impressive. The new looks (split screens, transitions, etc.) are fresh. I don't understand how people can say the special effects are bad. Spiderman looked more fake than the Hulk (when Spidy was flying around town, you could clearly see he was CGI). The Hulk is beautiful to watch. Some of the scenes are so beautiful you cannot forget the images. My only gripe is that Ang Lee held back showing us more of Hulk.

I think the psychological drama adds to the movie. Sure it's dark and moody, and that may turn away a lot of audience who expects more fun.

Yes, if you expect another Spiderman, you will be disappointed. Otherwise, this could be the next level for comic-book movies.",,19 June 2003
I'm embarassed to spend money to see such a crumby movie.,"I liked comic books when I was a kid, but I never understood the appeal of a big green/gray giant that smashed things.

Disaster,"This might be the worst movie I have ever seen. I understand and respect comic books, I understand that the characters all have backstories, but for its own good it only needed a synopsis of the super heroe's life, but ultimately when you go to see The Hulk, you want to see action. You want to see a huge green beast destroying buildings, because thats what you expect and thats what it was advertised as. This movies strikes me as something trying to be more than it is. The makers of this movie had to realize that they werent supposed to make a damn Oscar film, and by trying to make it whole, they made it dull instead. I sat there, riding out the storm in the theater, waiting for the idiot to turn green already. By the time he actually did turn green, I just wished he would lose one of his mediocre battles so that the movie would just end. It was an endurance test, and Jennifer Connely and Nick Nolte are the ONLY good things out of this movie, and I feel sorry for them having tarnished their names on it.

I walked out of the theater in pure awe of what I had just seen. The director actually did a decent job with the technical side, considering it was supposed to seem like a comic book. Unfortunately, bad writing can cast a shadow over any directing. It killed the movie. It took a action movie with killer potential and turned it into a vapid wanna-be drama. And by the time it actually did turn into an action movie, it was actually pretty well done. Again, unfortunately, nothing could pull the shipwreck of a script out of the water.

Terrible movie, steer clear",,15 July 2003
The Most Imaginative Super Hero film ever,"Yep, its true. Maybe I'm a sucker for the stylish split screens, or maybe I just like to see the Hulk jumping around canyons. This my friends, is one heck of a movie. Before it came out, most of the talk was about the CGI, namely that of the Hulk. Well, ILM have excelled themselves, infact, the main player is all CGI and from the first minutes he's on there you sorta forget that. You believe he's a real character and there's lots of genuinely touching moments in this film. Interesting to see that most of the Humans in this movie are angry, adrenaline driven monsters whereas the Hulk is fairly timid. He just wants to get at those people who are attacking the ones he loves the most. A paradox that was evident in the TV show and one that's been successfully replicated in this movie. I loved the use of Split screens too. For once they were used in a movie and they actually made sense. It makes you believe you're watching a real life comic book. When the Hulk first makes his entrance I thought the action scenes were ok but thought maybe Ang Lee nailed the character side of the movie but the action might be sorely lacking. Mid Way through the genuinely terrifying dog scene those fears were quickly dispelled. This guy can do action and take it to the extreme. Anyone worrying that this film would have no humour and be 100% straight as a dye will have their worries dispelled too.from a certain point of view. You see, this is the genius of this film. The humour is in the vein of The Royal Tennenbaums. It doesn't give you a musical cue to laugh, neither does the director throw a joke in your face. The scene where Banner has a table full of food was great. Also the scene where the Hulk is having it out in the desert and we see two army personnel duck. Not to mention the `he's stole my rocket line' pure fun moments in the heat of battle. Superman The Movie for me is the perfect comic book film, its probably my favourite film of all time and whilst super heroes have been flying onto the big screen recently with an unrelenting ferocity STM is still on that pedestal high in the sky above all those pretenders. The closest are two films I love, Spiderman and the first X-Men. But now Ang Lee and ILM have crafted a film which is so good, its joined STM up there in the `best super hero ever' movies pedestal that adjourns the comic book skyline. Whilst its not better its not far behind at all. Id prefer to see new movies based on The Hulk that's for sure.",,13 July 2003
No sequel - or I'll be angry,"I have seen most of the films of talented, Taiwan-born director Ang Lee and an eclectic mix of genres they represent: following his Mandarin-language 'father knows best' trilogy, we've had English costume drama ""Sense And Sensibility"", middle class family angst work ""The Ice Storm"", American civil war drama ""Ride With The Devil"" and - my favourite - kung fu movie ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Now surprisingly he has turned his hand to comic strip character and the result is a disappointment that one critic dubbed ""grouching tiger, grumpy dragon"".

Lee is obsessed with the father/son relationship, so this is an attempt to re-interpret the 1962 Marvel Comics strip and the 1970s television series into a psychological drama in which the green monster is a personification of Freud's id, while endeavouring to capture the original comic strip format in a series of split-screen episodes. However, sadly it fails on too many levels. The first hour is simply too slow and dull; much of the dialogue is hackneyed or techno-babble; in many of the scenes of conflict, one cannot actually see what is going on and, when one can, it looks silly; above all, this 15-foot, computer-generated, jumping giant is neither life-like nor that frightening.

Eric Bana (""Black Hawk Down""), as scientist Bruce Banner, and Jennifer Connelly (""A Beautiful Mind"", once again loyal partner to someone brilliant but deranged, are capable of better, while Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot - playing the respective fathers - have the kind of gravelly voices that increasingly irritate. Please don't even think of a sequel.",,24 July 2003
Exhilirating and thrilling action when the animated green man is on the screen.,"The Hulk was fantastic when Hulk himself was on the screen. The action is most thrilling, exhilirating and fun. The facial expressions on the animated Hulk are very good.

NOT TO MENTION the ever annoying and pointless split screen sequences. for the love of god, did Ang Lee really need to do that? the only thing that keeps this movie alive is the hulk himself. the animation is great. otherwise like i say, it's a bore fest. 5.0/10",,6 August 2003
PUNY HUMANS SUCK!!!!!!!!,"I've sat back all weekend reading mostly negative reviews about Ang Lee's Hulk and it's really making me angry - ""and you wouldn't like me when I'm angry."" Hulk is the best comic book adaptation to date. Movie audiences are so use to seeing fluff that don't know a great film when they see one. The Hulk is a thinking man's film. If you don't wanna think, if you don't want to get into the origins of the character(s)then I suggest you go see 2Fast2Furious or wait for the next hokey Spiderman to come out. Better yet, go see X2, where characters like Nightcrawler appear out of no where without a concrete explanation of how he was made into the Nightcrawler in the first place. But I digress.

Is the movie a bit long? Yes. Does the CGI look ""real?"" Of course not, it's a 15 foot, 1 ton weighing green monster. How in the world could the Hulk look any more ""real"" than what ILM came up with? If you have the answer then I'm sure you could make tons of money working for ILM yourself. So, get over it people. If you thought you were going to see Spiderman or Superman then you don't know squat about comic books or movies in general. The Hulk is a dark, misunderstood character who wants to left alone. He doesn't just go around smashing sh@#@#! SO LEAVE HIM AND ANG LEE alone! There's so much about the Hulk that HAD to be explained in order to make this movie as believable as possible and I think Ang Lee pulled it off. If you're looking for a hero to save your cat out of a tree, go rent Superman. If you want mindless, senseless action that doesn't move a story forward, then go see Matrix Reloaded. If you want substance, go see the HULK. No other comic book adaptation can hold the Hulks big green NUTSACK!!!!!!

Reactions remind me of 2001: A Space Odyssey,"I've seen the movie once and need to see it again before I can make up my mind. But, I'd have to say that it's a pretty good movie, maybe even an outstanding one.

The reactions that I've read on this board remind me of how critics and audiences alike reacted to 2001: A Space Odyssey. There were also many complaints about how slow the movie was, how disjointed the story was, how emotionless the actors were, and what in the world was that ending all about.

That film is now recognized as one of the best. Hulk, too, is trying to do new things and people will complain. For instance, the split screen and foreground-background exchange techniques is an attempt at a new visual vocabulary. I don't know how long it took audiences to accept the metaphor of ""montages"" and other now-accepted editing techniques, but I think these novel things will soon work themselves into our movie vocabulary.

As someone in the sciences, I have to say that the careful attention to the science behind the hulk characteristics is very impressive.

Thank you Universal,"I wanna thank Universal for taking a risk with their first Marvel franchise, a risk none of the other studios would have taken. They invested well over $100M in a comic book movie that they thought would have some shelf life and created an art film. Unfortunately the film isn't all that it could be but I am glad Universal took the risk so maybe future comic movie can lean from Hulk's strengths and weaknesses and make original and challenging adaptations instead of Daredevil and Catwoman. From what I read online (take this with a pinch of salt) Universal's next superhero flick will be Watchmen directed by Darren Aronofski. I think Terry Gilliam was right when he said the only way to do Watchmen justice is in a 6-12 part mini-series but I'm interested to see what Aronofski does. As for the Hulk sequel I think its safe to change hands because the character has already been established and we can jump into more action, think when Cameron took over Aliens from Ridley Scott, just keep the budget to $80mil or less. We need more people like David Fincher, Ridley Scott, Brian DePalma and Michael Mann making superhero movie people can respect like when Richard Donner made Superman. Hey Universal, hoy about letting your golden boy Stephen Sommers make a superhero flick, just don't give him a blank check like you did with Van Helsing!",,24 May 2004
LAME,"this was one of the sorriest super hero movies i have ever seen.he wasn't trying to stop the bad guys he was getting away from them.so don't expect nothing but pure bordem.it was a wast of time so who was the main bad guy well just find out for yourself.it was just crap,crap,crap,crap,crap,crap,crap,crap,and crap",,29 June 2003
A movie that forgot how to be fun,"I don't have necessarily anything against making a comic book movie deal with the emotional backgrounds and delve into deeper personal issues, but PLEASE, there has to be a limit of some sort. These movies are supposed to be fun, remember? This movie eschews almost all the things that make comic book movies fun, instead choosing to labor on and on about Bruce Banner's complex emotional makeup, all the while forgetting to fully develop the story or create realistic characters. So basically, the movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes of emotional exploration into a bunch of truly boring characters. Characters like Betty and Thunderbolt Ross and the evil military scientist are completely one-dimensional, the general is evil, the evil military scientist is even more evil, and Betty sits there and looks sad. Meanwhile Bruce hardly has a personality at all...did anyone realize this? His character has no development, and omes off as a personality-less wimp who only becomes (slightly) interesting when he turns into the Hulk. And the performances...it's cruel to be hard on actors who have such cardboard characters, but only Jennifer Connelly does a passable job. Nick Nolte is particularly notable for his unbelievably bad ""Denise Richards-like"" performance that had most of the audience laughing. The story gets a pretty tame treatment too. There's simply nothing notable or impressive about it. Nothing surprised me or excited me, it was extremely easy to see where the plot would lead next, except, I may add, the ending, which was so ludicrous that it almost defied explanation. Simple logical flaws really bugged me...why they brought Nick Nolte to talk to his son in the final scene, how a janitor like Nick Nolte could still get access to his son's lab even after it was under military guard, how Hulk can jump thousands of feet in the air, why the scientists wanted a sample of Hulk even though they already knew exactly how he was created and could have easily gotten the formula from his father instead...the list goes on and on. In X-men 2 there weren't any little plot points that disturbed me like this.

But I guess the reason most people on this board give the movie good reviews is because it attempts to be something more, it earnestly tries to analyze and explore the emotional backgrounds of all the characters, but it comes off as incredibly boring and pretentious. How many slow meandering conversations can Betty have with her father? How many times does Bruce have to have the same dream? How many times does Nick Nolte have to go into another deep explanation of his motives? It's simply such a deluge of endless exploration, it's like watching Requiem for a Dream or The Ice Storm or something. When you add that the Hulk looks incredibly bad, there wasn't a single moment where I wasn't painfully aware that he was totally CGI, and that the scenes with Hulk are pretty disappointing...(fighting Hulk dogs and jumping across the desert chased by like two helicopters?) it becomes a really hard movie to like. I really thought the movie would be great because of Ang Lee, but I fear he might have forgotten what kind of movie this is supposed to be. These are comic books for god's sake, it's supposed to be pulpy fun. Xmen2 had the formula right, a plot that surprised and pleased people and tied up loose ends and was fast moving...combined with a lot of action. So what the hell happened to the Hulk? Don't get caught up in the emperor's new clothes phenomenon of most of these reviews. Go see the movie yourself, I'm willing to bet that you'll probably be incredibly disappointed.",,22 June 2003
6.2! ((cough))CRAZY!((cough)),"I am apalled that this movie has recieved a 6.2/10 as a rating. I also find it unbelievable that the highest percentages of votes were 7's and 8's. And if you rated this film as a 10 or 9 I hope you accidentally clicked these stars. I personally think this film should have a rating of 4/10. I came to the drive-in to watch a movie, yes a movie, NOT a powerpoint presentation. Throughout the whole movie every scene changed with a ""checkerbox"" or a ""blinds"" or a ""split."" I don't know why anyone would change scenes with weird little ways like those listed above. Especially after Spiderman, a movie based on a comic book, did just fine without this new scene-changing technique. Furthermore, the movie was unbelievable. I know the Hulk is supposed to ""smash"" everything but when I watch a movie I don't want to see a big green monster jumping long distances and smashing buildings. I want a GOOD PLOT. Yes I said ""GOOD PLOT"" not a cheesy love story and a monster smashing and a fight with evil old dad. So I don't know if all the users who rated this movie highly don't understand the rating system or just have very poor and low standards for movies, once again YES MOVIES, not comic books or slide shows.",,10 November 2003
What's up? This was a good movie?,"I've been reading some of the reviews and I'm starting to realize that no one understands this is a movie!? Not just some pointless comic movie, but a movie based on characters and emotion. I mean what did you want out of this movie? Two hours of HULK SMASH!? Well mabey I'm the only one but I respect that they made some bold moves in this.

1. This movie has a plot! 2. Hulk looks more like a cartoon? Well let's make this movie more like a comic with the transitions and editing. This was great, really gave it that comic feel. 3. The Hulk looked great, unlike most thought. 4. It has good acting.

Let's get this straight to the point, would you like this movie? Well here is the answer. If you want to see a smart made movie instead of HULK SMASH FOR 2 HOURS then you will like this. If not go and watch From Justin To Kelly, might be more along you're lines of entertainment.",,20 June 2003
