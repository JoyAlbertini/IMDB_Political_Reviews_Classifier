A couple of answers that may be useful to understand this film better!!,,9.0,12 February 2008
Freaked me out,"I haven't written a comment on IMDb for about 3 years but was inspired to with this film. It is not very often that I come across a film by accident (World Movies on cable) and the spend the next day scouring the internet to find out information about it and can't get it out of my head! Anyway, yep there are plot holes, but Old boy borrows a lot from surrealism and you are meant to suspend your disbelief! I don't buy comments when people say ""it is so unrealistic because he should've done this ..."" because it is a surrealist film and meant to be unrealistic! For me the sign of a good film is if it sticks on your head! THis one surely does (althought I did have to look away a few times ... ) Loved it!!!! Work of cruel genius!!! (HOLLYWOOD - Please don't ruin it by remaking it!!!)",9.0,29 July 2007
Absolutely Sublime.......................................................,"I've scored this a 9 but I think I may have been a little harsh! I have just read a review that says the reviewer cannot understand the hype. I can see no hype. Everything the film promised and more was delivered. This is a truly wonderful film. It is beautifully acted, brutally and painstakingly directed and as good a display of raw emotion as I have witnessed in any language. The story is gripping, the characters believable and well rounded, the emotion human and the feeling I was left with at the end of the film is one of awe. And that was after I had watched it twice. Honestly, this is a truly, truly wonderful film. Do not miss it under any circumstances!",9.0,2 January 2007
A cinematic bad boy,,10.0,8 September 2016
If only we were all living in Asia....,"To start off; This is the one and only film that kept me quiet for a whole 5 mins after seeing it. I literally couldn't close my mouth, and yet there wasn't any sound coming out of it. Oldboy had such an impact on me that words are too little to describe that impact. Therefore this film is definitely in my top 3 films ever made. It belongs there because it has a massive ingredient that a lot of films seem to miss out on; a divine plot. Even though the acting and screenplay are world class, the plot is really the cherry on the cake.

When it comes to screenplay Park Chan-Wook is unique (at least for western standards) in his way of filming. The colours are so vivid and it seems like he wanted every shot to be a piece of art. One tip: If you like the shooting in 'Oldboy', have a look at 'Sympathy for Lady Vengeance', the third part in Park's revenge-trilogy. It's even superior to the camera-work in 'Oldboy'. Don't, however, expect a story like Oldboy's, because you would be very disappointed.

When it comes to acting and the music, this film is also one of the better films ever made. The music sticks in your head and every time I put in my Oldboy-DVD and the theme-song comes up, I'm just flooded with good memories (even though the plot doesn't have a single reason to be happy about). The characters are also presented very well by the outstanding cast. Especially Choi Min-Sik and Yu Ji-Tae set a very convincing performance.

I really appreciate this film being respected as it should be, by having a place in the top 250. If, however, it was up to me it would be even higher in the ranking. I don't see why films like 'The Usual Suspects' or 'Memento', which are fantastic pieces of film-making and which without a doubt deserve a place in the top 250, are higher in the top 250 than 'Oldboy'. They serve the same cause; a fantastic plot. But those plots can't stand in the shadow or even come close to the plot of 'Oldboy'. The one and only reason is that those two films are better known and from a western production company. If we were all living in Asia, no doubt 'Oldboy' would be in the top 20 of all time.

My advice to people who haven't watched this film yet: Go see it! This is definitely a must- see. If you have a weak stomach, pull yourself together and still watch it. Don't be as shallow as a lot of people here tend to be. Look beyond the violence and see the things I mentioned before: world class acting, cinematography, music and last but certainly not least the plot. Once you've opened yourself up you'll find a whole new world of cinema. Enjoy!",10.0,19 December 2007
You Only Live Once...,"Imagine what you'd do, when you wake from a bad dream, to find you're held by four square walls, for as long as someone deems, no idea why you're trapped, what you've done, why you're kidnapped, just a ceaseless line of dumplings going down your gyoza hatch. Now some fifteen years have passed, every question has been asked, and you're suddenly set free, can start your own avenging spree, before you do you need to feed, by eating something that's in need, so an octopus is ordered, and head first you cross the borders. But things aren't what they might seem, tied and tethered and undreamed, as the puppet master hovers, manipulates what you'll discover.

Some films you cannot watch too often and this is one of the greatest pieces of cinematic brilliance ever created.",10.0,22 January 2022
Excellent in it's sickness,"I looked at program for today and I saw movie ""Oldboy"". I read plot and I liked it. What I expected is decent thriller from very good South Korean cinematography,something like ""Salinui chueok "". But once again I was wrong. ""Oldboy"" is masterpiece, so unusual from all other movies. I've seen lots of violence on screen and to me this isn't nothing new but I think that people under 18 really shouldn't watch this one. It's because movie is brutal and I don't think that younger ones would fully understand this one.

To say something about plot is quite impossible because I don't know where to begin. If I start talking about the movie I could tell few important things and I know that people often read other comments because they didn't watch that movie. So,I'm going to say only what I read before watching this movie.

On his daughter's birthday, Oh Dae-su gets drunk and soon he's arrested by the police. His best friend No Joo-hwan somehow manages to get him out of jail and when No Joo-hwan is making a phone call Oh Dae-su disappears. Someone kidnap's him and puts him into room during 15 long years.But one day he's released.

That's the plot. Very interesting, you should watch this movie and then judge it. By the rating on IMDb this movie is in top 250 movies. Now I can understand why. This plot that I wrote doesn't reveal the greatness of the people who wrote the script. I bow to them because this movie is so good, with all those twists and it really represents a whole new wave of making a movie, of writing a script and of acting in it. About direction and actors I can say only good things. Director Park Chan-wook won prize Grand Jury at Cannes. That's enough about direction part. About actors. I can say that I'm impressed by one actor:Choi Min-sik. He's amazing in major role and he showed great potential. I hope I will see him again in some good movie.

I cannot say anything more because I could reveal some secret and I don't wanna do that to all new viewers. Only a recommendation. Beautiful, intelligent masterpiece of movie that I highly recommend for everyone with strong stomach and too all of you who want to see one excellent, but sick story. 10/10",10.0,22 July 2007
One of most well-made films I've ever seen,"I decided to check this movie out after Ebert's 4 star rave review, and the cult status this movie has received (and was also intrigued by the sexy-looking Ultimate Edition), so I decided to rent it. I was VERY surprised at how different it was than I expected it to be - I expected a ton of violence and not much in the way of writing or acting. The first time I saw it, I wasn't blown away, just kind of like whatever.

When I watched it for the second time, however, I really started to notice how well it's made, in addition to liking it more. Every shot is bursting with background detail, a great amount of attention on the production design (the theme of a certain color in a scene was restrained, yet perfectly balanced). The actors really gave it all, especially the 2 male leads who really blew me away. The music is a varied mix of beautiful classical music and some pretty cool techno. The screenplay is brilliant; the characters are developed very well, extremely complex, and the plot is not only ingenious, but the payoff and twists are 1000x better than any Shamaylan movie.

Simply put, from a technical point of view, it's one of the best movies ever. From a critic's point of view, it is a very well-done movie that goes a little overboard in sex and violence, and is just a little strange.",9.0,21 April 2007
As good and disturbing as expected.,"I read the review for ""Oldboy"" a few years ago and have since read praise about the movie from IMDb posters. Often times movies with that kind of hype tend to fall short and is a major disappointment. I don't know anything about Korean cinema so I had fairly low expectations. I had expected it to be a simplistic revenge film, shot in bad film stock. Well I have to say that I'm glad I was wrong, and even gladder still that I actually watched this film.

The basic story is that a man named Oh Dae-Su is kidnapped and held captive for 18 years and then released. He has no idea who or why this is being done to him. While in captivity he readies himself for the day when he gets out and take revenge on those who imprisoned him, and to find out why he was imprisoned. So far it sounds just like any old revenge martial art flick and up to this point it pretty much is, but it's incredibly well crafted. I have to admit I have not paid much attention to Asian martial arts films since Bruce Lee died and maybe I should now. Mainly because this movie doesn't have the jumpy camera work, or bad editing of those old flicks. This movie is a crisply shot as any Scorcese film. That alone elevates this movie to a higher plateau.

Once he is released, Oh Dae-Su goes on a quest to find what happened to his family and to find the identity of those who had him captured. During the quest for the bad guys, the movie played out like an old fashioned detective movie. The search wasn't rushed and neither was it boring. I suppose the set up made us want to go on this quest with Oh Dae-Su which sounds like Odysseus, and just as Odysseus went on one incredible quest so did Oh Dae-Su.

It's when he finds the man who had him held captive that the movie truly departs from being an average revenge film to something that is extra ordinary and extraordinarily disturbing. It's at this point that I have to say that the less said the better. It's something totally out of the ordinary and something that I think will repulse some viewers, but at the same time one can't help have sympathy for all the characters even the man who ordered Oh's incarceration.

The acting in the movie is excellent. I had no idea that Korean cinema has such skillful actors. They all really played their part incredibly well. Min-sik Choi, who played Oh Dae-Su was incredible. He goes through the rigors of being a desperate captive, to being a determined man on a mission. Along the way he runs through the gamut of so much emotion and not once did he hit a false note.

Overall I have to say that this movie is incredibly well crafted and as good as everybody say, however I find it a little disturbing so I can't give this movie a ten. But don't let my not giving the film a ten scare you away it's a good, enjoyable film.",8.0,3 February 2009

"Pass by the ""Boo"" comments.","After going through the comments, i must say i'm impressed how many people out there don't have a slightest clue of beauty or intelligent screenplays. there are so many comments from people that totally disliked the movie. which is plain and simple not possible, if you got an open mind and a open heart (and are not drunk). I would compare it to chocolate. You may find it too sweet and prefer bitter chocolate. or you like white chocolate more. Or you got diabetes and can only sometimes eat one. But people that totally dislike chocolate scare me to death. Same goes for Oldboy, you gotta admit some of the genius art-form it contains. Its everything in there. Its heartwarming , disgusting, intelligent, beautiful and lead with outstanding performance of any actor . You HAVE to like something, cause it wont get much better. Its chocolate. If you disliked the movie so much and on a constant basis, why even bother to write a comment? My guess is you just could not follow the movie at all. which is my only guess actually. well enough rambling.

:::::::::: Bottom Line :::::::::

If you call common sense, and a human heart your own and like ""challenging"" movies, go and see it NOW.(i recommend the original korean version with subs)I also recommend the pre- and sequel to this movie. (just browse Chan Wook Park) If you think ""The Fast and the Furious"" is the best movie ever made, please do not even bother to watch Oldboy, and spare others your ""brilliant"" reviews.",10.0,6 September 2007
Average revenge film with an extremely weak payoff,"After reading praise after praise about this film on the internet from mostly western viewers (such as the completely clueless Tarantino) and seeing as how it won a major prize at the most recent Cannes Film Festival, my expectations were naturally high when I finally got around to viewing it.

I'm sorry to say that I do not share in their optimistic appraisal of this movie.

After being imprisoned for 15 years for unknown reasons by an unknown person/persons, Daesu (Min-sik Choi) is naturally a bit upset and is dying to figure out who imprisoned him and why. Borrowing a page from M. Night Shyamalan's guide to movie surprises, writer/director Chan-wook Park (along with 3 other writers) attempts to craft a whodunnit that will keep you guessing and interested until the very end. Well, they only half succeed. I'll admit that I'm normally slow when it comes to movie surprises, but this one jumps out at you as soon as Daesu gets out of prison. It couldn't be more obvious unless the director was sitting next to you whispering it into your ear. From that point on, the movie really begins to drag as we watch Daesu meander from one place to the next in an unfocused attempt to find his enemy and discover the reason behind his imprisonment. Perhaps the main problem with the film is the severe lack of information given to both Daesu and the viewer. Rather than finding out the real truth on his own, he is essentially told everything in the end thanks to a well choreographed monologue. This is not a ""detective""-style story that gives you clues along the way. Some secrets and identities are revealed much too early, leaving only the unknown reason for Daesu's imprisonment the movie's last remaining attempt to keep the viewer interested. When we finally learn of the reason, it's a total letdown and should leave any experienced movie watcher either scratching their heads in total disbelief that someone actually considered this as a basis for a film or make you angry enough to stop the movie right then and there. With the movie's undeniably gritty sense of style and beautiful classical score, this should have been mind blowing. But it's not. It's pathetic. It's obvious the filmmakers really didn't know how to craft a film of this caliber, so they fall back on the ""H"" word (you'll catch the ""H"" word when you hear it in the film) to solve ALL of their screen writing problems.

Thankfully the movie does have some positive aspects. The lighting and color scheme really reflect the inner conflicts within Daesu. This is a dark film, and it shows. The cinematography is inventive and vibrant with clever scene transitions and unique movements. The aforementioned score couldn't be better. It's a great mix of classical pieces, original music inspired by classical pieces, and moments of pseudo techno/industrial music, and it certainly does a great job of infusing the viewer with a sense of doubt and depression. Min-sik Choi gives an extremely admirable performance as the mentally conflicted Daesu and handles all kinds of scenes from action to romance with a great sense of confusion and surprise. Finally the relationship between Daesu and the mysterious Mido (Hye-jeong Kang) is really quite touching, allowing for some nice dramatic moments.

That being said, it's ashame that the film's story couldn't match its style.

Chan-wook Park has directed some of Korea's best and most memorable films in recent memory, such as JSA and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, but Old Boy is simply a semi-interesting film. In the realm of revenge flicks, this is perhaps one of the more ambitious (which is definitely a good quality) films out there, but ambition can only get you so far, and Chan-wook Park just can't pull it off. Worth a look for film fans, but it's just not remarkable enough to be recognized on a global scale. Beware before you buy, for you could end up being sorely disappointed as well. 6/10",7.0,30 September 2004

Great film!,"I feel compelled to defend this film from some quite frankly unwarranted criticism. Although it isn't without its flaws, and all films have a few,it certainly isn't a one star film.What this film has is the ability to be sublime, shocking, ridiculous, mildly amusing and visually stunning which is some feat for any film.The sheer scale of the comments here suggests that here is a film that gets to you in one way or another. This film is as far away from Maborosi as you can get yet both films are up there as great pieces of cinema. I wont divulge the plot or end this comment with a Latin quote to reinforce my self importance i'll just say go and watch it, preferably if you're not too squeamish and don't mind subtitles.This film left me thinking about it the following day which is normally a good thing (atleast it shows my memory is working!)",9.0,17 March 2007
One step ahead of America,"Oldboy takes a hammer and ""batters"" its American equivalents, leaving them as pulped as a chewed up squid. Park Chan Wook displays what America misses with his ultra-stylish, ultra-violent thriller. Why watch Ben Affleck fail spectacularly to summon any displayable talent, when Min sik Choi serves up a memorable role as the disturbed, vengeful Dae Su Oh, in the second of the Vengeance trilogy. Park skillfully creates a compelling plot that will have you guessing through the entire film, up until the final shocking revelation. The Cinematography expertly done by Jeong-hun Jeong, who also worked on the follow up to this film, Chinjeolhan geumjassi. Everything about this film is done in style and panache and creates a memorable experience, and has many memorable scenes.

Many people accuse this film of being ""unrealistic"". These people forget that this a film, not a documentary. No one complains About Star Wars being unrealistic, and rightly so. Films have a right to stretch out reality, don't forget the reason it does this is to be entertaining.

Although the film has strong violence of a graphic nature, I advise you to watch it, if only to broaden your perspectives of world and Asian cinema.",9.0,7 March 2007
Amazing Movie,"Yes this is a twisted movie with plots that unravel slowly and sometimes there are scenes that are slow. But over all it's incredible. Some of the symbolism behind the scenes are stunning. You have to go deep to appreciate it. There is a lot of gore and violence that can turn you off, but I was simply amazed by the depth and width of some of the scenes.

Without giving anything away, once the main character is released he meets a man with a dog. It's seems to be an irrelevant scene, but put yourself in a cage for 15 years and think about how you would act? What happens to that man? Isn't he also in a cage? Aren't we all? What is the symbolism of that man? How about the dog? Revenge to the main character in this movie is his life. Why? And you don't question it because you know what happened to him. He doesn't question it either.

To me this was one of the greatest depictions of Oedipus or other Greek characters I've seen this decade in a movie. Nothing is new. If you liked ""Requiem for a Dream"" or ""Blue Velvet."" Consider this one.",10.0,29 August 2007
A masterpiece for the cinema fanatics.,"The first time I watched ""Old-boy"", I was half-amazed, half-disgusted. I wasn't quite sure how to rate the movie in general. I knew 2 things: 1. From a visual point of view, it's one of the best movies I have ever seen. Cinematography & scenography are nothing short of perfection. 2. I had problems with the plot, some holes in it, and a general feeling of injustice, as crime seemed to be pretty lightweight compared with the punishment.

2nd time was a weird situation. A girl I knew tried to get into the film school, and the day before her exam she asked me to supply her with some movies that were interesting visually. 2 films we watched were ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""Old-boy"", and, especially the 2nd 1 was a revelation.

Knowing the plot, it was easy for me to concentrate on the visual side, and my friend always consumes the movies this way. Results of paying attention to the tiniest of details were stunning. I don't think there's 1 scene in there shot without an idea, without something happening in the background, or without an image responding to the theme of the scene.

Don't be a baby crying about violence - camera turns away in key moments. Don't be a smartarse, picking on the shortcomings of the plot - think about Hitchcock or Chaplin and how they gave a flying f... about plot. Appreciate the work of the whole crew, and for best effects watch it a couple of times. It's worth it.",9.0,19 February 2008
Korea's great gift to movie industry,"I don't know why but this movie will always be my favorite. Maybe because of amazing screenplays, very emotional soundtracks or feeling the high tension in every second. I watched so many movies which includes fight scenes. Some of them were good and some of them were bad but in Oldboy... I guess the best describing word is '' real'' about that fight scenes. Because I felt they were. And that scenes are covering about only 2% of the whole movie. Cinemography, perfect harmony of music and scenes, an amazing story and one of the great plot twists in movie history. I am struggling to find the correct words for this movie because this is a movie not a book. And I may easily say it is a masterpiece... I enjoyed the movie with every second of it.

Ugh.,"I saw Old Boy on a grey market DVD about half a year ago and fell asleep during the first twenty minutes. Since then, my friends have literally been begging me to see it to the end, so this Saturday I watched it on the big screen where I had no chance of escape.

Boy was that a mistake. Old Boy is by turns idiotic, horrendous and senselessly violent. It lacks the glee of the most basic revenge film. Even Kill Squad did it better.

Old Boy simply has no point to speak of. My question is: How did the director and scriptwriter screw up a revenge thriller?

Old Boy is very reminiscent of Takashi Miike's far superior Ichi the Killer. The difference between Ichi and Old Boy is one of extremes. Both films revolve around extracting brutal revenge. In this film, the eponymous hero seeks vengeance for fifteen years of imprisonment in a hotel room. In Ichi, Kakihari, a Yakuza enforcer, must track down his kidnapped Boss who may or may not be dead. Both Kakihari and Old Boy use torture to achieve their ends, but in Ichi the violence is committed by such dedicated sadists that it transcends itself and becomes Dionysian. Thusly, Ichi is far more violent than Old Boy, but far more aware. In Old Boy, the violence does nothing but communicate itself as alternately grotesque and depressing.

The end of this film is so unbelievable that it made me wonder why they didn't just let a seven year old rewrite it. It was that bad. If you thought the end of Ichi was head-scratching, wait until you see this one. You will feel so betrayed by Old Boy's cop-out you may never want to see another South Korean film again.

I think the ridiculous praise this film received (Ebert and Tarantino included) happened because NO ONE was comfortable recommending Ichi. Additionally, Ichi was not distributed theatrically in Ontario (Where I live) and was for a period, even banned.

Ichi is a more violent, more difficult film, but it's rewards are far greater than this misdirected piece of trash. How this film ended up at Cannes is beyond me. I think it was because of the reputation of Park Chan's much better ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"".

Most likely, nothing I'm going to write here is going to prevent the curious from seeing this film. But if you feel like your time was wasted, don't tell me I didn't warn you.",6.0,2 August 2005

More people need to see this film!,"In an age of American cinema where our biggest blockbusters are based on films already successful overseas, this is one movie that needs to be seen by more American movie goers. This is the movie that got me hooked on Asian revenge films. Oldboy is an original movie that shows what happens when a man's freedom is taken away and he doesn't know why, or by whom. He is sudden thrust back into society where he must track down the person that took away his freedom. Along the way come multiple plot twist and surprises that you just don't see coming.

It's a shame so many American film goers refuse to see foreign films, because this movie is genius. Who knows, maybe someday the movie will get remade for audiences here in the U.S. and the main character will be played by Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis. If you want to stay true to the Asian vision, I even think Jackie Chan could be a candidate.",10.0,15 August 2007
"Emotional, evocative and excellent.","Old Boy is my favourite film. As far as I can see, no amount of superlatives could explain quite how much I love it. After my first viewing, (all on my lonesome) I realised I probably hadn't blinked during its entirety and I could quite possibly have been burgled during its course and been none the wiser, such was the extent to which I found it totally and utterly engrossing. Obviously a review consisting of very little other than me spewing praise would be a fairly dull read which was why I never bothered to review Old Boy until after my second viewing, with my Po'. My father being the eternal sceptic that he is turned out to be an extremely worthy person to watch the film with, and his response to it opened my eyes a little as to why I love it that much.

The plot itself is as follows. The protagonist Oh Dae-Su is one day captured and finds himself locked up in a makeshift prison. After a brief spell of anger and spewing hatred for his captors, he resigns himself to his fate, and after 15 years of shadow boxing and suicide attempts he wakes up from a gas induced coma on top of a tower block where he was initially seized. He then proceeds to try and find out who did this and why, and the film basically charts this quest.

The first word that springs to mind when thinking about this film has to be graphic. There are certain scenes which will make those of nervous disposition recoil until they are firmly wedged between the back and seat of their sofa, and they are likely to spend much of the film there as violence is frequent. In most of the extreme cases it is simply the implication of violence and the viewer's imagination when left to its own devices like this will cause its own disgust. This hurdle was a huge thing problem for my dad, who considered some of the violence to be gratuitous, which I can somewhat agree with, although certain scenes are completely integral to the plot. The best way I can justify these scenes is simple. It is all about sending a message, and these do just that. If you can cope with this then you will break down the initial barrier the film leaves lying in the way of your enjoyment.

Another barrier will be the massive culture shock experienced when viewing the film. This is a Korean language film adapted from a Japanese animé series, so there are obviously large cultural differences to the western world. Some of the images used will require quite some thought to fully understand, and the script on translation does lose some of its flow, as any animé or graphic novel fans will associate with. For my father, this made it hard for him to settle into the flow of the film, and I can identify with this slightly from my early days of watching animé.

Many of the themes you will pick up on and the method of direction is very synonymous with Quentin Tarantino. There are devices used in this film which have obviously taken inspiration from Tarantino's works, in particular the Pulp Fiction- esquire use of camera angles, and the famous dotted line sequence. However, Tarantino is himself a huge fan of Old Boy, being its main advocate to win the 2003 Palme d'Or (where it eventually lost out to Fahrenheit 9/11) and has stated Park Chan-Wook as an influence for his directing style on the Kill Bill series, as well as on his later grindhouse works Death Proof and Planet Terror. Chan-Wook takes on a policy of ""trust the director"", and leaves many questions throughout the film which gives it a somewhat disorientating feel at times. This method of directing can seem quite inaccessible, however all loose ends are tied up very satisfactorily in the enthralling and shocking climax. This is an ending to rival the classic Kaiser Sozé twist in the tail of The Usual Suspects.

What really separated and elevates Chan-Wook's work above and beyond Tarantino's however is very simple. Much of Tarantino's work is undertaken as an exercise in direction and film making, and therefore his work can therefore feel shallow. Old Boy however is a film which assesses the deepest corners of the human heart. The middle of three films which make up Chan-Wook's Vengeance Trilogy it is undoubtedly the masterpiece, with a more powerful message than Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. This film has power because of the depths to which it explores the flaws and forces the human heart possesses, stronger and more destructive than any wisdom can overcome. The performances of the main cast and most importantly the director to send this message to the viewer leave this film as about as close to perfection as I can see any film getting.",10.0,27 July 2009

Probably the best Korean movie ever made,"From the ""Vengeance"" trilogy by Pak Chan-wook, Oldboy is probably the best, followed by Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. Simple story, ""low budget"" and actors you already know from Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Although I am a fan of Korean movies, when I've heard about this movie and it's plot for the first time, I thought ""oh my god, another sponsored-by-tomato-factory movie"". I watched it for the first time two years after it was released. And to be honest, I was surprised. Since then, I watched this movie more than ten times and I still find it interesting. To me, Oldboy the best Korean movie ever made. Maybe best Asian movie in the last 20 years.

I recommend you to watch this, along with Sympathy for Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. You'll be also surprised to find the same actors.

This movie changed my life!,"I know my title might sound a little dramatic but it is true. This was one of the first Korean movie's I had ever seen and after that I was hooked. The story is original and beautifully shot. I never understand why people write a synopsis in a review. You can watch the trailer or read what IMDB already has under description. Moving along the movie is great. Good story, drama, fights, and twists. It's on Netflix so catch it while you still can. Stay away from the atrocious American remake.

Compelling yet disturbing film used as a scapegoat by media,"If you look at the awards this title has won, you will see that critics worldwide rated the film very highly when it came out. The story is one that has already been remade by the Americans - a man is imprisoned for 15 years by someone he has never seen, released - given a cellphone and five days to find out why he was imprisoned and identify his captor. Harrowing, excellent acting with the true horror not coming from guns but from a shocking personal realisation at the end of the film. Sadly, as is always the case after a mass murder, the media and the public are looking for an easy solution as to why Cho Seung-Hui murdered American students on a rampage. He was pictured in poses which the press tagged as those struck in OLDBOY but these are used by any soldier, terrorist or nutter.

Overrated!!!,"This film is not bad, but does it deserve to be rated as one of the best films of all times? I think not. When rating a film the most important thing should be, what is the film giving the audience and what is the message that the director is pushing across. In this film the message is not much smarter than your average horror flick, and the only feeling you have after seeing it is disgust. That's not really a bad thing, if it has direction. In films like Seven there is and it can be summed up really easy in the last sentences from Morgan Freeman. ""The world is a beautiful place and worth fighting for. I agree with the last part."" Because Oldboy lacks a message like this the whole film becomes an empty vessel.

That being say, it might be one of the best empty vessels created. The photography is stunning, the editing is clever and the acting is at most parts really good. The story is smart, but becomes a little to smart at times. It's trying too much to live up to films like Memento, Seven or even The Sixth Sense where everything is revealed in the end. First of all I wasn't that surprised, but the worst part was that I really didn't care.

To sum it up: good film, but not even close of being one of the 1000 best films in history.",6.0,20 June 2005

"Not THAT good, not THAT bad either","I feel people somehow invariably overreact when it comes to this movie. Come on guys, it's just a movie, like it or leave it. It's not necessarily a 10 but neither does it deserve a 1. (For what it's worth, I gave it a 7.) How would I explain this split opinion? It depends very much on what one expects from it, as well as on the overreaction of some viewers who feel, perhaps rightly so, that the movie is way overrated on IMDb, so they feel like they have to overreact the other way, giving it a 1, while this movie is most certainly deserving of much more than 1 !

What would be my unadulterated view on the movie itself? It's not as bad as some posters write. At least one should acknowledge some very good camera-work and naturalist honesty in projecting a certain darkness that resides at the bottom of human souls. The main actor does a good job in most of the movie, I think, but the script gives him no chance but to overdo things toward the end, in hysterical tones which can easily grate on the educated movie lover's nerves.

On the other hand, I cannot understand for the life of me how such a movie made it so high on the IMDb rating system. It's really unbelievable how that could happen. Some viewers all over the world liked the movie but that still does not explain it. Perhaps the pride of some viewers couched in the same culture made them vote en masse with automatic 10's? Hard to tell.

Back to the movie now. I would say that within its own rather cheap genre (""B"" movie), Oldboy is an exceptional production, more attentively scripted, shot and acted than most. There is occasionally some really memorable touch in there, the trace of the hand of a professional (even if you may find the general tone of the movie gross and overboard). On the other hand, compared with most other movies that share comparable ratings, Oldboy seems to be woefully lacking in both substantial and stylistic qualities that would qualify it for such an unlikely honor. There are literally hundreds of 7 to 8 rated movies which are undoubtedly better than this one.

If you enjoy this type of ""B"" (from bloody but not only (-:) revenge movie _anyway_ (the ""country relative"" of the ""film noir"" genre), Oldboy will probably not disappoint you. If you expect to watch some kind of unqualified masterpiece, and you have the cinematic culture to understand what that really means, you might (and, I repeat, might) ask for your money back in anger. I have no way of knowing that for sure.",7.0,2 March 2005
The sad spectacle of a sick mind,"Why is everyone ignoring the most obvious this film is strange to most people? Why do we all feel ill at ease with this foreign movie? Well exactly because of that. Because it is a foreign movie made in a cultural mindset that is alien to most of the world. It is a Korean movie made by a Korean director for a Korean public. As as such, much is lost in translation. incest between brother and sister, between a father and his daughter are the subject and are not only consumed on screen they are in a way condoned by the director who views them as to love stories that deserve to be let to blossom. The plot holes and inconsistencies that defy common sense are too many to even bother listing and my in themselves be enough to make the movie risible but you also have to add to them the numerous sadistic as well as masochistic scenes that leave you with a sense general malaise. Not a single character in this movie has an interesting arc or motivations that make sense and the revenge plot quickly appears to be a weak pretext. Although well photographed and scored, this movie is disgusting and evil at its core and one feels dirty after watching it. Don't let anyone fool you with a supposedly artistic nihilist approach. This movie is simple the brain child of a disturbed man with access to a camera and unlike true artists there is nothing poetic about his vision, only the sad twisted spectacle of a disturbed mind.",5.0,12 April 2020

OLDBOY. Pure Cinema,"Oldboy is the kind of film that the cinema was invented for. It doesn't patronise or insult it's audience, it keeps the audience on their toes, constantly engaged in suspense, drama and mystery. Watching this film is an emotional roller-coaster. The cinematography is dark, yet breathtaking, the music accompanies all of the drama and action beautiful, in an almost operatic sense. It's graphically violent, but not gratuitously so, the acting is first rate and the plot is intricate, intelligent, filled to the brim with many philosophical and human ideas.

It's perfect for multiple viewings, it's a good laugh to watch with your mates, it was desired for the really big screen and the experience of watching OldBoy is unforgettable, right up until the very end. Genre defining, it is Kafka-esquire, it's Hitchcockian, Polaski-esquire and plays out like a modern day Dumas novel, all in one. FIRST RATE. loved it, it is a film that can be classified as just pure cinema.",10.0,22 July 2009
Absolutely authentic and 100% bad ass.,"The first time I saw ""Oldboy"" I watched it by myself on a rainy evening. When the credits rolled at the end I think I actually stood up and clapped. It's been a long time since I've seen something so original. The film is gripping, it grabs and never lets you go.

It starts out with a man who is locked inside this room and doesn't know why and blah blah blah...sounds almost cliché. Read the back of the DVD case for a summary. The last fifteen minutes of ""Oldboy"" are the most intense fifteen minutes I've seen in any movie. By the end, you are so eager to know what happened to this poor guy and why he has been punished. And the film takes a twist that makes every hair on your arms stand up and it remains satisfying. It's not one of those twists that leaves you scratching your head. It makes sense! A film like ""Oldboy"" is humbling in that it makes you realize that America is no longer turning out the most cutting-edge stuff. But it's also nice to know that someone out there still has the guts to do a film with no barriers that makes you stand up and flip off guys like Tarantino and go, 'that's what I'm talking about.'

I don't get it.,"Nothing about this film rang true. I've enjoyed a lot of Asian cinema, but perhaps I have just no understanding of the Korean culture. Little that the characters did during the entire film made much sense. There were some wonderful individual scenes and great camera-work, but that didn't make up for a lot of things in the film that appeared for lack of a better word ""lame"". An example is when Oldboy holds off a gang of thugs with a hammer. It didn't work as ""comic book"" action nor as a realistic fight. Another example is the ant thing. Especially the giant ant on the subway. ""Hey, this would look arty"" Really disagree with those that loved this film. It has its merits. I wasn't fooled by the ending twist.

I, however, think it is a masterpiece. The levels of engagement that the actors are in to create the story is brilliant. People are simply overlooking the fact that incest is a huge tragic flaw. there are brilliant, slightly surreal moments, and I think this is what makes the film.

The camera work is something creative, and has moments of paying homage to the comic, and other films.

One of my favorite movies,"This was the movie that got me into Korean cinema. This was in my opinion the best movie from Park-Chan Woo's ""Vengeance Trilogy"" and quite possibly one of the best movies ever made. Around 7 years ago, I have been a huge fan of extreme cinema and I heard about Oldboy from one of my friends. When I actually sat down to watch it, I was completely blown away. This was not like any movie I have ever seen before. The storyline, cinematography, acting and soundtrack have exceeded far beyond my expectations.

The story follows a man named Oh Dae-su, who has been held captive in a cell of what seems to be a hotel room for 15 years. After being released, he tries to find his captor, find out his motives, and achieve ultimate vengeance.

The storyline seems simple enough, but the movie blows up in the faces of the audience with all kinds of unexpected plot twists. Not only that, but the story involves the audience with the characters in the movie by including very good character development and acting.

I could go on and on about this film, but the fact is that it's terrific and worth checking out. It will leave many with lots to talk about after finishing it.",10.0,20 October 2015
A Sick Master Piece.,"Oldboy is what you can call a sick master piece of the south Koreans. The Film is very well plotted and the direction is excellent. This is one of the films that should never be allowed by Hollywood,Bollywood to remake. It is an original.

This is Asian cinema at its best.In the realm of revenge thrillers, you'd be hard pressed to find more ultra-violent vengeance and psycho thrills than in the creepy story of Oldboy.

Park Chan-Wook's Masterpiece,"At first I used to be have this personal negative sentiment about Korean movie. Korean people tends to make everything over-dramatic (my experience watching FLU which is so painful to watch). And then the sentiment is slightly lowered when I finished this movie.

Briefly, this is a story about a man who has been kidnapped and imprisoned for almost 15 years without any explanation. Suddenly he is released only to find note given by the kidnapper which asking him to find the answer who he/she is, why the reason he was imprisoned and get revenge.

A journey to find the answer is begin.

Right from the opening scene until the very last scene, there are no room for me to breath. The cinematography is so stylish and the acting was top-notch performance. The story development is well-thought and the twist is brilliant, relentless and merciless. The last 15 minutes is my favorite part in this movie. It satisfies my curiousness. By the end credit rolls you will find yourself speechless by how disturbing yet gorgeous the movie was and how the director intentionally leaving us some unanswered questions.

My only concern is that I find some of the last part a bit too cliché and sentimental for my taste but it doesn't material.

This is Park Chan-Wook's masterpiece and one of the best Korean movie ever made. You will find many elements like gore, thriller, drama, action blends into one perfectly mixed element.

And just like any other revenge themed movie, the same question will arise:

This is a very disturbing film at times and I probably cringed enough for my liking. I'd have to say that its strongest points were the acting and the script. Every character was utterly believable. Especially the main character, Oh Deseau. I have rarely sympathized for a character in a movie as much as I did for him. 15 years? That's ridiculous. As far as the script goes...wow. It's probably one of the best scripts ever written in the history of film. And the ending is just too much.

The key premise is original, which is rare enough by itself, and when you add to that some good writing you get a great film.

There are some deliberately hammed up comic moments to lighten the mostly very dark mood of the film and these are genuinely very funny.

The action is often over the top, but not in a gory way, and it is interesting to watch the story unfold with the viewer having no more idea of what is happening and why than the protagonist.

The pace is quick enough that you never get bored and the ending is dark and nasty and twisted and surprising.

This movie is incredible.,"Oldeuboi is currently, and has been for a while now, my favorite movie. Min-sik Choi plays his role flawlessly. This movie promises you an exciting experience right off the bat, and then entirely over-delivers and becomes something much more than you expected going into it.

You name it, this movie does it incredibly well. The cinematography is nothing short of artistic. The soundtrack is perfectly fitting and very emotional. The writing and storytelling are the best I've ever seen, and call back to classic tragedies and the tragic hero. I find that American audiences generally don't like this movie much because of it's nontraditional storytelling and ending. If you're interested in something you won't ever get out of an American movie, this will deliver. And don't worry about being bored, because not a second of the runtime of this movie is wasted. There is always either action happening on screen, plot being developed, or cinematography being shown off. Most of the time all at once. Even if you don't like drama, or don't like international movies, it can be appreciated for so many different things that everyone will find something to love about it. The fight scenes in this movie are some of the best I've ever seen, and aren't even one of the main reasons why I love this movie. If you aren't very open to stories that are nontraditional or something you're not used to seeing in the West, you might take issue with this movie, to which I'd say you need to open up some more, because you're missing out on a great experience.

As I said earlier, Min-sik Choi is an incredible actor, and after watching Oldeuboi I watched two of his other films, ""I Saw the Devil"" and ""Nameless Gangster: Rules of the Time"", both of which are incredible films that I suggest you go watch if you liked Oldeuboi or are interested in Korean cinema but want something other than Oldeuboi. Min-sik Choi delivers an almost, but not quite as amazing performance in both of those movies. Oldeuboi itself is a great dive into Korean cinema and what it has to offer.

Don't Be Deceived By The Good Reviews,"I would say that although this film does have its good moments, its not as good as many say it is. First half of the film is pretty intriguing and mysterious. You can't help but wonder what you would do in the situation of a man who has been locked up in a room for unknown to him reasons for fifteen years.

The film goes downhill after Oh Dae Su gets out of the prison and starts seeking revenge. The plot has been made way more complicated than it had to be. What I found most annoying is various sentimental scenes where a piano is playing and we supposedly get to see someone's emotions or their ""softer side"" . I did not like it because I thought it took away from the continuity of the movie and its straightforwardness.

When I said the plot is too complicated I meant not only that but also that its a very unrealistic plot in which characters do not act the way, I think, people would act in real life. Its just dumb sometimes.

There is also a pretty tasteless sex scene that is just painful to look at.

"It's hard. Very hard to watch, but it doesn't make it any less interesting.","How often do you see a movie that makes you think, ""What did I see? I don't know, but it's genius"". That's exactly what you think after watching ""Oldboy"", 2003, directed by Park Chang Wook. Very mixed feelings of disgust and delight overtake the viewer as soon as he reveals the final twist of the plot.

In a nutshell, the plot tells the story of an ordinary businessman, Oh Dae-su, who unexpectedly disappears for 15 years. And where he was and who stole him is to be found out over the course of the film.

""Oldboy"" comes across exactly as a psychological drama, pushing the feelings and raising reasonable philosophical questions.

The main character does not show emotion on his face, but there is so much pain in his eyes, thanks to the acting of Choi Min-sik. The viewer feels sorry for Oh Dae-su and wants to empathize with him, but judging his behavior soberly, it's the opposite. The antagonist Lee Woo Jin played by Yoo Ji Tae also proves to be more than just a faceless villain, the viewer finds out how smart he is and how justified his actions are. So well-reasoned, in fact, that you don't realize whose side you're on.

The main problem with the movie is the cast. Other than Oh Dae-su and Lee Woo Jin, the characters are not memorable, seeming faceless. After watching it, it's hard to remember a single minor character who was interesting.

The film raises questions about the viewer's personal life stance. What is love? Platonically, relationally, sexually? Is there a difference? What does it mean to get revenge? At what point does revenge end? And what is the difference between a man and an animal?

You won't find the answers to these questions in the film, but it will make you think for a long time, the hyperbolized details of the scenes, the close-ups, the cruelty. All of this can be justified by the desire to create an atmosphere of discomfort, because it's the only way you can feel at least a little bit of what Oh Dae-su felt.

It's hard. Very hard to watch, but it doesn't make it any less interesting. Separately, I would like to highlight the camerawork. A lot of angles, camera moves, theatrical scenes, and a lot more. All of these visuals serve their purpose. The fight scene in the hallway is considered iconic for a reason. The entire fight is worked out to the smallest detail.",10.0,10 September 2022

One of the most incredible performances ever by Choi (the acting all around is spectacular, but he stands out above the rest), great directing, the corridor scene is just pure glee, one of the most ingenious plots and story line twists of all time, and believe it or not, the movie is extremely funny in some parts (the whole, ""now let me tell you my story"" part is hilarious, just to name one example). However what really shows the quality of OldBoy is that it's not just a excellent conglomerate of all those things that make a movie good, it was how it affected you. OldBoy is a extremely deep and psychological movie on the level as well as the carnal level, and it gets better every time you see it. If you think you can handle the content, and don't mind subtitles, then this film is a absolute must see. Overall, this is quite possibly the best revenge drama of all time.",10.0,26 February 2007
"Park Chan-Wook's Masterful ""Oldboy"" is a Tour-De-Force of storytelling! My favorite film of all time!","I just recently noticed that I have written 99 reviews on IMDb since joining in 2005. And I have decided, in honor of my 100th review, to tackle my favorite film- a Korean release from 2003, directed by the masterful Park Chan-Wook. I am speaking of course, of the controversial and amazingly elegant film ""Oldboy.""

Based loosely upon a Japanese Manga, Chan-Wook's ""Oldboy"" stars the amazing Choi Min-Sik as Oh Dae-Su, a drunk businessman in Korea. The film opens with his abduction from public, as he is mysteriously placed in a dark, dingy building, where criminals pay to have people held captive. Dae-Su is locked in the hotel-like room, being fed daily and only having a TV to keep him company, for 15 years. One day he learns on a news report that his wife was found murdered, and he later learns that his young daughter was sent to adoptive parents out of the country. Over time, he becomes depressed, angry, and eventually empty. He begins to train himself to fight, plotting to escape and seek vengeance. Then, all of the sudden, he awakens one day to find that he has been set free... given money, a suit and a cellphone. A taunting phone call from the one who ordered his captivity ensures that Dae-Su will stop at nothing to get his revenge.

He is joined by Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jeong), a beautiful and feisty young chef and his old friend No Joo-hwan (Ji Dae-Han), whom try to assist him as he solves the mysteries surround why he was imprisoned. He also does eventually encounter the man who ordered his capture- a wealthy businessman who lives in a towering skyscraper named Lee Woo-jin (played by Yoo Ji-tae), though the encounter only raises the stakes- Dae-su cannot kill him, for he will kill himself first to rob Dae-su of his revenge if he tries... And now, Dae-su only has five days to solve the mystery, or else Woo-jin will kill Mi-do, whom Dae-su has began to fall for.

The acting is superb, especially from our leads Choi Min-sik and Yoo Ji-tae. Both deliver astounding and detailed performances. Choi Min-sik is sympathetic yet at the same time frightening and unstable... you will root for him while fearing him. And Yoo Ji-tae is incredible as our villain, who is oddly likable and charming despite his cruel and often evil nature, much in the same way Hannibal Lector was in ""Silence of the Lambs"", and he plays the role with much joy and delight. Both were chilling.

Supporting roles were all well-played. Kang Hye-jeong and Ji Dae-han were both phenomenal, and all other secondary characters were well-played. (Particularly funny is Oh Dal-su as ""Mr. Park"", the nasty little jerk who runs the building where Dae-su was imprisoned. He's the sort of guy who would double-cross his mother for a nickle, and he's a lot of fun to watch.)

Park Chan-Wooks direction is what really, truly elevates this film to unknown bounds, though. Chan-Wook has a poetry and a distinctive, sharp visual sense to his camera-work. Everything is perfectly deliberate and perfectly fine-tuned. His choice of colors, textures and patterns also set a marvelous mood. This is one of those films where even if muted, the visual tell the story just as much as the dialog. Everything is perfectly planned out- right down to the wallpaper on the walls and the tiniest prop. (It's even in the making-of.) Chan-Wook's visual sensibility and ability to communicate his ideas with the actors is the closest to perfection as is obtainable. He is truly a master of film.

The script is very tight, dare I say, even flawless. It all fits together like an enormous jigsaw puzzle, and each piece is important. The few action sequences are amazing and gritty, the music is perfectly implemented to compliment the story. The many twists and turns the plot takes are breathtaking, and you will leave this film feeling touched and disturbed. It gets under your skin and infects you. You will not forget this movie!

This is truly an amazing film. I usually try to find something negative to mention in each of my reviews, but here... I just can't.

""Oldboy"" is a 10 out of 10. It is as close to perfection as a film can get.",10.0,17 February 2012
Speechless,"I watched it 5 years ago. It was one of my first movies. No exp at cinema at all, but still after five years, after great evolution of me, it is still flawless and brilliant. Originally i watched this on the edge, right before i changed my whole perception on the world, people and phenomena, right before destruction of everything that i've ever known and believed, before falling into the abyss and being lost inside of my head.

The world laughs with you,"A classic Korean revenge film developed by the mastermind Chan-wook Park couldn't be any better then what it has become. The movie itself has attributed a rather love it or hate it personality during its introduction to the American public and its rather explicit and disturbing scene for sex. I entirely understand its concept and brutality; it is after all a great homage to film-noir and attempts to break every boundary to become one of the darkest films ever created without being a actual horror.

During the 15 year imprisonment scene the character had lost all possible nature of himself as he had been forced to become a animal. Masterbating to dancing women. Writing in his journal on whom would have put him through all this pain. Training in combat by punching the wall. Slowly cutting through the brick to at least just feel the breeze of the outside and the rain trickle over his hand and even attempting to smash his head against glass in attempt to kill himself.

All that was once the character had been lost in a spiral of insanity in his solitary confinement. Upon release his character had to regain the ability to live in society. He had to learn new words, he had to learn to laugh, to love, to feel guilt and sorrow and to cry. All this character development to a beautiful soundtrack mixed with classical and techno themes.

Only flaw in this movie would have to be the one scene when Oh Dae-su takes the roll of super-man and cleanses the underground of all the scum. That wasn't enough to interrupt the brilliance of the movie. The time he was lying on the ground with a grin on his face before he put the cigarette in his mouth or the time hes walking away laughing after the man has fallen from the roof onto a car.

In end this movie will not make you laugh. No it will make you cry on behalf of how we lost the film industry to Korea. Because remember when you laugh, the world laughs with you but when you cry, you cry alone.",6.0,26 August 2007
Violence without sense,,4.0,16 March 2005
"a great movie, worth watching several times","I saw this movie for the first time on a pay per view channel together with my dad. He thought it was not bad, but I was entranced. The second I got home I bought it (it was one of the first DVD's that I ever bought).

I've shown it to over 50 people by now and they all agree on one thing, it has some amazing parts in it. Even people who really didn't like the movie, loved the fight scene in the middle, it has comedy, extreme violence and some good old fighting.

This movie is in my top 5 favorites of all time and the only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because after watching it as many times as I have some scenes get a bit boring.

This movie has it all, plot twists that would make M. Night Shyamalan confused, action that would make john woo proud, sex scene's that are worthy to be in a porn, and action that should've gotten an Oscar.

If you haven't seen it yet, do so now. If you've seen it but didn't get it watch it again. And if you're like me and love it, just watch it for the fun of it again.",9.0,7 March 2008

Filmmaker Chan-wook Park (who co-wrote with Jo-yun Hwang, Chun-hyeong Lim, Joon-hyung Lim and Garon Tsuchiya) has a strong visual sense overall with his many layered edits and camera angles askew yet ultimately the film suffers in the overblown last act yet Choi makes a very original anti-hero with echoes of Charles Bronson and the ""Death Wish"" films but something seems lost in the translation with its execution although there are a few highlights including some visceral fight sequences and the edge-on-your-seat intrigue as to how the payoff will finally arrive.",7.0,28 March 2005

Interesting Premise That Ultimately Fails,"I think the best word to sum up how I felt after watching Oldboy was ""frustrated."" The premise underlying the film is an interesting take-off of The Count of Monte Cristo and it certainly promises a lot of potential. And the director certainly cannot be accused of taking obvious directions to appease the masses. I certainly paid close attention to Oldboy and, admittedly, watched it a second time. But in all honesty, I did not enjoy it and I can say wholeheartedly that this must be one of the most overrated films on IMDb.

Like many of Oldboy's harshest critics, my major problem with the film was the big ""twist"" - - the reason Dae Su was imprisoned. This twist was completely preposterous. Even in the realm of fantasy/action films, I just could not swallow it. It felt like the kind of cheap twist you would find in a B slasher movie like Prom Night. Unlike films like Sixth Sense, where you can re-watch and see connections that lead to the surprise twist, you can't do that with Oldboy. Further, the twist does not fit with the overall mood of the film. Oldboy strives for a real and grim atmosphere but the major villain's plan fits better with a James Bond film.

Oldboy has other problems. Its action set-pieces are not particularly impressive and are few and far between. There is no action scene that will stick out in your mind, like Hard-boiled or The Killer. Yes, there are some seat-squirming graphic revenge scenes, but even they are not as ""extreme"" as advertised.

Ultimately, Oldboy's success hinges on the suspense and impact of its major plot twist and, given its implausibility, the film falters and falls on its face. I have seen that this film has been scheduled for a re-make and, despite generally disliking remakes, I think Oldboy is an excellent candidate. Somewhere in this muddled mess is a great idea that, with the right script, could make an excellent movie.",6.0,3 February 2006

A Masterpiece,"First of all, I want to clarify that I'd personally give Oldboy a score of 9.2 or so but given the nature of IMDb's rating system if you like a movie you gotta give it a 10 Where to begin? From the amazing score by Jo Yeong-wook to the compelling and skillful acting of Choi Min-sik, Oldboy is, all the way through, a masterpiece. Few movies manage to be so gripping and at the same time so emotional. Oldboy tells the story of Oh Dae-su, a middle-aged drunkard who, after one of his many late-night drunken endeavors, mysteriously disappears off the face of the earth, leaving his wife and daughter. Turns out Oh Daeu-su is actually imprisoned in what seems to be a hotel room and he has to spend the next 15 years of his life there with no other human connection. After he is finally released, Oh Dae-su, now a shell of his former self, embarks on a quest to find the man responsible for his mysterious imprisonment and his reasons behind it.

Oldboy is a great journey through human psyche and you will find yourself thinking about it way after you've watched it. A must-watch for anyone who enjoys good cinema.",10.0,14 October 2015
Great Korean revenge thriller,"Awesome movie with great cinematography, plot, characters and twists, but I'd say it's not for everyone, beacuse it's pretty dark and has a lot of rough scenes, e.g. A squid which is eaten alive.

I recently read the manga by Garon Tsuchiya and Nobuaki Minegishi and I think, that Park Chan-Wook did a great job out of this mediocre source. The manga is like a 6/10, because the pacing was very slow, the fight scenes weren't as good as in the movie, and the final plot ""twist"" was boring. I liked, that the dialogues were better, it filled a few little plottholes and clarified a few things of the movie, which were kinda complicated.

I recommend reading the manga before watching the movie, but if you only watch the movie you won't miss anything.",9.0,16 November 2021

A Twisted Web of Vengeance and Intrigue,"Enter the labyrinth of vengeance and psychological intricacy in Park Chan-wook's Oldboy, a film that unfurls like a dark tapestry of torment and retribution. Oldboy is a masterclass in storytelling, weaving a narrative that seamlessly blends elements of mystery, suspense, and psychological horror. The film's visual language creates an atmospheric tension that lingers long after the credits roll. The cinematography is both visceral and poetic, reflecting the duality of the human experience.

As a narrative puzzle unfolds, the film explores the fragility of memory, the weight of guilt, and the consequences of revenge. The labyrinthine plot is fraught with unexpected twists that keep the audience on the edge of their seats. It's a story that challenges perceptions, leaving us to question the boundaries of morality and the true cost of justice. The film doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of human nature, confronting the audience with uncomfortable truths that linger in the shadows.

From the very first frame, Oldboy plunges its audience into a labyrinthine narrative, where the enigmatic Oh Dae-su, portrayed with raw intensity by Choi Min-sik, finds himself inexplicably imprisoned for 15 years, his only company the haunting memories of an unknown tormentor. Choi Min-sik's portrayal of Dae-su is a tour de force, capturing the relentless determination and psychological toll of a man on a quest for answers. The viewer is held captive by the film's intricate web of suspense, and just when it seems the story's crescendo has been reached, enters the long corridor scene, a feat of cinematic audacity that raises the bar for choreography, cinematography and narrative integration.

The corridor fight, which unfolds as a single, unbroken take, is a symphony of brutality choreographed with a rhythmic cadence that juxtaposes grace and violence. As Oh Dae-su unleashes his pent-up fury upon a relentless wave of adversaries, the camera follows his every move with a hypnotic fluidity, transcending the boundaries of conventional filmmaking. This unrelenting shot, lasting a staggering four minutes, immerses the audience into the visceral essence of the struggle, blurring the line between spectator and participant. What sets this scene apart is not merely its technical bravado, but its narrative significance. The corridor, symbolizing the tortuous path of vengeance and redemption, becomes a canvas on which Oh Dae-su's metamorphosis is painted. Each blow and parry is not just physical combat, but a psychological confrontation, a battle against his own demons. Park Chan-wook ingeniously melds form and content, using the corridor as a physical and metaphorical arena for Oh Dae-su's existential ordeal.

In an era where filmic excellence often yields to the allure of CGI and contrived action, Oldboy stands as a beacon of authenticity. Its corridor scene, devoid of visual trickery, exalts the art of filmmaking itself, reminding us of the potential for innovation within the boundaries of human creativity.

In the Korean cinematic history, Oldboy is more than a fleeting spectacle-they are a magnum opus that reaffirms the power of storytelling, the magic of the moving image, and the unbounded capabilities of a dedicated creative team. As the corridor becomes a stage for Oh Dae-su's reckoning, it simultaneously becomes a stage for cinema's triumph.

The thematic exploration of isolation, manipulation, and the cyclical nature of violence adds layers to the film's narrative. Odboy is a testament to the enduring impact of trauma, revealing how the past, once buried, can resurface to exact a devastating toll on the present. It's a cinematic enigma, a psychological thriller that leaves an indelible mark on the psyche. Park Chan-wook's masterful direction, combined with stellar performances, creates an immersive experience that resonates with the complexities of the human condition.",8.0,22 January 2024
Ants In Pants,"Visually stunning and stylishly executed, Chan-wook Park's 'Oldboy' is loosely based on 'Oedipus' and 'The Count of Monte Cristo'. On the technical front, it gets almost everything right. The background score is marvelous. The action sequences are well shot even though poorly choreographed. The cinematography and visuals are stunning. The CGI is fake at times (for example the ant crawling under the skin scene). The dialogues are wannabe symbolic and wannabe philosophical. The acting is over-the-top. I didn't see any point in the movie as a whole. Nor did 'Oldboy' entertain me neither did it enlighten. I fail to understand what puts this film on a World Cinema level and what is it that so many love about this movie? Was it the shock value with all the gruesome and gory scenes? It starts on an interesting note but then one finds out that it's a silly contrived revenge plot (not to mention the numerous plot holes). What was Park trying to imply? That it's okay for the brother to have sex with his sister and that Dae-Su's telling someone about it in confidence was the bigger crime? Or is it that the best revenge would be to make him have sex with his own daughter? Don't even get me started on the whole hypnosis-erasing-your-memory crap. In my humble opinion, 'Oldboy' is quite a stupid pretentious movie. It's executed quite well but has no substance. A waste of my time.",,4 July 2008
Savage Plot Saved by Imagery and Sound,"""Oldboy"" is best viewed on a clean slate. I knew nothing about it before watching it, only that a friend recommend it. Similar in fashion to ""Donnie Darko"" or ""Fight Club"" this is a film that once you know the twist and how it ends (and this has a climax ripped right from the bleeding heart of a Greek tragedy) it probably won't hold up on repeat viewing all that well. As such, I will probably avoid watching it again, as it was oddly endearing and I would rather remember it well than think about it too much and ruin the experience.

A simplistic and twisted revenge plot gets shrouded in claustrophobic mystery and visual chutzpah (the camera work and color scheming are intense and satisfying, a stunning blend of Scorsese and Zhang Zimou) that tricks the unsuspecting viewer into thinking they are watching something more special than it really is. There's also a fantastic music score blending classical pieces with techno music. The music and the imagery last in the viewer's mind long after the film ends. Unfortunately the story line and characters do not. I suppose on a simple motion picture level (where one views film-making as a purely visual and sound art form) the film is a rousing success. However, if you wish to view film as a story telling art form, this repetitive and contrived motion picture fails miserably. Already pegged for a Hollywood remake that will no doubt pummel the style over substance nature of the film into the ground.",7.0,13 February 2005

An absolute masterpiece of film making,"I cannot find any faults in this movie. Everything from the story, the acting, the cinematography, the soundtrack, everything is perfection.

This film does what other try to do...it doesn't insist upon itself nor dose it treat the viewer as an idiot.

It shows the viewer the information you need to know through the dialogue and actions of the characters.

It is a mystery which is up to you to unsolve, however, it drops clues and innuendos, and does it masterfully.

This is a film every film maker should study and interpret, as there is no better film out there.

The story is captivating and provocative.

The twist will blow your mind.

The motives of the characters are masterfully unraveled in a gut wrenching, soul searching way.

I was completely glued to the screen, wanting to know the end game, and anticipating the next move.

It has one of the best choreographed fight signs in all of cinema.

The main character is relatable in a way that I haven't experienced in cinema before.

I even had sympathy for the antagonist.

The supporting characters are interesting and at times comical, and I loved every second of this movie,.

The ending is unlike anything I have ever seen, and this movie honestly left me speechless.

I have since compared every movie to this one, and nothing comes close.

This is truly a masterpiece, and deserves so much more credit than it gets.

The hallway scene, is an amazing shot that has since been replicated by a number of other films, even the recent Netflix, ""Daredevil,' show features something very similar. This is the kind of movie you can watch 4 or 5 times and notice new things each time, even new character developments and motivations. The foreshadowing is done in such a way that it doesn't beat you over the head, but is clear if you know what you're looking for/watching it again. A fantastic film.",9.0,1 September 2015

The psychological horror and struggle is presented so well and I left this movie thinking about the lessons and questions it presented me with. This movie made me think in ways no other movie has managed to do before.

The story is also dark and twisted and doesn't shy away from showing everything. Which I think is amazing, it's so bold and unapologetic and it really helps the story develop properly.

It's a little bit much,"(2003) Oldboy (In Korean with English subtitles) PSYCHOLOGICAL HORROR

Part II of Chan-wook Park's ""vengeance"" trilogy where each of the three films are unrelated to one another and can be seen without watching the other- they are only related in terms of the theme of ""vengeance""! In this second installment, from the first 20 minutes centers on a drunken man who gets himself kidnapped by an unknown assailant before he is drugged and locked in an armored room, with the only communication he has with the outside world is a television set depriving him from society for 15 years. But once he finally gets out, he swears revenge on the people or persons responsible for this, except that it's very hard for him to adjust to society again. That his abnormality once going to his first sea food restaurant after 15 years in captivity, he asks for something alive, and the lady serving him brings him a live octopus in which he stuffs it into his mouth, starts gnawing on it and is still alive upon him falling asleep! Many twists and turns, revelations happen as he increasingly becomes more obsessed about the perpetrators or perpetrator involved with every new thing he finds out- the revelations becomes much more more sickening than the last! As mentioned, the real movie doesn't start until he's been let out, or has escape and goes on a blind splurge to find out what had really happened and why with little discourse from the police who're almost non- existent this time. I thought this film was interesting since I had seen films that 're similar to this, but it only gets interesting only until after at a certain point, since as the film progresses , I started to care even less and they're shocking almost predictable after seeing the first ""Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance""!

Feel Good Movie of 2003,"Sometimes a film leaves you with that warm, fuzzy feeling inside. It's a feeling of fulfillment and completion. A feeling that everything will work out and everyone is okay Oldboy is NOT one of those films.

Drunken buffoon Dae-su (Choi) is mysteriously kidnapped and inexplicably held prisoner for fifteen years by men he never sees. He is left only to watch the same television and eat the same dumplings every day. When he is just as inexplicably released back into a world that is now completely alien to him, his only mission becomes finding the man who imprisoned him, by any means necessary.

The twists and turns Dae-su's journey takes him down are jaw- droppingly outside the box, leaving the audience only to wonder whether Park is a thematic genius or completely insane nihilist. Based on an equally messed up graphic novel by Nobuaki Minegishi, Oldboy has become one of the best thrillers of all time, capped by one of the best blindsides that has ever been thrown at unsuspecting viewers.

Spike Lee attempted an American remake in 2013 starring Josh Brolin, which isn't entirely terrible in and of itself, but it's hard to match the intensity put forward by Park. If you haven't seen this film, don't ruin it by reading into it too much. Just turn the lights down, turn the flick on and begin to feel incredibly uncomfortable by the fact that at any moment someone out there could be plotting to absolutely destroy your life for no reason.",9.0,27 January 2016

I'm not going to talk about the plot other than to say it is a roller coaster of emotions , twists and turns and keeps you interested throughout- it is unique. The direction makes you feel you are right there in what is happening, one of those movies where you really don't want to pause it or miss a single second. . Min-sik Choi, as the main character -Oh Dae-Su is incredibly good, his transformations throughout are worthy of any acting award going... I loved this film.

Having an overwhelming experience as a viewer and being blown away by a crazy scenario ? Nobody asked you to agree with what happens in the movie, nor did the director ask you such a thing. So many of the reviewers that gave very low scores because they were shocked by this movie, actually compliment the director and all the other people that worked on this movie. Crazy masterpiece !",10.0,29 September 2022
brilliant brilliant brilliant,"I'll echo the majority of the viewers' sentiments, this film is brilliant.

I really did not know what to expect when I first sat down to watch it, except that I'd hoped it would be a good thriller from a well respected Korean director.

And that's how you should approach this film if you haven't watched it, expect nothing, because that's when you get the most out of it. I've read a couple of reviews regarding the ""incomprehensible"" plot and ""rambling storyline"" and it beggars belief how these people have come to this conclusion.

In terms of plot and storyline, it's one of the most original and tightly controlled I've ever watched. From the start, when a man is put in a private jail without explanation for 15 years, you're drawn into the story. Then it just gets better.

Acting by the two central characters, the antagonist and the protagonist - at times they easily swap places, such is the clever story line and the brilliant acting - is outstanding. The energy and the inner rage with which both go about the roles was just brilliant to watch.

The music score was pretty much perfect for any film I've come across and the main melody is as memorable as any you're likely to come across in any medium.

The twists are not over-egged, as they don't need to be, and the gut-wrenching, brutal yet emotionally charged penultimate scene will stay with you for a long time afterwards. This film is in my top 10 of all time. Just watch it with an open mind. It's a great, great film.",,18 August 2011
Severely overrated,"I had heard about this film for years from friends , film lovers & critics and all I ever heard was how great this film was so naturally I was really excited to see what it had to offer.

I have watched a lot of films over the past few years and I could almost tell from the trailer that this film is more sensational than ""good"" (whatever that means).

It is in fact a sensationalized , supremely petty , intensely symbolic mess of a revenge flick.

Is a film good because it's cruel & shocking ? Does that empty feeling you get after watching such a mess count as an artful impact ?

You'll either love it or hate it. I in fact hate this film.

A different story of revenge...,"The leading character of the story is a family man who killed his wife. It is not clear how he did it or why he did it though. In the opening scene, he was to go home bringing angel's wings stuff for her sweet plum - his daughter. But he was kidnapped before he can walk any further, and he was kept in a secure special prison for 15 years.

In those 15 long years, he entertained himself in watching TV, writing a journal, and training himself in fighting. He was served dumplings every time, and most often he doesn't eat the food being served to him. Little by little, he digs a hole in the wall covered by his bedside. He just use a chopstick to do it, and he planned to get outside on the 15th year of his stay...

When he gets out, his first mission was to find his capturer. and the tragedy just keeps getting better from there.

After I watched the film, I made a donation to the website where I watched it. It was the best of tragedies I have ever watched. You can say it to yourself.",10.0,23 October 2007
The kind of movie that won't grow old.,"An alcoholic father and husband is captured and kept in captivity during 15 years without knowing why. When he gets out, he's hell-bent on revenge and discovering why he was imprisoned. This is a powerful movie with strong dramatic performances. It's intense and constantly keeps you on your toes. The story is amazing and full of twists and turns until the very end. Speaking of twists, the film is a bit twisted in itself by the themes it portrays. It does make us question what is moral and acceptable in revenge. The directing is bold and inventive.

There's a long fight scene without cuts in a corridor that's practically an anthology piece. Other memorable moments involve teeth and a tongue. Notice how the director often plays with our expectations showing relatively little but creeping us out nevertheless. The story also plays with our perceptions of the characters, making them more or less sympathetic. The main character has quite the character arc transformation, completely changing physically and psychologically during the course while keeping the viewer on edge because he's a bit unstable... So, it's overall quite fascinating, intellectually stimulating, viscerally gripping, and heartily recommended provided you don't expect a simple, typical revenge movie and you keep an open mind.

some like it... Oedipean,"This is not a movie for the faint of heart. But, for those willing to go the extra mile, it will be an unexpected pleasant surprise. If any of the following ring a bell: ""Code 46"", ""Irréversible"" or ""The Truman Show"" you'll get your money's worth with this movie. If by the end of it, you're disappointed that it doesn't give you any higher purpose, tough luck.

About the action: a shabby semi-good guy, loaded with TV clichés tries to catch up with a superb villain. Nobody wins or, better said, they both loose. There's no elaborate story line, no claims of realism whatsoever. It's not so much about a gory revenge but more about a dark, sinuous journey for redemption.

If this movie teaches you anything, it's no to look for greater-than-life answers in fortune cookies. Or movies, for that matter.

What a great head trip,"It was 1988 Seoul and Oh Dae-Su got drunk on his daughter's birthday. After his friend Joo-Hwan got him out of the police station, he is kidnapped off the streets. He is imprisoned in a motel-like cell. He gets gassed periodically without explanation. After 15 years, he is released from a giant suitcase on top of a building. There's a strange guy with a poodle who falls to his death. A bum gives him money and a cellphone. A mysterious man calls to taunt him. He passes out in a sushi restaurant and the cute chef Mi-do takes him home. They both have had hallucinations of ants. His daughter is adopted and living in Stockholm after his wife was murder and he's assumed to be the culprit. He discovers the prison where he was imprisoned. The wealthy Lee Woo-jin reveals himself as his tormentor with a deadly threat against every women that he loves.

As I watched this, I kept thinking of David Lynch and to lesser extend Quentin Tarantino. It's got the bloody violent revenge plot at the center of this. What I love more is the weird surreal touches. There's no way that a guy is going to eat a live octopus in any Hollywood movie. It is such a strange plot move to find a place by how a dumpling taste.

I believe that it is the first time that I comment on a film and gives 9/10. I NEVER give 10/10 cause NOTHING is perfect. But this movie is near perfection. This Korean film is remarkable. WOWWWWWWWWWWWW !!!!!!!!!!!!!

All is good in this film. Actors and actresses, photography, music, and of course the history (the scenario).

That made well at least 20 years that I had not seen a film of this kind.

It is well one of rare Asian films where nudity is seen (without vulgarity of course).

I would give a Oscar for this film. But unfortunately it is not as that which that it's work in Hollywood. It is necessary to form part of the ""Hollywood Clan"".

I hope that the authors of this film will continue to make also remarkable films and that it will not make like

Hollywood. To make turnips and to only think of the money.

In any case Korean gives a good cinematographic lesson to American.

I you council highly to buy this film because it is a rare masterpiece since they are 25 last years.

The downright audacious writing is admirable, throwing the blueprint away and coming up with this amazing revenge story, told in a smart and powerful manner. I reckon that the mountain of revenge films that have come out in the last while owe this film a debt of gratitude. The cinematography, soundtrack and choreography are all something special, as is the acting, notably from Min-sik Choi. His exhaustion from this demanding role actually shows in some scenes.

A gripping classic,,,21 August 2023
"Less you know about it, more you can enjoy its forbidden, adventurous and a bumpy ride","It is one of those movies where you can neither guess the reason for the revenge nor the actual end play (by midway). Definitely the emphasis is on style over substance, glorifying goriness than the emotional connect and acting is definitely not its strong suite. Despite its emotional and language barriers, it is a victory for movie making by having a stranglehold on audience attention up until 90% of the movie.

Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) is a careless drunk and has rubbed many people the wrong way. On his daughter's birthday, he is abducted and put in a room without giving a reason for the cause. He is put in an independent room of an apartment without any scope for a conversation except for a television, mostly drugged, fed the same duck dumpling and occasionally visited by a hypnotist. As he prepares himself by learning boxing and other martial arts from what he can gather from television to extract revenge on the person who might have done this to him and also digging a tunnel in parallel for his escape, one fine day he is let off after 15 years. Can he do what he has been preparing for?

It is a captivating premise to be imprisoned without knowing the reason and source while also keeping the audience in the same state of ignorant mind as the protagonist. This establishes an empathy from the audience who will embark on a journey with the protagonist till the end of story (or the reveal). As the hype builds up over a period of time, it cannot be fizzled out with a run-of-the-mill reason and that's where the story kicks into another least expected dimension. All the loopholes and misfires are temporarily forgotten and we change to the new ride and hop along with a renewed interest which again acts in the movie's favor.

A special mention should go to Ji-tae Yu who plays the character Woo-jin Lee, he does it with such elan that makes you think that you are not just seeing a good vs. evil story. The story and screenplay is well thought out and executed that greatly influences how the editing eventually turns out. While the boldness of the content is surely to be appreciated in a mainstream cinema, the way it ends is what emphasizes the grayness of the human mind. A classic generally attributes to how the audience reacted to it rather than how well it is made, in that aspect Oldboy definitely is a cult classic that overcomes the goofy acting, uneven scenes and continuity issues to become something that is much more.

A Dark and Distinctive Thriller That Leaves an Unsettling Impression,"""Oldboy"" stands as a cinematic enigma, offering a plot that is undeniably different and capable of keeping audiences hooked from the beginning. However, beneath the surface of its unique narrative lies a film that can be described as nothing short of disturbing.

The storyline takes unexpected turns, creating a gripping atmosphere of mystery and suspense. The unconventional plot is a departure from conventional narratives, and its ability to keep viewers intrigued is commendable. The film delves into the psyche of its characters, presenting a dark and haunting exploration of human nature.

However, the overall impact of ""Oldboy"" can be overshadowed by its disturbing elements. The film doesn't shy away from visceral and unsettling scenes, leaving a lasting impression that extends beyond the screen. The visceral nature of the narrative may prove to be a divisive factor, with some viewers finding it difficult to reconcile with the film's darker aspects.

While the movie is undoubtedly a unique piece of cinema, its disturbing content can overshadow its storytelling brilliance for some audiences. It's a challenging watch that elicits a range of emotions, from fascination to discomfort.

In conclusion, ""Oldboy"" is a film that demands attention for its distinctiveness and ability to keep viewers engaged with its unusual plot. However, the overall experience is marked by a sense of discomfort and unease, making it a movie that may not be suitable for everyone. If you're prepared for a dark and challenging journey into the human psyche, ""Oldboy"" offers a unique cinematic experience, but be forewarned of its potential to leave you with a sense of unease.",7.0,11 July 2020
I don't get it; what's the hype all about?,,5.0,16 June 2018
"Shocking! A must-see, if you have the stomach for it","To be hones I'm in a shock right now.

The story of Oldboy is absolutely horrible. And no, I don't mean it's written badly, I mean the story is so horrifying that after I was done I just had to sit and stare the screen for a while. The only thought in my head is: ""What the hell did I just see?"" This is the beauty of movies with clever plot twists that actually do surprise you: Oldboy, Primal Fear, Fight Club... I'm sure there are many more, but just making a list would be lazy. The plot twist in Primal Fear is just surprising. It's clever, but the thing is, it's not that bad. while Oldboy... That plot twist is absolutely shocking. And the story is well written even when you don't count the plot twist. The main character's narration gives a lot more interest to the story. The mystery is intriguing, and the writers have a way of keeping the viewer invested in the story. Even when you don't really like Oh Dae-Su, you still want to know why. And even Oh Dae-Su is not really a likable character, you still wonder if he deserved that. That would be an interesting philosophical debate.

There are a few group fight scenes in this film, and they are excellent. They are well coordinated and enjoyable (or as enjoyable as fight scenes are) to watch. The visual side of Oldboy amazes with how good it looks when it needs to. There were few gore-y scenes, yet nothing too horrifying was shown, so something was left to imagination. Still those scenes keep you on the edge of your seat.

Oldboy is a very well made movie. It's shocking, and I'm not sure how good it is when you watch it a second time, but at least after this first time I am astonished - and shocked. I'd love to recommend this movie but I don't know how risky that would be.",8.0,20 February 2016

Eating Octopus is as customary as eating sushi and sashimi.,"Some Koreans enjoy eating living octopus though other Koreans don't. It is just as the same as eating sushi and sashimi.

For me, Oldboy to Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is what Koryo Blue Porcelain to Chosen White Porcelain. Each film has its own attraction but OldBoy is much more decorative than Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance which shows the beauty and power of the simplicity.

It's nice but there are shortcomings,"Before starting the film review, it is important to note that ""Oldboy"" has gained cult status since its release in 2003 and has generally been well received by film critics. In this review, I will analyze and evaluate the film from various aspects.

Park Chan-wook's ""Oldboy"" is a striking South Korean production that occupies a unique place in cinema history. The film skillfully combines a complex story, violent scenes, and unforgettable characters to provide an enchanting experience for the audience. Choi Min-sik's magnificent performance is one of the most important elements that captivate the audience throughout the film.

First and foremost, the story of ""Oldboy"" is extraordinarily poignant and gripping. Oh Dae-su's quest for revenge creates a tension that keeps the audience glued to the screen from beginning to end. Park Chan-wook masterfully increases the tension while telling the story and introduces the characters to the audience by delving into their depths. In particular, the final twist of the film subverts viewers' expectations and makes the film unforgettable.

Additionally, the visual elements of ""Oldboy"" are noteworthy. Park Chan-wook's cinematography and the color palette used enhance the atmosphere throughout the film and draw the audience into the story. Similarly, the music and sound effects support the film and enhance the emotional impact of the scenes.

However, ""Oldboy"" also contains violence scenes and heavy themes that may be disturbing to some viewers. While the film offers an in-depth look at the darkest aspects of human nature, it includes violence and sexuality that may be unsettling for some viewers. Therefore, it is important to issue a sensitivity warning before deciding to watch the film.

Overall, ""Oldboy"" is a masterpiece with its extraordinary story, impressive performances, and visually stunning scenes. Park Chan-wook's masterful direction and Choi Min-sik's unforgettable performance ensure that the film leaves a deep impact on the audience. Therefore, it is highly recommended for fans of the film. I give ""Oldboy"" a rating of 7.7 because this film occupies an important place in the world of cinema and provides viewers with an unforgettable experience.",7.0,17 February 2024

An acquired taste,"I saw this for the first time the same week I watched Battle Royale. With the other movie, it's very high concept and very violent, but I much preferred it.

The issue with oldboy is there is an intriguing mystery in the middle of all of this. Why has he been locked up for 15 years? It's a great conceit, but the payoff, personally for me, doesn't work.

The films violence is so heightened it shares more in common with Battle Royale than it does with a great drama. And yet despite the ridiculousness of the central character and the overall plot, nobody is having any fun. Everybody is very serious and the climax for me was overblown melodrama which I didn't believe at all.

The direction is incredible, the very famous scenes are quite rightly highly regarded. But it's quite a long movie for quite a slight idea which you either go with or don't. This movie clearly isn't for everyone it didn't work for me - you have been warned.",7.0,29 January 2024

Oldboy is one of those films that starts out strong, builds you up the whole way through, and then ends with a bang, leaving you satisfied and thinking back at what a great film it was. It follows a lonely man who has many problems but refuses to face them. The movie guides him through a healing path where he discovers the mistakes he made in his life and as a result pays the consequences for them. It really makes the viewer draw many parallels between his or her life and the life of our tragic hero in the film. Not to mention it is beautifully filmed.

This film is quite slow to get going but its fitting that you get eased in to the film. It's a very disturbing film and extremely graphic in places. However, I do think its all in keeping with the storyline.

To me this is a must see film as a result of the acting, the twists throughout and overall difference that the film puts out to the standard US based movie!

Octopus Sushimi - Tasty Snack or Foul Meal ?,"Old Boy is a slick action thriller that is both entertaining and ultimately thought provoking. Fincher's 'Fight Club' and Miike's 'Ichi The Killer' have both been raised as stylistic comparisons and there is a lot of merit to this perspective.

Essentially, it is about a man's imprisonment and subsequent quest for vengeance against his initially unknown captor. To state more than that would be to spoil a film that relies upon a significant plot-twist. This plot twist has been much discussed. Further, there appears to be a significant amount of ambiguity in the final scene that leaves it open to interpretation as to whether the protagonist has 'taken steps' to move on from the events, or whether he is still a warped monster of revenge.

It is safe to say that it is a niche film - one for people who like overt cinematic technique - namely flashy visuals and inventive action sequences. My personal bias is towards such films that take an innovative approach to visuals and for this reason, and the provocative ending, I found it to be a very good film.

I think that most people would find it entertaining to some degree. Whether they would find it a good film is a matter of debate. There have been a great many reviews extolling the merits of the film and many eloquent criticisms - both are equally valid.

There are continuity lapses and some facile quasi deus ex machina (omnipotent villain) explanations, but in particular, I think the charge of nihilism is quite accurate. It is not a movie where the message is obvious, or indeed one where you could really categorise as having something profound to say about the futility of revenge or the human condition. That said, as a stylish piece of entertainment I enjoyed it immensely. I have seen Park Chan-Wook's 'JSA' and 'Sympathy For Mr Vengeance' and preferred this film. Whether this makes me a vapid pop-culture victim, so be it, but I honestly have a better time seeing something like 'Performance' or '...if' or even 'Ichi The Killer' than 'The Sorrow and the Pity' or 'Through a Glass Darkly'.

Vengeance is the culmination of almost every emotion the human mind is capable of understanding, and some we don't. Chanwook Park has written, directed and produced three film that tackle the psychology, philosophy and grand theme of vengeance, and Oldboy is the second installment and probably the most important.

the story is quite convoluted, and much of it should be left to be witnessed with virgin eyes and ears, but sufficing to say that a sully drunk named Oh Dae Su is captured by a man with a purple umbrella one rainy evening after a few hours in the drunk tank. he is kept in a small motel room with a fake window, a TV, an eerie painting and a gas pipe for the duration of 15 years. during this time, he witnesses his wife and child murdered on the 11 o'clock news, and he is framed for it. Dae Su sort of goes into a slow state of focused madness. his body becomes tough and trained, his hair becomes shaggy and beast-like, and his wrist becomes an hourglass, counting the years in checks until his release. When Dae Su is released, he is no longer Dae su, but something else, he's a beast, a monster, an unstoppable force of vengeance created by the rage and sorrow of the former Dae su. he still looks like the same disheveled 40-something, but there is a deadness to him, a crouching killer waiting to spring on his pray- the people who killed his family and put him in that horrible place, but with all the anger inside Dae Su, there still lurks a very human being, one so desperate for contact with another life after 15 years of deprivation, he consumes a living creature as his first meal upon release. this is only the first half hour of the film, and it's really the simplest part of the plot to explain- a precurser. this should give you an idea of how deep and dark this film plunges into the human psyche. for all it's cartoonish moments and stylish look and feel, Oldboy is unmatched in its well of emotion and deeply human story. you are not asked to take what you see as literal occurrence, but rather to accept what you see and draw meaning from it. there are some scenes many people find obligatory, consciously shocking or just plain gross, but they are all necessary in order to understand the epicness of this tale.

on a technical scale, Park has taken a complete divergance from his previous effort- Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and instead gone into a kind of surrealist filmnoir-meets-hong-Kong wonder-world from which this fantastical story can be properly told in the grandios form it requires.

a lot of people disliked the ending to this movie, and if you watch this film the same way you watch something like Fight Club or Memento (both fine films) then you wont like it either, but this isn't fight club or memento, this is Shakespeare, this is Homer, this is what lies beneath the gloss and dirt. the core. the story itself is unimportant, it's what the story implies that makes it a masterpiece.

i mourn the idea of remaking this film, giving the helm to the man who'll do Fast and the Furious 3, and making the main character go to prison rather than the original mysterious hotel room. all the things that make Oldboy Oldboy are gone, and all we're left with is the homage of someone who obviously missed the point. so i urge you to see this version of the story before it becomes a bastardized memory of itself stuffed into a Pepsi advertisement.",10.0,23 March 2006

Great,"Oldboy (2003)

*** 1/2 (out of 4)

After being kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years, a man has five days to learn what it was all about and seek revenge on those behind it. I've only seen director Chan-wook Park's Three...Extremes before this here but I'm certainly going to be seeking more out. As with the other film, the ""wow"" moment in this one here is worth everything that comes before it and makes your jaw just hit the floor. I'm not sure if others caught onto what was going on but I thought I did. I thought I knew the whole story of why he was kidnapped and why that certain man wanted revenge but when that twists come...nothing prepared me for that. Min-sik Choi was terrific in the film as was the supporting players. I also liked the fact that the director mixed in lots of humor even with all the over the top violence and that shocking twist at the end.",,29 February 2008
About Incest,"The brutal and almost perverted revenge caused by an unfavorable love is bound to be achieved by causing another unfavorable love. Ignoring the fierce bloody and psychological distortion process for a while, the theme of the film is clearly cleared in a clearer way. This incident of incest is faced with the brave posture of resistance shown by today's powerful ethical and moral system, and some kind of interpersonal crisis of modern people revealed in this stiff and unpretentious posture. Just as Marquez said in his magical realism masterpiece, the end of incest-a person with a pig tail, modern biological science can also testify to it, incest will lead to deformity of future generations due to the similarity between genes. However, the reason why incest has become a taboo is not such a biological reason. To trace back the history of mankind with the population of the earth today, we can simply make a simple estimate of the population of thousands of years ago or even ancient times, and then we have come up with an impossible number. Such a fact of population growth. This incident proves that incest is not a long-forbidden and rare, but a basic fact of human beings for millions of years. The reason is very simple, it is just a small number of people. In fact, it is difficult to imagine a social organization without incest. Because incest succeeded in preparing the network of in-laws, it enabled the continuation of society, and people in any society without it would be unsustainable. The birth and reproduction of human beings, from the necessary combination of men and women to family construction to today's monogamy, is a long evolutionary story. From the initial biological, physical, and slowly to the so-called cultural and social evolutionary path of today. One of the basic premises for its realization is the gradual increase in the number of people, so that people no longer have to choose whom to combine from in-laws; at the same time, another more important reason is not fertility distortion, but incest. The disorder caused by human relations makes incest gradually unnecessary and further becomes a taboo. Therefore, the original primordial incest can actually be generated naturally; now incest has become a problem again. It is actually artificial. The most important thing is of course all kinds of sexual taboo thinking, which causes the so-called sexual repression. Sex has become a shame and even a sinful thing, and the lust can't find an exit. It makes people return to the ancient stone carvings that have only direct blood relatives and only a few heterosexual blood relatives in disguise. . In this way, incest seems to have gone from the ancient ""naturally forced"" occurrence to today's ""artificially forced"" occurrence. And this is the most important reason for the film to be almost invisible but concealed under the modern incest system. Finally, in the wilderness and snow of the desert, the father realized the detached love with his daughter by choosing to forget. This scene is like the ancient moment when humans are scattered in the earth, but the truth is that this is an extra-legal place free from ethics and social taboos. Love itself is not guilty, even if it is not good, who has hurt it? In fact, it is meaningless to discuss the actual rationality of the ending. It is just a window that condenses the airtight cultural and moral system constructed for modern human civilization, and a buffer that dispels the pressure of the system. Belt for some people who can't bear the burden to take a breath.",7.0,25 April 2020

Overrated,"I went to see this movie because it had a 8.6 rating at IMDb.com. How can people overrate it like that?

The first 90 minutes were sooo boring. The whole movie, you wait for something to happen which explains everything. And when that happens in the end, it's just a disappointment. The story is unrealistic, the dialogues are poor (and no they are NOT intellectual, for all wannabe-intellectuals - not only since the few wise sentences have to be repeated five times for everybody to remember them). The few messages could've been brought to the viewer in a much more entertaining way.

Like in David Lynch movies, Oldboy forces you to think about it, and think about it, try to find a deeper sense, and while you are watching you realize that there is none - and that's just poor.",4.0,8 September 2004
absolutely unforgettable,"I came into this film knowing absolutely nothing about it. My manager said ""buy it, it's AMAZING"". First of all, the plot. After a man has a terribly drunk night, he ends up imprisoned for 15 years without knowing who imprisoned him and why. When he is released, he is given a new suit, a cell phone, and ends up at a sushi restaurant, where he meets Mi-do. Along with Mi-do, to save those he cares about most, Oh-Daesu is given 5 days to figure out who imprisoned him and why. This film definitely focuses on the fact that even the smallest things can blow up out of proportion, and the results can be catastrophic. The acting is by far the best I've seen in Asian cinema, and the writing is fantastic. I highly recommend. 10 stars all the way.",10.0,2 July 2006
Squid Pro Quo,"This is one heck of a film experience, a cinematic joyride unlike any in recent memory. A well-crafted tight package it is, of electrifying acting performance (Choi Min-Sik is simply great), innovative cinematography, unbelievably warped story line, bone-jarring action, black humor, all fortified by a moody and captivating music score(it tends to lodge in the recesses of one's right hemisphere, and won't leave).

A role that demands a tremendous emotional range, Choi Min-Sik gives one of the most memorable acting performances in recent years. We see a man brimming with bottled up rage for vengeance barreling his way towards the inevitable encounter with his nemesis, and when the moment arrives, we are witness to a heart-wrenching transformation of a broken man pitifully begging for his mute mercy. If there ever is a measurable scale to the emotional spectrum of acting, then Mr. Choi's performance pushes through the untested limits of infrared and ultraviolet. His brilliantly inscrutable and ambiguously formed sweet-and-sour smile(Mona Lisa would be proud) near the end is the singular summation of a tortured soul who has just been reminded of the unbearable cost of his hollow victory. Perhaps it is the smile beneath which a glimpse of the ""monster"" can still be seen. Many will ponder.

Throughout the movie, the viewer is treated to some striking imagery which effectively appear almost embossed onto the film. Some of the more memorable scenes appear to be lifted right out of its dramatic Manga frame composition. Dramatic pose of our protagonist holding back the man and his dog, Mr. Han's momentarily frozen Judo form, the ""Great Wave""(poster) of emotion towering over Dae Su.. There is no stylistic over-byte here, just enough dramatic essence distillation to stick. Simply brilliant. Of course, this is in sharp contrast to the infamous hallway fight scene, an all out, no cuts, make-your-palm-sweat realism. This is largely due to Mr. Park's mastery of his directorial craft to match the subject drama and acting.

Those cineastes who like their cinematic Martini ""shaken AND stirred"" will no doubt discover a winding, twisted emotional vista, one that we rarely see. A rock and a grain of sand may sink the same, but surely this cinematic de la creme will ascend to its rightful notice. Indeed a stylistic substance and substantial style.",9.0,25 January 2005
An Asian American History X,"This movie is hyped and usually i don't like movies that are not American, I hate the fact that you don't understand what the actors are saying and therefore don't have that much empathy for them. I watched this movie to see what all the hype was about and to prove myself right for thinking that Asian movies are stupid. So I wanted to notice all the bad things in this movie.

I was proved wrong, this movie is awesome, the directing and acting is some of the best I have ever seen and the story is UNIQUE. This movie is like American History X and Fight Club, but it does not suffer from Hollywood-syndrome and makes these to films look like kid movies.

You will never see anything like this movie anywhere else.",9.0,30 December 2009
"I couldn't believe my eyes, nor ears for that matter","That's how big an impact ""Oldboy"" made on me! The opening of the movie alone is perhaps the coolest opening I have ever seen because when that music started playing and the first scene starts rolling I was in movie heaven. It was one of those perfect moments I guess, and it was all the much harder to believe, because I am no Asian-movie fan. Actually I avoid Asian movies as much as I can because I don't like their storytelling and directing, plus I never remember the faces because they all look the same. I have, since seeing ""Oldboy"", changed my opinion on that. How could I not, the movie has more style that the first two Matrix movies combined, visual effects that are more than equal rivals to any big-budget Hollywood movie, actors that I was somehow able to recognize were amazing, despite having to read the subtitles all the way through, and a music score that has been playing in my head for many days now. And I haven't even gotten to the true core of this movie. It's a story that blew me away, it's a hardcore revenge movie that won't leave you cold. Put all of this into exactly two hours of pure entertainment at it best, countless memorable scenes that are beyond amazing, and give it a dash of perfection. You got it, an instant cult classic. 9/10",9.0,26 August 2004
Grown up,"I haven't read the Manga (comic) this is based on, but I can tell you that the movie is very devastating. It also features things that might not be as apparent as they are, especially to western audience members. There is a different sense of honor and sensibility in general, something that is difficult to translate (more on that on my review for the US remake).

The lead role is played by great gusto, but the villain of the piece is great too. You can argue about motives all you want and about character decisions (see sensibility and how this movie ends), but it all works out nice. There are quite a few remarkable things happening (especially visually - think octopus and ""Hammer time"" to name a couple - but also tonally or story wise - one very big twist, that is as twisted as it gets) and some will take you by surprise. Unless you have read about them or seen the remake before this. Would be a shame, because if you only watch one Oldboy, make it this one!",10.0,13 June 2014
"Blind, driven, raging revenge!","Wow, I can't believe some crybaby removed my comment. What's wrong, does the 1st Amendment offend you? First, let me get this off my chest. A lot of people either love this movie or hate it with a passion. The ones who love it are the one's who choose to give something a chance, have an open mind, and already know the best stuff is being made outside the US. The ones who hate this movie well, never mind, it's not worth filling up this space. I did like this movie a lot. Liked it when I first got introduced to it in 2003 by friends in Korea and I still feel it holds up to most movies in its genre. The story in summary is explained by others who've posted review and synopses of the plot so go there to read it but to compare this to Count of Monte Cristo is a bit dumb. Maybe if you stretched it you can see the comparison but come on, seriously? Fans of go-for-broke revenge plots in the vein of Seven will love this movie as it is the closest thing to it. Certainly it has some plot elements that are going to make American audiences squirm but it is a Korean movie not an American movie. Don't be detracted by the people who've given this such negative reviews. It's VERY raw and sometimes brutal but it is a revenge movie at its core. Also, I don't know what ""gore"" people are referring to in this movie as there is no gore. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is gore. Brutality yes, gore? Hardly. Tarantino wished he could have directed this movie, 'nuff said. This movie rightly deserves it's rating.",9.0,6 October 2008

Dark entertainment,"Absolutely brilliant in its first few scenes (and a damn good first hour), which set the tone for a wild ride and showcase director Park Chan-wook's impressive visual flair. The mystery of what's happening to this guy is intriguing, and as he himself tries to figure out, we get a very creative fight scene in the corridor (among lots of other things, cough, octopus). It's no wonder Tarantino liked this film so much, as its main theme is revenge, it goes for those big, squirm-inducing shock moments, and it's quite stylish. For me it fizzled a bit in the second half, as I saw more of the nemesis character and the story was revealed. Much as I tried to suspend disbelief (and not think too much about the misogyny), several big moments in the plot seemed contrived, and it seemed kind of messy, wanting focus. Still entertaining though, if you're in the mood for something dark.",7.0,6 March 2020
Be prepared,"Oh. My. God. If you ever thought a movie twisted the fabric of your mind as to what is and isn't possible in this modern world of cinema, watch Oldboy and I'm sure it will surpass all your previous notions. Chan-wook Park is a Korean director who specializes in incredible stylistic camera work and artistic cinematography within a carefully constructed narrative. Oldboy is the second film in his aptly named ""vengeance trilogy."" It is about a man who is imprisoned 15 years for unknown reasons. After enduring painful loneliness for all this time, he is released, only to find out he has five days to find out why he was imprisoned. It starts off strange and different, yet don't get discouraged. Everything echoes throughout the film to end with one of the most twisted and stunning climaxes I have ever witnessed. My jaw was left wide open for the last fifteen minutes of this movie, and then about ten more after the credits finished rolling. If it hadn't been so late I might have hit the play button again as soon as I made it back to the DVD menu. It was utterly mind blowing.

I was most definitely not prepared going into this film, but it only served to heighten the experience of watching this practically perfect film. Oldboy hits the ground running and within five minutes of the film we get an incredible taste for what Chan-wook Park's filmmaking is all about. It's fast. It's fun. But it's also smart. Amidst the vibrant colors and the beautiful cinematography there is an incredible narrative. As the mystery of this film unravels we are pulled farther and farther in. And of course at the end of the film it just explodes in our faces without hardly any warning. You will be amazed. You will be disturbed. It will most definitely catch you off guard. It was all so expertly done and I just couldn't avert my eyes for one second in fear of missing the mysterious grandeur of this film. Every moment and every character serves the plot to some avail. There isn't a moment in Oldboy that felt unnecessary or overdone. It's one of the brilliantly made films which comes full circle by the end, only wanting you to rewind and watch the whole thing over again, immediately. I can't come up with enough words to describe how awesome this story is. It is definitely one of those you absolutely must see for yourself.

I'm sure it's a ballsy statement to make, but Chan-wook Park could be the next Akira Kurosawa, only this time slightly more hardcore, obviously. Every shot of Oldboy is so incredibly crafted, down to the most finite detail. The entire film is handled with such care and precaution, and the results are astounding. There are moments in the film which resonate the style of other master directors. There are multiple shots in the film which are heavily Scorsese influenced, for example. However, there is still an extremely definitive style here which belongs to Park. This style is what prevails over any of the specific influences scattered throughout the film. If Park continues to make films like this he will most likely go down in history as one of the genius auteurs of the 21st century. However, on that same note I would be amazed if he ever made anything that could top Oldboy.

Oldboy is one of those films which you will never be able to get out of your head. Whether this is a good or bad thing is up to you, but to me it was a great thing. It's a one of a kind film which could never recreated in it's full glorious essence. There was once talk of an American remake of this film, and I'm not sure I could have stomached that, knowing for a fact that any American team could never top the demented perfection of the original. Oldboy is utterly incredible. Every moment is perfect. It gets everything right and goes farther than you could ever imagine. The best part is that Oldboy doesn't fall into one specific genre of film, making it an example of how practically any film should be made, in essence. It would be a crime to go through life never seeing this film.",10.0,7 October 2010
an unusual yet mesmerizing revenge fable,"I will admit right off that bat that I'm not a fan of the whole ""Asian Extreme"" phenomenon sweeping across North America right now; as far as horror goes, my heart is grounded in the Spaghetti Splatter of Fulci and Argento; as for revenge, Charles Bronson always ""makes the bloodlust grow fonder."" ""Oldboy"" takes a bit from both: a man is imprisoned for 15 years without any apparent purpose, and vainly attempts to break free of his shackles; once he does, he seeks out those who put him there, and embarks on a stylized--yet strangely 'civilized'--killing spree. For much of its running time, my reaction to ""Oldboy"" was a stupefied ""huh?"" It has a plot as excessively complicated as a '70s giallo, and often drifts quite far from reality (not really griping, as it provides the film with a disorienting, surreal sheen), but is simply mesmerizing. From the standpoint of visuals and camera work alone, ""Oldboy"" is as beautiful to look at as Dario Argento's ""Deep Red."" However, like Argento, the characters are less prone to expressing their feelings outside the requirements of the plot, and while there is a striking humanity underneath the bloodshed of ""Oldboy""--it simply isn't enough to elevate it above its own obsession with surface quality. Too bad, seeing as how the potential for greatness is certainly present.

Repugnant and meaningless,"After having suffered through the major part of this film, I finally stood up and walked out of the theater. And mark my words, that's the first time I did that. With that not said that it's the worst film I've ever seen at the cinemas, but first there are the regular bad films and then there are the films that really overwhelm you in their surprising amount of empty meaninglessness. I was apparently misled by the great praise this movie has been given here in Sweden by reviewers that I normally trust, not to mention the award in Cannes.

The film does not work at any level, with a possible exception for the settings and the suggestive coloring. All I could see was a repugnant protagonist that stumbles from one out-of-place and pointless scene to another, maybe he was out to have his revenge on somebody, or maybe was he just adding to the confused and weak script with his own confusing actions, it does'nt really matter since the film did'nt really communicate anything substantial at all.",3.0,8 February 2005

"""Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep and you weep alone.""","I finally re-watched this masterpiece from Park Chan-wook. When it comes to movies about revenge, I have never seen something as effectively shocking as this was. It made me remember why I was so shaken up by this movie the first time I watched it. Nothing can truly prepare you for the kind of deranged story that unfolds in front you.

The plot is about Oh Dae-su, a man who is kidnapped and confined to a prison where, with his only form of contact with the outside world being a television where you see someone of the worlds biggest events he missed out on. He also finds out that his wife is murdered and he is framed for it, leaving his daughter orphaned. He is mysteriously released by his captors after 15 years. He is left unaware who did it, why he did it or why he was released. While his life is consumed with revenge, he also falls in love with a young woman who works in a sushi restaurant. When it comes to extreme violence, this is one of those films where I found a lot of it deeply affecting to the point where I was just completely taken out of my comfort zone the first time I watched it. It is razor sharp in terms of its storytelling and it feels so rich because for all the twisted insanity that involves in front of you, it feels impactful in all the right ways. All of the characters, no matter who they are feel like their motivations are handled properly. Oldboy becomes a better movie with every scene, because every plot point that's revealed to you, it is just consistently riveting and I was noticing a few subtle new things on repeat viewings.

All of the performances are superb in this and I feel I would have to spoil things if I was talking about everyone, however I will say that I absolutely adored Choi Min-Sik's performance as Oh Dae-su. Everything is revealed to you from his perspective and everything about his performance feels real and believable. He has that wonderful mix where he is just completely deranged and bad ass, while also having down-to-earth vulnerabilities and weaknesses and this makes him easy to connect with as a viewer. It makes everything revealed to you feel so much more meaningful.

His fight scenes.... wow! Just wow! How can something so messed up look so beautiful? The famous hallway scene one of best fight scenes I have ever seen put to film and it is just staggering to me how perfect it looks. It's not so much the martial arts that looks impressive, it's the fact that the film isn't afraid to make the fighting a little raw and sloppy at times which makes for a visceral and painful looking scene. Seeing Oh Dae-su with a switchblade stuck in his back for most of the scene just has me grimacing. And to top of that it is filmed in a beautiful extended long tracking shot. As badass as he is in this film Choi Min-Sik also gives a wonderful physical performance and he looks like he is in pain.... a lot. He sells a character who only has one thing left to fight for in his life and that is revenge and you feel his desperation for it.

The music in this film is just beautiful. The use of Vivaldi's 4 Seasons to someone's teeth getting pulled is so indescribably twisted, I just love it! That piece will probably haunt me whenever I go to the dentist now. The rest of the soundtrack is so beautiful it almost brings me to tears listening to it by itself. Jo Yeoung- wook and Shim Hyun-Jung's classical score feels very contrasting to the visuals, and just feels so tragic and melancholic. The last track called The Last Waltz, is one of the most beautiful pieces in the film and just has me deep in thought as I'm meditating and processing everything that has just happened in the film.

I also appreciate how you get a few darkly funny moments in there as well. There's one scene early on, while Oh Dae-su is still held prisoner, where he decides to write a list of people who he think might be motivated enough to do something like that to him and he ends up filling up an entire journal of it. There's a few little moments like that where you see humour like that just sprinkled in and I love that. I simply have to see more films from Park Chan-wook, because in my opinion he is one of the best filmmakers of all time. It's both beautiful and brutal to watch at the same and it's just one of those films that held my attention from start to finish. It is such a riveting experience, that the 2 hours just fly by and it's shocking ending makes the film linger on long after it's over. It's a great story where you end up buying into every characters motivations no matter how you look at it and that's what makes Oldboy a truly special experience. I loved every minute of this.",10.0,13 August 2017
Thank you IMDb people!!,"Yes a shout to all people who reads and posts or votes on IMDb. Because you guys make sure I get to watch movies that are awesome. If it wasn't for IMDb I would have probably missed out on many,many and many more movies, including: Oldboy.

When it comes to foreign films I used to be very skeptical. Why? Well most movies I watched when I was young where from Hollywood. But once you really 'open your eyes' you'll see that there are so many great movies not from the movie-factory;Hollywood. like: The Green Butchers, Adam's apples, Oorlogswinter, Grave of the fireflies, Spirited away and not sure but the kite runner. Anyway I think I could make a bigger list but then I wouldn't have time or enough lines to talk about Oldboy.

Oldboy starts of very funny. It doesn't really fit the rest of the film but its a great starter. Then it does seem to change drastically. I won't go in detail since I don't want to spoil anything. But every movie has a certain feel to it. The way you feel, like a taste on your tongue, keeps you entertained or not, simple as that. This movie has a very unique feel to it which I haven't seen or felt before. You get really attached to the main character which makes you put aside your own feelings of 'right and wrong' and condone fighting/killing etc.

This movie has everything you would expect from a movie. complicated characters but understandable, a unique storyline, love in a special way and twists and turns. But this movie shall never reach the top, as in a score 9+. Why? Because its not a movie every person would want to watch. Some scenes are very ...'special'.

Conclusion: Unique movie that is awesome in many many ways but not one to watch with friends or family that wouldn't understand these kind of movies.",9.0,26 June 2010
A Moral Immorality: Tale of a Monster,"Oldboy is a puzzling masterpiece that deeply submerges viewers in a jaw-breaking tale of revenge, redemption, and the intricate interplay of human morality. Rooted in the depths of moral psychology, the film takes its audience on a hair raising though agonizing journey that scrutinizes the complexities of ethical decision-making, the consequences of our actions, and the blurred lines between right and wrong or morality and immorality.

The film narrates an excruciating exploration of the aftereffects of vengeance. The protagonist, Oh Dae-su, becomes a pawn in a twisted game of retribution, setting off a chain of events that challenge the very fabric of his moral compass. As the narrative unfolds, the audience is hardly slapped with the question: Can the pursuit of revenge ever be morally justified? The film provides no easy answers, prompting viewers to grapple with the intricate nuances of justice and the ethical implications of one's desires.

In fact, Old Boy presents moral psychology through the characters' motivations and actions. Oh Dae-su's relentless quest for retribution leaves us no choice but to question the limits of empathy and compassion. His single-minded pursuit shows the darker aspects of human nature, revealing the depths to which an individual can descend when consumed by vengeance. This transformation is a testament to the instability of morality under extreme circumstances and the precariousness of our ethical foundations.

The apparently antagonist character of Lee Woo-jin, adds another layer of moral complexity. His calculated actions challenge conventional notions of right and wrong, pushing the boundaries of moral relativism. The film invites us to examine the rationale behind his elaborate scheme, blurring the line between villain and victim, and shedding light on the intricate motivations that drive his actions. Oldboy also raises the profound question of redemption. As the narrative reaches its climactic moments, the film explores whether individuals can truly atone for their past transgressions. Oh Dae-su's journey towards self-discovery becomes a poignant exploration of moral growth and the possibility of finding absolution, even in the face of unthinkable deeds.

Park Chan-wook's flawless direction and the performances of the cast create a hauntingly immersive experience, leaving audiences super shocked and contemplative long after the films ends. As we journey alongside Oh Dae-su through his odyssey of revenge, redemption, and moral reckoning, we are compelled to confront our own moral convictions, challenging us to reflect on the fragile and intricate nature of our ethical compasses.",10.0,18 August 2023
A Masterpiece,"This is by a noticeable margin, the best film I have ever seen. I am a film enthusiast rather than a serious critic, but despite never having written a review before I felt compelled to write this. Quite a few reviews of this film have given it a 1 out of 10. This is absurd, all such ratings can be dismissed as the nonsensical ramblings of those who claim to be enlightened but are nothing more than the sort of people who disagree with you just to sound intelligent.

At the end of this film I fell in love with it, the deliberately flawed characters, the eclectic directing, the soundtrack, everything. The romance is neither naive nor cynical, the action is realistic (even capturing the occasional absurdity of fighting) and the characters are some of the best written I have ever seen (Oh Dae Su can be compared to a Shakespearian antagonist).

You need to watch this film, it will chance your perception of everything for the better.",10.0,6 July 2012
A movie that goes further than your usual revenge story.,"I recently watched Oldboy for the first time, and I can already say that it's one of the best films I've seen. Instead of being your average revenge film, this film focuses on the consequences of revenge over the act itself. The action is amazing, especially the hallway scene, which might've inspired Daredevil's season 1 sequence quite a bit. The story is twisted and horrific, but I wouldn't have it any other way. This is just an amazing movie overall, and if you think you can handle more than what Hollywood films usually contain, you're in for a ride.",,23 June 2022

Takashi Miike meets Wong Kar Wai,"When i first saw Oldboy back in 2004, i was just 13 years old. I watched it with my girlfriend at the cinemas just couple of hours after watching Alfonso Cuaron's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I didn't enjoy it that much, but the film does make my girlfriend cry. However, i do like the dialog between Daesu and Woojin, as well as the corridor fight scene.

Three years later Oldboy came back to the spotlight. During the recent shootings at the Virginia Tech Institute, Fox News and Sky News claimed that Oldboy inspired the killer Cho Seng Hui to commit crimes. I wasn't much convinced by the news reports, and so i picked up a DVD of Oldboy at the store and try to link this film with the shooter. Because if i remember, this film doesn't have the GTA-style violence that will encourage people to commit violence.

Unfortunately, i was right. This film is not that GTA violent at all. And it has only one gun shown at the film. However the good part is that it made me love the film more. Why? Because it made me appreciate the story, the feel, the romance and the tragedy of the film. I'm not really used to Korean cinema, but this film just blew me away.

The story of this film tells about Oh Daesu, a man who was sent to the police station on the day of his daughter's birthday. He was bailed by his friend Joo Hwan. However, just as he was to apologize to his daughter on the payphone, he was kidnapped, and was sent to a room with nothing but a television, a toilet and a bed for 15 years.

After 15 years, he escaped. He became unfamiliar with the outside world that he hasn't knew for a long time. During the time he was in that room, his only link with the outside world was the television. And he became familiarized with computers and cell phones, thanks to television.

However, his world changed. He was accused of murdering his wife while on that room, and his daughter was sent to Sweden. Desperate to know why he was imprisoned for 15 years, he sets out for revenge, hoping to look for the man responsible for imprisoning him in that room.

What i like about this film is that it has the brilliance mix of Scorcese combined with a Tarantino-ish dialog and some neo-noir backgrounds. Even if it's not an English film, but it is a film that will appeal to many. The directing was probably the most brilliant piece of artwork you'll see in a film. One scene has Daesu fighting a group of thugs in a corridor, and that scene is taken with one shot, which makes the whole scene look like a painting.

So is this film good? Of course it is. Sure there's some sex and nudity, and you'll need to read subtitles to enjoy this film, but the violence? Not that heavy. It's just only teeth removal, tongue cutting and a fight scene between a man and 30 gangsters. It shouldn't be blamed for matters like Virginia Tech shootings. However, if you're looking for a deep & thought-provoking film with touches of Tarantino & Scorcese in it, then look no further than Oldboy.",9.0,29 April 2007

"One Of The Most Original And Compelling Films Ever Made. ""Oldboy"" Blew Me Away","I personally feel Oldboy is the best film to come out of Asian cinema, it really hit me hard. I loved it from start to finish, this dark tale of revenge is one of the most unique experiences I've ever had. Everything about Oldboy is perfect, the direction, the poetic screenplay, the haunting operatic score and the wonderful acting. Even though Oldboy is a tale of revenge, it has an underlying message of redemption.

I mean how can you feel sorry for someone when you don't know what they have done. You see Oldboy questions the viewer, you will falter between feeling sorry for someone and then wondering ""But what did they do to make that person do such a thing?"" The film tests what many viewers can handle, even though the film is disturbing it adds a touch of twisted humour. Chan-wook Park is a director with a lot of talent, he mixes genres perfectly and many different techniques used to create a dark foreboding atmosphere.

The dialogue is poetic, deep and meaningful. The phrase ""Laugh, and the world laughs with you, weep, and you weep alone"" is a very true statement. It's the kind of dialogue where you want to sit back and think about it for a second because everything moves with great pacing. The movie is deep and fulfilling. It holds many surprise twists and turns and uses some great shock techniques.

The film mixes genres together, mainly using revenge and drama. The movie studies humanity and how a person can hurt someone without realising it. I would say this masterpiece is very psychological because it tests the viewers boundaries of what they can handle in certain places. The movie has a very comic book feel to it because it's based of a Manga series as well as being part of the ""Vengance Trilogy"". The movie helps define the often used term of ""cool"".

Oldboy stands high up in a class of it's own, the movie is visual beauty and shows the pain that the characters are going through. The edging menace that weaves it's way throughout the film manages to keep the viewer watching and grasping for more. Oldboy is a film that sticks with you and plays on your mind for a long time after each viewing. The movie is very deep and manages to show things through ""In your face"" technique and subtle imagery through acting. Another genius aspect would be the way you can't really decide who's the bad person is, there are definitely no good characters apart from Dae-su Oh's lover who acts powerfully and with lots of precision.

For example one of the great scenes in this masterpiece is the love scene, it shows all the pain Dae-su Oh is going through. The actor Min-sik Choi has been casted perfectly and plays his role as Dae-su Oh with sublime brilliance. The direction is stylish and different, the movie experiments with very clever camera techniques. An example would be the close up of Dae-su Oh in the right hand corner of the screen and the blurred image of someone behind him. Oldboy is an extremely intelligent style of film making that is for a viewer who wants to get something out of the movie they are watching.

The movie is somewhat like a Film-Noir, the narration adds depth and powerhouse style to the films undertone. Hence the idea of revenge and telling the tale of something that asks the viewer questions. The movie plays with the mind and twists everything you once thought was correct. The viewer never knows who to trust or what is going to happen next. he movie is unpredictable and feels like a poem of death. The first 40 minutes or so build up a claustrophobic atmosphere. The film shows how our society and class we live in is fuelled by evil.

The movie is far from being at action movie and some might say far from being a revenge movie. It's more about lost love, self indulgence and finding inner tranquillity. The acting as mentioned is very powerful and provokes the viewer to ask the one main question that the film offers and that's ""Why?""

Another important aspect would be ""Insanity"" and ""What drives a human? What really makes them want to go out and do something?"" Some viewers will be put off from the films high-octane style and grace. But mainly the fact the movie is very twisted and disturbing. Though the added touch of satire adds a crazed ambition. The film actually feels quite Quentin Tarantino like in certain places or at least something that would appeal to his taste in film. The film is unflinching with it's camera use and what is being put fourth in front of the viewer.

Perfection, detail and sublime visual flare makes this one of the greatest films ever made. You'll be wanting to see Oldboy again and again as soon as it finishes. The movie is confusing and fulfilling with it's wonderfully sweeping plot line. There is no doubt about it, Oldboy is one of the greatest films of the 21st century.",9.0,9 July 2006
"A Non-Gratuitous, Well-Crafted Extreme Film","Oldboy is a fine movie. In reading some of the negative reviews on IMDb, however, one may be given the impression that this film is gratuitous in its use of violence and sex. Nothing could be further from the truth. Those who have seen this film understand that the sex scene was an important  even ESSENTIAL  event. (This is, mind you, the only movie I can think of that has been able to utilize sex as a significant contribution to a well-crafted storyline.) Thus, the sex was not gratuitous at all, since it served a purpose that becomes all the more obvious as the story progresses. If one wishes to see gratuitous sexual content that adds virtually nothing to a horribly-crafted storyline, one can refer to Izo (directed by Takashi Miike).

With regards to those complaining about the film's believability, they are simply attacking a strawman. And I ponder at why these very same criticisms of believability are not applied to such overrated films like The Lord of the Rings or ET. Perhaps because the priority of such films are not in their presentation of believable concepts? In like manner, this film's purpose is to express the consequences implicit within the pursuit of vengeance. Whether or not the events therein are believable or not is inconsequential. Thus, the criticism of unbelievability is logically flawed, and pointless.

I have always held that making a film extreme  in and of itself  does not make a good movie. (And I have seen plenty of low quality extreme movies.) That said, there are both bad and good extreme films. With its engaging storyline and entertainment value, Oldboy is an unequivocal example of the latter.",10.0,11 April 2006
"A Brilliant, Artistically Accomplished Thriller","In Oldboy Choi Min-Shik (of Shiri fame) plays Dae-su, a man kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years in a single room apartment, before being released and given 5 days to discover the reason for his imprisonment. Okay, so you know the basic premise of this film. What is hard to convey is the sheer excellence of the performances in this film, or the artistically intriguing camera shots or even the absorbing nature of this intriguing thriller. Every scene looks stunning, the lighting and sets seem perfect from the drab prison walls that actually make you feel ill, to the cold steel of the office building with its clean lines and vapid design. Great care and attention has been taken when planning this film, and it shows. Park Chan-Wook deserves much acclaim for his direction and sheer effort in bringing this film to screen. The plot is also intriguing yet not overly complex and the pace of the film is punctuated by scenes of extreme violence which are somewhat disturbing, but never gratuitous when balanced against the nature of the world Dae-su has descended into. But all of the sets and direction only gain cachet when placed next to the performances of the two main players; Choi Min-Shik (who is simply astounding in probably his best role to date) and Yu Ji-Tae (from the enjoyable Korean horror/thriller Into the Mirror). Both men put in staggering performances of particularly extreme characters without seeming too grandiose. This baroque thriller is simply not to be missed by any fan of thrillers or Asian cinema. Yet I would warn those who have issues with screen violence and somewhat disturbing subject matter to look elsewhere. But all in all, I hold this film up as a true masterpiece, and unquestionably one of the best thrillers to be made yet.",10.0,28 January 2005

"Looks impressive, but hammer on it and you'll find it's hollow.","This is a case of a movie where the director has lavished too much attention, too impressive cinematography, on a story that can't support it. Chan-Wook Park starts with an almost Hitchcock-like tale of a man abducted and held against his will by an enemy he could not see. It is rather moving to see his anger, confusion, and frustration come to the surface. Sometimes the intensity is broken by dark humor, the sort of comic ""relief"" that also serves to ratchet up the tension. And the sense of composition and style is first rate. It seems like it's sometimes a cross between Hitchcock and the Wachowski Brothers.

But they you start to see loose threads appear, and instead of tying them up, the climax just makes everything unravel. We know that the hero, Oh Dae-Su, has been the victim of some elaborate plot for revenge or sadism. But then we find out just how elaborate it is, how many things the villain would have had to have under his thumb to make them not be coincidences, how many times Oh Dae-Su had to make the wrong choice, and just as importantly, how many times he had to escape getting killed by dozens of thugs at the wrong moment. At this point, the movie stops being an assault on our sensibilities, and turns into an assault on the willing suspension of disbelief. There's a fine line between shock and schlock, the sort of violence that produces horror and the sort of violence that is so unbelievable it can only produce numbness or laughter. I can appreciate both, but Oldboy crosses the line into schlock at the end - and seemingly doesn't realize it. ""Laugh, and the world laughs with you?"" Maybe not, in this case...

When Hitchcock went for shocking, he could leave you thinking that the world is twisted and sick. Chan-Wook Park only succeeds in leaving you thinking his own imagination is twisted and sick. Not really the same sort of shock.",6.0,27 July 2007

"Fun, but ultimately flawed","I wasn't able to find the time to see Oldboy at the cinema despite the overwhelming praise it received on release, so I had to wait until today to see the DVD.

Looking at the voting results here the split between the usual ""love it"" or ""hate it"" responses are even more marked than usual and I've been looking forward to the DVD release so that I could make up my own mind. I'm a little disappointed to admit that I neither love or hate Oldboy.

Oldboy is not a bad film, but it didn't bowl me over as I'd been hoping - maybe the months of anticipation meant that my hopes were always going to be dashed.

The main problem with this movie is that it's just not very well explained. OK, that can be expected in the beginning where we are all as confused as Dae-su Oh, but too much of Oldboy is played out without the audience having much of an idea about what they're seeing.

The explanation, when it arrives after a brief period of simplistic detective work, is something of a disappointment and, frankly, seems fairly trivial compared to the effort expended on exacting revenge for it. Dae-su Oh had forgotten the incident himself, and I really couldn't blame him.

Overall, definitely worth watching for the great atmosphere and some nice set pieces, but a little underwhelming in the final analysis.",7.0,26 February 2005
"What passes for ""great cinema"" these days . . .","I have watched this movie with great hopes. I am a movie buff, I love Italian cinema - Fellini, Antonioni, Rosselini, de Sica -, but I'm also open to many other cultures with their works. As I really LOVE Korean food, I hoped I could say the same about the movie hailed as the Second Coming in some circles. It wasn't meant to be, so please spare me the senseless innuendos about anybody calling this bad movie a bad movie being anti-Asian or whatever. I am anti-being-robbed-of-my-hard-earned-money, yes.

Yes, I can see how for somebody ready to believe that an MTV video is the greatest (or the ""coolest"") music they've ever heard Oldboy can seem a ""masterpiece"". But that's really stretching the latter term far beyond a benevolent attitude toward pop culture, more likely toward a mindless ""anything goes"" attitude.

By the way, without giving any spoilers, the plot is not ""original"", ""stunning"", or whichever other inapt superlatives the easy-to-please crowd bestowed upon this half-wit of a movie. It's at most an inflation of unbelievable and at times downright stupid twists which make no sense and bring no elation, cathartic or otherwise, in the viewer doomed to be submitted to this ""masterpiece"".

10/10 brilliant story,"What an amazing ending, mind blowing, brilliant storytelling, this movie had it all!!!",,3 April 2020
Stylish thriller that falls apart at the end,"Interesting premise (man is locked away for 15 years by a mysterious organization and isn't told what he's done or how long he's going to be there), beautiful photography, good acting and a director with real flair combine to make a very good movie that could have been great if it didn't go off into outer space at the end.

The character Oh-Dae Su starts off as completely unsympathetic--a drunken, annoying, loud-mouthed, obnoxious jerk who's sitting in a police station after obviously having been arrested for drunk and disorderly. He's eventually released, but soon afterward finds himself locked in what at first appears to be a jail cell but turns out to be a fairly well-appointed room, complete with TV. However, he soon realizes that it's not any kind of government jail or prison; it's run by a mysterious private organization, and no one will tell him why he's there or for how long and, in fact, he never sees another human being in all the time he's there. What he does see is a news report on the TV that his wife has been killed, his daughter has been taken away and that he is the prime suspect in the murder, but he knows he didn't do it because he had been locked up in that room. It's not long before he begins to go crazy, trying to figure out why someone would go to the trouble of locking him up and framing him for his wife's murder. Eventually he escapes after having been locked in his ""cell"" for 15 years--or did he really ""escape""? The all-seeing, all-powerful organization seemingly knows not only his every move, but knows what he'll do before he does. He meets a beautiful young chef in a sushi restaurant and moves in with her--but is she what she seems to be? Things snowball from there, and the plot twists, turns and surprises will have you going. It's been mentioned by others that this is a ""nasty"" film, but it's really not. There are some brutal violent scenes, but the ""nastiness"" is much more of an atmospheric nature. Although beautifully shot and brightly lit, the tone of the film is dark and oppressive (a nice contrast) and parts of it will definitely have you on the edge of your seat.

However, the last half-hour or so of the movie went completely awry. I won't say exactly what happens for the sake of not spoiling the ending, but suffice it to say that it will most likely leave you shaking your head saying, ""What the hell is going on here?"" However, even taking into account the disappointing last part of the movie, the film itself is still worth a look. It has more pluses than minuses, the actress who plays Mi-Do is gorgeous (that always helps) and has several not particularly gratuitous sex scenes (that always helps even more) and it does give you a lot to think about. If it wasn't for the ending, I'd have given it a much better rating than I did. Check it out.",7.0,1 September 2008
Oldboy = Oh boy! Looking further than western cinema...,"Oldboy

Is a brilliantly directed thriller by Chan-wook Park. Its tells the story of a guy who has been kidnapped and then after 15 years imprisoned in a room is let free, however he instantly seeks revenge on the guy who put him there.

The story is excellent with a plot that shows depth and keeps you guessing right until the very last shot. The film starts strangely in a holding area at a police station and this is where we get to see the lead character 'Oh Dea-su'. Right from the off, you sense this person is an unstable character displaying very erratic behaviour. He talks a lot & changing from one emotion to the next in an instant, however we are lead to believe this is due to the fact he has been drinking when his friend comes to bail him out.

Once out of the station he stops to make a phone call home when he is taken. The next time we see him, he is in a room looking unclean and dazed. 15 years passes by with nothing but a TV for company. This is one of the most important parts of the film, which the director perfectly puts across to the audience, you do feel the isolation he feels, the torment of 15yrs, wondering why he is there, when is he getting out, all these feelings / questions are asked by our lead.

When Oh Dea-su is free he befriends a young lady who has taken such a liking to him she enters into his world, helping him find the man he want to seek revenge upon. Once he comes face to face with his enemy, all is not what it seems, as he tells our lead revenge cannot occur as you will always be left wondering why he imprisoned him so the reason must be uncovered and then the two will meet again.

The film has so much on offer, some will point to the fact it might be too unrealistic yet you will not care for such a statement as the acting is great. Every actor portraying each role in a very realistic manner and thus you can really feel for each one individually on the same level. The director includes a wonderfully shot fight scene, where numerous men take on Oh Dea-Su in battle allowing for us to watch as if the side of the house has been cut open for viewing! When we follow our lead into his journey of discovery, there are disturbing parts of the film which are done tastefully and not over exposed.

Although there is a memorable scene which is not so tasteful (or tasteful for our lead!) which will leave people squirming even the non-squeamish but had to be shown in this manner in order to be credible to the character. Flashbacks are used to show past events inside the mind of the characters which for some people is off putting but for me helps gather a sense of what really happened rather than relying on verbal two-ing and throwing. There is symbolism included in many shots and the director likes to revert back to earlier dialogue which wraps the story up delightfully.

Overall Oldboy is world cinema at its highest quality. A colourful piece of cinematography from a notable director which I believe will no doubt see a Hollywood remake. If this does occur the only director I can see doing Oldboy justice is Quentin Tarantino. There are some people who will walk away from this film stating it was good but not amazing, however what I hope the majority will take away from Oldboy is a greater sense of appreciation for Eastern society film making.",10.0,27 May 2011
Pretty good but slightly overrated,"Before seeing Oldboy, I had heard a lot of good things about it. Many of my friends loved it and many respectable critics also praised the movie. The fact that it won prestigious awards from numerous festivals doesn't hurt either. However, this film seems to be the kind of ""hate it or love it"" type of film. Even in IMDb.com, many people believed this is one of the greatest films coming out of Korean while others said it sucks.

For me, after seeing it, I feel that it is a pretty good movie, visually stunning with sharp script and dialogs. All the actors did good jobs on their parts. Choi Min-Sik gave us a good performance as Dae-Su and so did Yu Ji-tae as Woo-Jin. The chemistry between these two is so good that we can feel the intense between them. However, as smart as the script is, the film suffers from the over-dramatized ending, typical for Korean movies (IMHO only). It seems like after a superb first 90 minutes of the film or so, the director tried too hard to impress us with the ending. The last scene between Dae-Su and Woo-Jin is totally too intentional and over-dramatic; I was disgusted. For me, it is sad because the film, a little after its first half, was on its way to be the best movie from Korean in my list. The ending, however, ruined it all; it's like after eating half a bowl of delicious soup, you find out that there is a pubic hair in it.

Anyway, it's not a bad movie, by all means. Kudos to Choi Min-Sik for his great performance in the first half of the film; he really put a lot of effort to it. Park Chan-Wook, the director, is, well, still Park Chan-Wook; great potential but never fully materialize his greatness. I'll look forward to his next film if he can really make it next time.",7.0,10 November 2005

When you find out the truth at the end, you will feel very sick, I promise you. I don't know why this movie tried so hard to mimic Japanese movies.

"A dark and uncompromising tale that seeks to prove that when seeking vengeance, you should dig at least two graves.","Vengeance - whether it be cold, calculating and entirely unnecessary or passionate, angry and ultimately fruitless - is depicted as an all-encompassing, life-ruining reflection of one's own inner emotions in this disturbing South Korean revenge thriller that pulls no punches and is vehement in its core ideology that when seeking retribution, you must first dig two graves. No-one escapes unscathed in 'Oldboy (2003)' and the so-called 'crimes' for which penance is being sought are so petty that when they're revealed you realise that the villain's motivations were actually to simply avoid placing the guilt upon himself (the only reasonable party). When the film reaches its heart-breaking, tragic finale it will leave you as devastated as the protagonist, before it all ends on one of the most deceivingly dark notes of the last few years. Yet, besides the fantastically well thought-out plot that's told with some brilliantly intelligent writing, the feature also relies on it's stand-out powerhouse performances and unflinching violence that, while certainly not as graphic as its reputation would have you believe, serves the dark and uncompromising story well.

Vertigo,"No movie stands alone. When we watch it, we bring all sorts of expectations to it, and a large part of that is the genre we expect. If we expect style, we are particularly acute in how we judge that factor, for instance.

In fact, we've come to rely on how a film announces itself. What I find interesting about this one is that it deliberately subverts any expectations we might have along these lines.

For example, most viewers will consider this a ""revenge"" movie, a very specific subgenre, and judge it on those merits. The problem is that the filmmaker goes out of his way early in the game to announce that these fellows are correct in their assumptions.

He then pulls the rug out from under those simple viewers, just as he does the hero. That's the art here, and you'll have to judge just how important it is to you.

I've become aware in the last few years how important the entry into a film is. The biggest, most shocking thing a filmmaker does is take us to another world. There are two big jumps he or she needs to make. The first jump is in the first few minutes, where the nature of the work is presented. If the movie is a strict genre film, this is easy because we have so many shorthand designators. Music is important.

The second big step has to do with the first plot point. In this case, the episode tells us that the hero (our surrogate) sees only what is intended. His perception is bent, manipulated. His TeeVee is our movie.

I registered this against films that weave stories about how stories are woven. The touchstone of course is ""Vertigo,"" where two forces or beings on screen struggle to create a ""movie"" in front of us, each one trying to define a false future that merges with the similar future of the movie we watch.

""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" ""Open Your Eyes,"" even ""Tampopo"" are examples of this notion of storytelling, one that is intelligent and engaging. We have three entities as creators here. We have the guy we think is the master creator, Park, who we see borrows images as if he were in a drugged dream and can dream only in terms that he saw before he was locked up and gassed.

We have the supposed master manipulator, who hypnotizes, drugs, confines, bribes, and uses force and technology to make things turn out precisely the way he wants. Precisely, with no misstep whatever. Nominally he is the one creating the reality we see, but his manipulation is more perfect than that even of Park, so we know he is suspect.

And then we have the fellow that seems to be the puppet. But is he? He is the one that writes. Such comprehensive notebooks or diaries are common code in movies for something we enter. He is the one who dreams, for whom the images on TeeVee become a fantasy life replacing the ""real"" one.

He is the one with the interesting hallucinations that start with the purely hallucinogenic notion of exiting from a truck onto a grassy rooftop. He is the one who eats life, and in fact traces his roots back to the manipulator by surveying restaurants.

That business about snow and lost tongue and erased memory at the end. Shouldn't that tell us who imagined or created what we see? This idea originated in ""2001,"" where Kubrick played with the notion of who was narrating what we see: is it man, computer or deity? See this. Register it so that you can enjoy it.

Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,17 February 2006
a nice experiment in film but ultimately too contrived to be great,"Old boy is not a realistic film. Its characters are cut outs from some hyper thriller genre. Its plot twists are obvious devices to move the story along. And if these things mentioned are not important to you than it is likely you will be entertained by everything else; the camera trickery, the shocking torture scenes, and the comic book inspired story.

Old boy is a film made in a Hollywood vein. It is more sensational than anything else. In order to move the characters along Park has placed devices (deus ex machina) with the use of planted cell phones, surprises in boxes, uncovering things the viewer nor the main character, Oh Dae-su, had known. Is this a bad device? No. Its a common device used in many films. Could the story work without these devices? No. And because of this Oldboy works in the thriller genre. Yet Oldboy doesn't surpass any kind of film conventions in this in this genre to receive special praise.

The torture scenes are used more to shock than to tell anything new in the story. An example of a film where torture, very graphic torture, is not some cliché shock device but more so a comment on human relationships, pain, societal indifference, is Takashi Miike's film, Audition.

Lets not be so hasty in disregarding this film as bad, because bad it is not. It has moments. The opening is definitely an attention grabber - a guy holding a poodle being held by his tie from a building rooftop by some dark faced figure, Oh Dae-su's pleading, after finding out the biggest secret (plot twist), where he performs a disturbing masochistic act, and of course the one long take of the fight scene where Dae-su beats up some forty people. All that is cool. And the film throughout was cool, maybe mostly cool for cool's sake, until the end.

So if you're looking for entertainment with torture, blood, sex, fighting, topped with a comic like story of revenge, this film will definitely work for you. And if you are profoundly moved by the genius of this film, I'll be very suspicious. ALl in all, 7 out of 10.",7.0,16 May 2006
"15 Years Of Imprisonment, Five Days Of Vengeance...A Korean Masterpiece!!","Oldboy (Oldeuboi) is the second installment of the 'Vengeance trilogy' directed by Chan-wook Park and is by far the best of the three.

The first time I watched Oldboy it blew me away. Dark, slick, gritty and twisted, revenge has never been portrayed sweeter. I fell in love with the film instantly, I became gripped to my TV within the first five minutes. It kicks off right from the beginning and unlike some other films you don't have to wait half an hour to get interested. It seems quite straight forward a man (Oh Dae-su played by Choi Min-sik) is suddenly kidnapped and is imprisoned for 15 years without explanation and one day he is suddenly released. Now the protagonist is on the hunt for the man who's behind his imprisonment to get his revenge, however the story is more complex and gripping than that.

Like me most people would probably assume that the film will go on and in the end the villain will be revealed however Oldboy is quite unique. After Oh Dae-su is released his captor Woo-Jin (Yoo Ji-tae) one day reveals himself. Oh Dae-su instant reaction is to kill this man however Woo-Jin tells him that if he kills him he won't ever find out his motives behind his imprisonment. Woo-Jin then tells Oh Dae-su to discover his motives within the next five days or else he will kill Mi- do (Kang-Hye Jeong) a young sushi chef who Oh Dae-su meets at the restaurant she works at after he got released, she becomes Oh Dae-su's love interest. If Oh Dae-su succeeds in finding out Woo-Jin's motive then Woo-Jin will kill himself. With the captor revealing himself begins the protagonist's desperate journey to find out why he was kept in a room for 15 years, which leads him to dig in his past. This makes the story so intense and entertaining.

Oldboy is more than just revenge, blood and the typical overdose of violence it has a very intriguing plot portrayed very sleekly. For people that don't have a strong stomach it will disturb and disgust you(still watch it), some scenes will make your jaw drop, other scenes will make you speechless. There is nothing quite like Oldboy, it has all the correct ingredients. Chan-wook Park filmed every scene as if it's a piece of art; so stylish, bold and dark it seems as if we was to watch and feel the emotions of Oh Dae-su throughout the film. There's some amazing soundtrack and even better dialogue, everything just fits perfectly.

Choi Min-sik's portrayal of Oh Dae-su is one of the best performances I have ever seen. It's gripping and mesmerising, it sticks with you no matter however many times you watch it, such a powerful and striking performance. I've never seen anyone get in to the role and portray anger in such a breath taking way as well as Choi Min-sik. Yoo Ji-tae and Kang-Hye Jeong also gave outstanding performances.

For the people who haven't watched Oldboy I encourage you to watch it ASAP, it's a must see. I guarantee that you will not leave your seats, it's that entertaining. This film takes cinema to a whole new level, it breaks every barrier in ever aspect whether it's direction, acting, cinematography or background score. Oldboy has changed my outlook of cinema and after watching it everything else seemed mainstreamed to me; that's how much of an impact Oldboy has on me. I've lost count of the amount of times I've watched Oldboy, even though I know what will happen next, I was still gripped and entertained. Oldboy is in my top 5 all time favorite movies and I don't think any movie will be able to take it's place.

A little overrated,"I decided to watch this movie after hearing so much positive about this movie but after watching the movie, I think that this movie is little bit overrated.

The story was good with good thrill and suspense throughout the movie. The screenplay was little bit uneven, the direction was good and the performances were good. The main problem I faced with the movie was it's pacing. The pacing was uneven making movie dull at some points. Also, I think ghe movie is little bit overrated. Though, it is good but it doesn't have anything great or special in it.

Overall, you can give this movie a try if you want to.",7.0,5 September 2023

I am in shock,"I decided to watch Oldboy to learn more about my Korean heritage, as it is one of Korea's most renowned films. From the beginning, I was captivated by the action and darkness of the Oldboy. I am in shock because Oldboy is currently one of two films that I have realized that everything in the film is done for a reason; there is a cause for every scene, no matter how seemingly unnecessary, that the director will show later in the movie. The other film is Deer Hunter.

Despite being a film from 15 years ago, Oldboy is more intriguing than the comic book and action films of today, because of its unique fighting scenes and plot line. I was pleasantly surprised that the film totally unlike typical Korean dramas, totally shifting my perception of Korean cinema.",9.0,26 February 2018

Totally absorbing...........one of the best films I've seen in a long time,"I watched this film without really knowing anything about it - I just read the IMDb quick summary on what it was about - and seeing it praised so highly and a colleague of mine saying to watch it and it is a must see - I buckled down on it on a Friday night.

I was expecting this to be some sort of typical revenge film but with a deep meaning - why would it be rated so highly then? The good thing about the film is that it doesn't give you answers straight away and does a terrific job of keeping you engaged all the way through. You get to know the main character who has gone through years of torment for some unknown reasos as you experience his pain as Oh dae Su (Choi Min Sik) becomes a tormented man in his struggle for vengeance.

All I can say is that this film takes you down some paths that you think at one point - 'oh no they really are falling for clichés' but then it goes down something darker and you are totally blown away by what the conclusion is. I am usually a sucker when it comes to finding out twists as I can barely spot them but let me say the twist in this one I did not suspect one bit and was shocked by what I saw.

This is a unique film - the acting is perfect, the idea is clever and the emotions portrayed in the characters all exhibit human traits of being torn inside while still alive and just the whacky thing we can do to people to get our peace of mind if only temporarily.

All I can say is that you must see this film and it is a film I will be recommending to everyone to see.",10.0,28 October 2011
"Never has someone's action and another's reaction sparked endless chains of ""action-reaction"" events that are so devastatingly depicted in a motion picture before.","Critically-lauded and an audience favorite, Oldboy is arguably Park Chan-wook's best film to date, and one of the key works of contemporary Korean cinema. Winning the Jury Prize at Cannes, Oldboy lets fly an intoxicating sense of atmosphere, an otherworldly, surrealistic feeling that sucks the viewer into the ghoulish noir world Park has conceived. We are introduced to the lead character, Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), at the onset whose life story forms the core of Oldboy.

Park's objective treatment of Dae-su is clever. The latter appears to be relating his story to the audience but it seems he is just as confused as we are. Yet we are willing to listen to him, to empathize with his situation, and to follow him on his quest to dig for the truth. Now, Dae-su is quite a poor chap. He has been locked alone in a room by a captor for the last 15 years, and then out of a sudden he is released with only five days to unravel the mystery and find his captor.

Oldboy starts out as a promising mystery-thriller, then turns into a love story, and then becomes a mob-vengeance flick. And when the pieces seem to have fit the puzzle, Park pulls the rug under us with a stunning revelation that builds the film up to its tragic conclusion. It is difficult to pigeonhole Oldboy into one or two specific genres because it breaks the conventions of every associated genre, resulting in a film best left to be admired and appreciated according to its own terms.

Park is a very skilled filmmaker; he has created a signature visual style that is present in most of his works – a morbid coldness that gives viewers a sense of unease through odd color tones, unorthodox shots, and numbing violence that seem almost too nonchalant. While he could be accused of being overly indulgent in brutality in Thirst (2009), in Oldboy however, the violence makes complete sense.

A few of them remain etched in my mind. One, the tooth torture scene in all of its g(l)ory. Two, the tongue-cutting scene, which is more painful than it impliedly suggests. And lastly, the controversial scene that shows Dae-su eating a huge octopus alive after he is released from captivity. Now, you may wonder why Park goes to such an extreme extent to shoot these ghastly scenes of suffering. The reason is simple – causal action brings about consequential reaction.

As Park slowly reveals key plot points during the course of the film, it becomes clear that violence is not a means to an end itself (this is the nature of many ""torture porn"" films), but a meaningful part of a whole. Mi-do (Kang Hye-jeong), a young woman who works in a sushi bar, meets Dae-su and falls in love with him at an inopportune time at the crossroads of violence. When not seeking sexual solace in Mi-do, Dae-su would react (almost always violently) against his captives.

In perhaps Oldboy's most brilliant sequence (a nostalgic throwback to those Street Fighter video games), Park choreographs a long take showing Dae-su fending off hordes of knife-wielding, rod-swinging street gangsters as he makes his way along a dirty, dimly-lit corridor from left to right. Such is his determination to stay alive that even with a knife plunged into his back, he continues to punch his way through.

Misogynistic and cold-blooded, Oldboy is Park's vision of a world ravaged by tyranny, vengeance, misanthropy and masochism. Yet, he finds bizarre beauty in all of this ugliness. Based on a comic by Minegishi, Park's story is absorbing and consumes you whole. Never has someone's action and another's reaction sparked endless chains of ""action-reaction"" events that are so devastatingly depicted in a motion picture before. I could only offer my sympathies to the characters. Even then, I know that is not enough.

One of the best South Korean action films ever made.,"Some storylines are so timeless; they can't help to be made into something modern-thus becoming timeless in the process. Oldboy (2003) can easily draw comparisons to The Count of Monte Cristo in its structure but adds depth and layers to a wild ride that unfortunately could not be even closely matched in its American remake in 2013. As it stands, Oldboy is one of the pillars that shows how culturally significant South Korean cinema has been and how its predecessors like Parasite (2019) and Minari (2020) stood on its shoulders to achieve greatness.

Oldboy is a lot like Memento (2000) in that it demands a second viewing, often right after reaching the end credits. Many of the plot's twists and turns readjust the viewer's understanding of previous events-to the point where you'll have to watch it again with this new knowledge fresh in your mind, thus opening up a whole new experience to the film. Revenge is piled upon revenge, but the motivation of these characters is always clear, even if it is uncomfortable at times. Oldboy certainly doesn't pull its punches when it comes to sex or violence, but don't let that distract you from the engaging story.

In fact, I would hope that anyone who likes well-done action sequences will take the time to watch this movie. Without spoiling it, I can honestly say there is a moment with a hammer that is as hilarious as it is disturbing. And sure, it might be a bit over-the-top at times, but what action film doesn't land in this pitfall and still manage to entertain? Either way, by the end of the movie, both the characters and the audience are ultimately changed by what they just learned and saw, respectively.

One of the best South Korean action films ever made, I give Oldboy 5.0 stars out of 5.",10.0,17 May 2021
"Dark, stylish, engaging stuff that will appeal to modern audiences even if the lack of depth is a problem","Having been collected in a drunken state from the police station by his friend, Oh Dae-su vanishes from the street and awakes in a locked room. Months later he knows nothing more about why he is imprisoned and is brought food. A year later he has been framed for the murder of his wife but still is none the wiser why he has been imprisoned or by whom. Fifteen years pass by and Dae-su has spent most of them driven by rage an a desire to get free from his prison. A month from breaking though the wall he is gassed and dumped on a roof garden inside a suitcase.

Being, in essence, a wuss, I took my time getting round to watching this film and braced myself when channel 4 trailed it with warnings for brutal violence, torture, sexual scenes and ""a scene where a man eats a live octopus""  suffice to say I was ready that this film wasn't going to be Disney. That said there is a feel of graphic novel about this (I think this is where the material has come from) and for all its brutality there is a dark sense of humour running across it. The plot is engaging mainly due to the level of mystery in it and I was held unto the end. The conclusion is drawn out for a bit too long but it is still quite clever and satisfyingly downbeat. Viewers should brace themselves for a certain amount of lack of logic across the plot  this comes with the heavily stylised territory and doesn't damage the arch of the film that much.

It is of course violent; there is no disputing that, and I did have to look away from the screen on several occasions. The torture scenes and such are within a dark context though and I found it a lot less violent than some Hollywood films that draw pleasure from gore and death  here it is dark and unpleasant and rarely exciting. Park's direction is impressive and the film has a great fell to it with plenty of style and clever touches but not to the point where it dominates proceedings  the style is the polish, not the whole show. The cast work surprisingly well considering that the depth of the film and characters does rely heavily on the rather convoluted and unrealistic setup. Choi is a powerful heart to the film, starting as a flabby drunk, transforming with rage and hate to the point of looking totally different while also making other significant shifts. The film very much belongs to him but he is well supported throughout. With perhaps weaker characters to work with Kang is good as Mido while Yu turns in a compelling and sinister character without ever losing touch with what has been driving him all these years.

Overall then an impressively dark and compelling film. The violent scenes (and one intense scene of animal cruelty) will put many off, as will the fact that the film doesn't happen in a real world but regardless it is stylish, engaging and compelling.",,23 November 2006
Doesn't live up to the hype. I'd call it fantasy mystery,"Finally took a bit of time to watch this one and despite the rave reviews I can only say that I was disappointed. Although the premise was interesting, I found the storyline predictable and the production suffers from horrendous supporting actors throughout. The narrative, which attempts to deepen your understanding of the main character, felt very old and tired. Maybe I expect too much, but I felt that I'd heard some of these narrated character development lines in many other movies. I felt that the use of humor throughout, particularly during tense/emotional scenes made it hard for me believe in the characters' choices/actions. Many times I felt like this reduced the quality of what was trying to be communicated. All that said, expert cinematography and an engaging soundtrack music make the film worthwhile.",7.0,21 January 2023

One-Of-A-Kind Revenge Tale!,"Amélie's quirkiness, Tarantino's violence and gore, interesting characters, intriguing plot, profound philosophical questions, and insanely cool action sequences made this gut-wrenching revenge tale the most gripping, entertaining, and enthralling movie of its kind, except it's actually one of a kind!

Amid the gruesome scenes, and the brutal fight sequences, Oldboy has a very emotionally devastating story. Chan-wook Park could have easily leaned on nothing but the action and the gore to grab the viewers' attention from the beginning. Instead, he knew that if there is anything that can attract the attention of the audience, and make them invested in the protagonist as fast as possible, it would be a thoughtful moral philosophy mingled with a sentimental story. That's how Chan-wook Park captivated the viewers from the opening scene until he evoked a catharsis in the audience at the traumatic third act.

Flawless is a very weak, and unsatisfying word to describe the third act. It's simply look like nothing you've seen before, or even you'll see. With its twist reveal, to the outrageous and shocking visceral images, the third act is provocative, distressful, and utterly maddening. But nothing would have worked in it, and in the entire movie as a whole without Min-sik Choi's kinetic multi-layered performance.

The fact that this movie didn't get a single Oscar nod, at least for Min-sik Choi's incredible performance, is as infuriating as the movie itself. For me, Min-sik Choi delivered one of the best performances in the past decade. Yes, I would easily put his performance alongside Adrien Brody's in The Pianist, Leonardo DiCaprio in The Aviator, Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood, and Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. But all that thanks to Chan-wook Park who allowed Min-sik Choi to show all his talent challenging him, and his pathetic, Dae-su Oh.

What is truly impressive is how Chan-wook Park put us in Dae-su Oh's shoes by changing the tone, so gracefully, to resemble how the protagonist feels. The movie starts off with flashes of dark humor matching how mazed and lost the character feels. Then, when things become more clearer and clearer the tone becomes darker and darker till the climax when the movie became acutely distressing and dreary.

Nevertheless, these tonal changes didn't work very well at the second act. Not because the tonal shift wasn't smooth, nor it came abruptly, but because that was the time when our protagonist, as well as us, discovering clues, and collecting pieces to get the whole picture. The whole act was very convoluted, for better or worse, but the thing is that the pacing was madly rushed resembling Dae-su Oh's confusion and ignorance. Not to mention, there were some sequences where we get to know about some very important characters, and some specifics related to them. Adding insult to injury, some of these details could be passed up, because they are simply not that important. The result is that the movie almost lost me a couple of times. I mean that I really lose track of some small details.

Oldeuboi is a very powerful, thought-provoking, and visceral film, and that's because what it implies more than what it depicts. I think it's the first Korean film I watch, and it definitely won't be the last. Just help me with some recommendations, if you wouldn't mind! :)

"Smile and the world will smile with you, cry, and you will cry alone","Inspired by the manga manga, ""Oldboy"" impresses the West, as it deals with violence and revenge in a surprising way, showing that even the smallest acts have their weight.

Yoo Ji-tae has a sensational performance, it's that villain that makes us all hate him, that is, he fulfilled his role, Choi Min-sik impresses at times with his expression caricats and scandals, but he lacks a dramatic tone And Kang Hye-Jeong does not have a dramatic or humorous tone, but is beautiful and concentrates all the attention on screen, this is the film that consecrates the career of the great director - the most popular in Western culture - Park Chan-Wook.

Unmissable,"As controversial, violent (both physically and emotionally), relevant and unmissable as it has been pitched, Oldboy is one of those rare films that crawls under your skin while you're watching it and even more so once it's finished.

Dae-Su is kidnapped and held captive in a hotel bedroom-like prison until his release 15 years later. With absolutely no contact with the outside word, save for a TV set, he embarks on a quest for revenge and answers, while being regularly contacted by his captor teasing him with clues for his identity and the reason why he was held captive. Oldboy is a gut- punching tale of revenge, rage, frustration and anger riddled with mystery and an overabundance of twists and turns that despite borderline far-fetched, delivers an unmeasurable payoff.",9.0,29 December 2016
A masterpiece from South Korea,"Oldboy is a film that hit me like a sledge-hammer. It is a remarkable film about the dangers of how revenge can consume you. The characters are three-dimensional, authentic and entirely believable. Stylistically the film is absolutely gorgeous. There is so much detail in every single shot. There are enough twists and turns to keep viewers on the edges of their seats. It isn't a film for the faint- hearted, but I advise that you just buckle up and get ready for a wild ride. Sure there are a few plot-holes here and there, but as a whole, Oldboy is a charging bull of a film. It stops for no man. You just have to keep up.

A modern classic.,"Oldboy is a great film. Not only did it put South Korea on the cinematic map, it did so while delivering a great, psychological horror story, told with a completely fresh flair and style.

It is a violent film. The violence is over-the-top and shocking, with scenes of torture and bloodletting that are grotesque and wince-inducing. However, Oldboy has little in common with the stereotypical action or gore movie, in which the focus is on the violence itself rather than trivialities like plot, characters and themes. In such works, the events in the film function mostly as a tiresome haul that needs to be completed before the satisfying arrival at the blood-splattered money shot. Oldboy, on the other hand, smoothly weaves the violence into its story in a natural and unforced manner. Also, by refusing to shy away from the images of obscene violence, the film puts an uncomfortable magnifying glass over the ugly side of revenge. Showing the disturbing violence for what it is rather than glorifying it, it makes an impression that lasts far longer than that of Tarantino's shallow revenge fantasies.

After his previous work, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, director Park Chan-Wook went a whole new direction. While that film was slow-paced to the point of being meditative, and had stylistic touches but maintained a cold realism, Oldboy is fast and stylish and bursting at the seams with cinematic ideas. Film-wise it follows an anything-goes principle, and it does so without ever feeling silly or excessive. The unexpected use of CGI, unexpected violence, unexpected turns of the story – everything is designed to catch the first-time viewer off-guard. Yet despite this, the film flows beautifully and makes perfect sense.

The combination of music – everything from low-key electronic loops to intense Vivaldi pieces – and images is simply fantastic. Every shot is eye-catching, from the dark and crumbling slums of the city to the antagonist's sterile penthouse and the final scenes' snow-covered mountain tops. It is a film that is great both to look at and listen to. Even so, it avoids making Tarsem Singh's (director of The Cell and The Fall) mistake of letting the images be the entire film. Instead, Oldboy's story more than holds its own against the visuals and soundtrack. When the film's final revelation comes crashing down, it is as shocking to the audience as it is to the protagonist. This ""twist"" scene also has one of the movie's greatest, tensest build-ups; if only for this single moment, the movie is well worth watching.

Oldboy is an example of a filmmaker having a good vision, the means to make it a reality, and the dedication and talent to pull it off. Direction, story and actors work together so well, it makes creating something like this look easy. If you can handle the violence, you will find an extremely well-written, creative, dramatic, humorous, original and entertaining film, one that takes you for a cinematic roller-coaster ride in its truest sense. A must-see.",,1 February 2012

"Dark, Twisted and Brilliant!!","Before seeing this movie, I had come across Oldboy in a number of lists where it was mentioned as one of the most violent and disturbing films you will ever see. On that count, it does not disappoint. It is a chilling depiction of a man who has been imprisoned for 15 years without knowing the reason for this punishment. The performance of Chao Min Sik is absolutely phenomenal. By portraying Oh Dae-Su, he completely owns the role and shows the desperation and want for revenge effortlessly. This is not a film for the weak-hearted as it contains several scenes of graphic violence which can't be handled by everyone. A must-watch for all cinema-lovers, this one can definitely rival the best movies that have come out of Asia.

I am not a fan of that kind of filming. I think that the director tried hard to impress the audience and he made it. But, the real art is elsewhere ( Godfather, Once upon a time in America, Stalker, Breaking the waves... and so on ).

Please stop it with the references to Oedipus Rex, Beckett, Count of Monte Christo, Hitchcock or whatever. This is a C grade exploitation film, poorly cast, poorly directed, poorly shot, poorly edited, poorly everything. It is one small step better than another waste of film that came out a few years ago which I believe was called ""Audition"" I think by a guy named Miike Tadashi. (Too lazy to check now). The amount of attention that crap got blew me away. I remember when Japanese cinema used to be acclaimed for Ozu, Oshima, Kurosawa, Mizoguchi, Ichikawa, Teshigahara and others. Those were real filmmakers. Miike is nobody.

That's as far as Japan goes. Surely there must be some South Koreans who are doing better things than this Sickboy.

The only reason I give it a 2 instead of a 1 is because the very initial premise IS indeed interesting but is handled so incompetently and sophomorically that you might as well be watching a snuff film. In fact, if the octopus counts, it is somewhat of a snuff film. Just as violent and just as juvenile as Tarantino but without his (for lack of a better word) ""talent"".

Basically a completely vile and disgusting exercise that should be relegated to the cutout bin.",2.0,3 April 2006

It's not hard to tell, from the movie's poster, that it is going to be same thing. It isn't because i hate Spike Lee or something, it is because i don't believe the movie could be made to be as good as this one. I would also recommend knowing as little as possible about the story of the movie before watching it.

this is one of the best foreign language movies i have ever seen my entire life. the movie has a plot that is to die for and the last revelation would either amuse or give you a heart attack.

It is a combination of good performances, an excellent soundtrack, an impeccable photograph, etc, which results in a movie to remember, those that remain in our memory.

The Second film in Chan-Wook Park's Vengeance Trilogy, its the story of Oh Dae-Su who was kidnapped and kept in solitary confinement for 15 years, and after his release he goes on a bloody rampage to find out who captured him & why. What follows is a revenge saga which is so twisted & vile, & yet so humane & heartwrenching. The Director has his own visual style & so many amazing frames are present in the film with Great Soundtrack. There is a jaw dropping action scene in the middle which probably inspired Daredevil's Fight Scenes. Choi Min-Sik in the lead is utterly phenomenal.

Cruel and Unusual,"Cruel and unusual...

Please do not mistake the above phrase as a negative review of this film. It is anything but. The movie is cruel; unforgivably, unabashedly, brilliantly cruel. Mr. Park refuses to compromise his vision in the name of our innocence and he and this film should be commended for it. All too often films, especially of the Hollywood variety, forsake artistry for commercialism, the honesty of tragedy for the fuzziness of fairy tale endings, truth for dollars. The very ""unusual""ness of this film arises from its very cruelty. It is embarking on territory rarely treaded on by conventional American films.

A man is imprisoned for 15 years. He gets out. He seeks revenge. He seeks the truth. The question is not whom but why. This is the basic premise of the film. It is not a complicated plot, and many such revenge films with similar plots exist, yet somehow this film is completely and utterly on its own plane. Maybe it is in the way Mr. park sets the mood - every frame is hauntingly beautiful, not just convenient to the story but as integral as the actors themselves, illuminating the human emotions that are such a part of this film. Maybe it is in the penultimate performances of its players, so truthful and lush that if Mr. Choi were to recreate his character on a bare stage, I would still be riveted. Some have had the audacity to accuse this fine actor of over-acting. To that I say if such is the case, then all the other acting performances that i have witnessed have been woefully under-acted. Maybe it is the wonderfully hypnotic score, or the vibrant colors or engaging dialog's(lines that are as memorable as they are fitting). Whatever it may be, I am a better film fan for having seen it.

Some may accuse me of exaggeration or hyperbole. Watch it for yourself. Ask yourself after you have seen it if it has not affected you in some real way, whether good or bad.

The mark of a great film can often be found in the lobby of the theater, or the neighboring diner, or (perhaps more fittingly) in internet forums, where the merits of the film can spark lively debates among those who have seen the film. It's images refuse to leave the recesses of your mind, and so you ponder, argue, proclaim ideas amongst those who have had the same experience. Such is the film Old Boy. Whether this movie was to your tastes or not, you cannot deny that it leaves its mark on you.",10.0,18 January 2005
Complex thriller,"Lets start saying that OLDBOY recently got the 2004 Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival; probably the most prestigious Film Festival in the world, so that must mean something about this movie.

Directed by Chanwook Park a Korean director, who was also responsible for Joint Security Area and Sympathy of Vengeance two dark superb and unexpected thrillers albeit somehow slow for the American taste?

This time, pace is a lot faster, but the movie takes the darkness of his previous work to unexpected limits.

The story seems simple. Drunk and irresponsible men is kidnapped one night and kept captive for a long time, in a room with a TV set. His wife is killed at the same moment, becoming the prime suspect; his daughter sends to foster parents.

He plots to escape and get revenge on his kidnapers, but everyday he is treated with brainwash drugs and hypnosis. After 15 years he is suddenly released without any explanation. He receives money and a cell phone, from where a voice tells him that he must seek revenge.

With the help of a young woman he accidentally meets, he starts seeking his captors in a growing spiral of violence, but everybody around him seems to be part of a plot leading him to unexpected situations.

What starts as a vengeance movie, slowly becomes a puzzle where all pieces match by the end. This is like THE SIX SENSE without the phantasms.

Chanwook Park has created a movie about the human condition, about the subjectivity of good and bad. When the movie reaches its conclusion, all-moral values are destroyed and many people will be looking for the purifying fire that never arrives. I cannot tell more without spoiling the movie, but let us just say that according to this movie, SIN IS A MATTER OF KNOWLEDGE.

Beware; this movie is for adults. Not because of the sex scenes that are just what the movie needed or the violence that is probably more than necessary, but because no young person could ever understand how deeply philosophical this movie gets.",,27 June 2004

A family thing,"Oddly having seen the Spike Lee Americanized remake first, I preferred the critically lambasted Oldboy slightly more than the Korean original. Talk about going out on a limb.

Oh Dea-Su goes out drinking on his daughter's birthday and finds himself imprisoned in a room for 15 years. He is also suspected of killing his wife. He has no idea who has captured him and for what reason.

15 years on he is released and given just five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him. Oh Dae-Su sees this as a chance of getting revenge, he has kept himself in shape while he was locked up and goes out looking for answers, he also falls in love with a young woman along the way.

The film is a Gothic revenge tale with graphic violence and a nod to The Count of Monte Cristo and Oedipus Rex.

It seems that Oh Dea-Su's nemesis has set up a complex and contrived form of revenge that spans years. Like Oh Dea-Su you yearn for the answers and you root for him as he beats up all-comers some literally to a pulp.

However I found the ending to be messy and unnecessarily graphic and gruesome. The remake had an elegant ending which was more palatable. Also I found the lead actor hard to take as a bad ass.

Josh Brolin in the remake I could buy as the rowdy student in his youth or the drunken boor as a young man. When he is released I can see him being grungy and violent as he hunts down the people who locked him up.

Still Oldboy was critically lauded and regarded as a masterpiece of modern South Korean cinema and is worth a watch.",6.0,23 December 2015
If only more people voted...,"There is one principle in politics which roughly says that the bigger a lie is,the easier it can be swallowed by a great number of people: I think that this can also be extended to films, that is to say that sometimes a film is so bad that it appears like a masterpiece to a great number of viewers: Oldboy, (and, in my opinion, 'The Shining' as well)illustrates this to a degree I have never seen before: what do we have in this film? 1)the movie is filmed like an below-average MTV-clip all along, something that, I do not doubt it, might be viewed as 'great cinema art' by some people, but, in my opinion, only denotes bad direction. 2) this film is full of totally and extremely distasteful violence and gore,added for 'shock-value, something that, I suppose, can certainly seem 'extremely impressive and audacious'to some people, but only left me and very probably other viewers as well with an impression of extreme boredom and reinforced my feeling that this denoted the total vacuity and senselessness of this film. 3)The plot, which I will not reveal here (I will leave it to the 'appreciation' of future viewers), is of a poverty many B-grade TV-movies would be jealous of. 4) And, of course, last but not least, the film got a prize at the Cannes film festival. So, what we do finally get here is a perfect 'screen of smoke'generated in order to prevent the viewer to see what lies beneath. There is, however, one thing that I noticed which greatly reassured me: the fact that the comments of the users who disliked the movie were found useful by a far greater number of people than the comments of the people who liked it: taking this into account, we get a far more accurate perception of the general feeling of the audience, a fact which is, unfortunately not reflected in the overall user rating, a user rating which would have been significantly different and maybe have sent 'Oldboy' out of the IMDb top 250, a better deserved place.

I expect Oldboy to age rather quickly.,"Oldboy is a film that is colourful and cinematic. It blends martial arts and action in with a plot in such a way, it's easy to just ogle at the special effects and stunts on show. Oldboy in terms of these stunts and effects is just another example of Asian film and what they do so well but this is an example that was unnecessary. Certainly, you have your 'art' films in the form of Hero and House of Flying Daggers that rely heavily on sublime aesthetical quality as well as stunts and hypnotically good music but with Oldboy, it's like it's merely 'House of Flying Daggers: for teens' and this is because it just tries to gross the audience out whilst use a lame revenge story to fill in the blanks.

There can be no denying that Oldboy tries to tread filmic ground that teens will have no idea even existed and this comes in the form of voyeurism. There is a scene in which a boy sucks the breast of a girl whilst another boy secretly watches from a nook in the wall  what's interesting here is that not only is the third party's view in point of view format (meaning that it's supposed to signify us watching) but half way through, the girl pulls out a mirror just so that she can watch her own reaction to the activity being carried out.

The film eventually starts out like any other revenge film  a guy is back on his feet after a stretch in a prison of some sort and goes after answers as to why he was there. The film tries to play cat and mouse with a mysterious cell phone: 'Whose calling?' and 'Why are they?' Yes, I wonder. He also manages to shack up with a female character after an encounter in a sushi bar that involves a particularly memorable scene involving an octopus that I knew nothing about until actually watching the film. This is where Oldboy begins its journey of a revenge film gone very, very wrong and I don't mean that as a negative statement, it's just that Oldboy is so audacious and over the top in its delivery of rather pointless content that when you think about it, it's difficult to get too excited.

Oldboy fails to suck you in  it just doesn't create an atmosphere. Despite its ratings and 'disturbing content', I actually found the film to be rather upbeat, almost like a comedy at times. There is the humble breaking of reality when the film pauses and a dotted line showing the intended line of attack a hammer will undergo once that character swings it is funny more than anything else. There is also an emphases on 'nothing dialogue'. When two people are talking down the phone about a formal school girl from years ago who was, from their memory, 'a total slut'; I was wondering if this was meant to be funny or if it was setting up a character for later on or whatever  I was left confused more than convinced. There's also plenty of room for ancient Chinese or Japanese or maybe even Korean proverbs that characters spout to one another. This is Oldboy again trying to be something it is not.

In regards to the 'gross, sensitive' content, I say ""what content?"" The guy eating the live octopus was surprising more than it was gross  I've eaten both octopus and squid before (obviously not live) but so what? The sex? Well, what about it? Try Basic Instinct or Boogie Nights or anything else of that variety. Again, it's for teens: 'Oh look, a sex scene(!)'. The 'graphic scenes of torture' involves someone having their teeth yanked out.....for about three seconds. Again, try watching work from Takeshi Miike or one of the Hostel films. Yes, Oldboy was violent what with its hammers and its snapped toothbrushes and its broken up shards of compact disc but so what? Violence is in most films these days. To conclude: Octopus scene = Surprising; Torture = Brief; Sex = Soft; Violence = Graphic so that's one out of four done to a graphic extent.

Oldboy failed to impress me in ways it has others as I just know there are better films out there. It tried to be something that it wasn't yet at the same time, has some redeeming features that keep it from being an out and out 'bad' film.",6.0,23 August 2007

Having heard people say this is a brutal film (kinda) and that it is a Korean film made me really curious. Chan-wook Park is the director (love the guy for all his f'ed-up stories) and is telling the story of 5 days of self-reflection and realization that revenge is not a necessity or a good idea, but hinders everyone involved when acted upon. I agree that Park has said the thoughts of violence and revenge are fine and are normal but when you turn those into actions, it is wrong. Strongly agree.

Performances, all top-notch. Cinematography, editing, lighting, production design perfectly great.",9.0,24 October 2020
Twisted story but with great acting and prop use,"The trailer is no indication of what you will sit through as the film plays. I was at the same time both deeply disturbed and a little intrigued to see how it would end. Safe to say, I was not at all prepared to spend my Friday night like that. I can't say much without giving away the surprising elements of the film, but if you are considering watching the film, just bear in mind that you will probably be traumatised.

I think the reason why I reacted so strongly (and negatively) to this film, is because I have been brought up in a society which considers these topics taboo and cannot even think to imagine if this were to happen to me. So in a way, the film questions the conventions of society and challenges us by putting us outside our comfort zone (way outside).

The acting is great as the actors/actresses fully embodied their characters. The interactions between Min-sik, Ji-tae and Hye-jeong went smoothly and is realistic to watch. Min-sik does his character justice as a tortured man with almost nothing left to lose. Ji-tae while still having the looks of an innocent young man delivers the emotions of a sadistic and somewhat mentally unstable character creatively. Hye- jeong too, plays her role as the innocent and oblivious damsel well. However, it seems like a waste to have her introduced as a strong independent woman at the beginning and then turn her into a shallow headed female who is basically useless. Going off that, this film is so obviously male centred, and females are only used for their bodies.

The use of props though used mostly for violent acts, are very impactful. A hammer becomes part of Min-sik's signature, replaced teeth turns into a clue, photographs are used to reveal past events and gift boxes no longer connote something positive. The director and writers (based on comic) are quite ingenious in this way, and everything is displayed in a way that ties to the end. Still, I will not be watching this again or the Hollywood remake for that matter.",8.0,13 January 2016
Oldeuboi: Entirely Exquisite,"The second of Chan-wook Park's ""Vengeance Trilogy"", Oldeuboi appears to be the most revered and respected of the thematic triplets. Having absolutely loved the first, Boksuneun naui Geot, I was highly sceptical that this could possibly do any better.

Having been imprisoned inexplicably for fifteen years, Dae-su Oh finds himself released just as suddenly and mysteriously. Knowing nothing about where or why he was kept, he sets out on a quest for revenge, meeting along the way a sushi chef with whom he begins to fall in love.

One of the opening scenes, in which Dae-su stumbles drunkenly about a police station, provides us with nice humour: partly a way to lull us into a false sense of security; partly a way to make the darkness which follows tolerable. Like its predecessor, Oldeuboi is incredibly dark and gritty, both its themes and imagery constantly exploring the very depths of depravity and despair. The scenes of imprisonment are strange: while Dae-su's cage is neither bare nor uncomfortable, he himself becomes increasingly so, the scenes of graduating delusion and hallucinating building to an inevitable crescendo of tragedy. It is difficult to watch him spiral downwards, not least of all when he learns that he has been framed for the murder of his wife. Min-sik Choi's performance incorporates a flurry of perfectly timed and pitched emotions, cementing an incredibly real character within our minds and allowing him to evolve whilst all the while remembering his thirst for vengeance and the effect of his incarceration. Hye-jeong Kang grounds the film with a meek humility, her unassuming sushi chef the only element of sanity in Dae-su's insane world. The narrative effectively keeps us guessing, the final turns in plot unforeseen and quite striking, adding to the facets a consistently excellent story, and one which invites thought in a genuine manner. Worth noting is the corridor sequence relatively early in the film, a superb technical achievement and one of the film's crowning glories. A true spectacle which presents action in a unique way, bringing a brilliance to what might have been a mundane scene.

An entirely exquisite follow-up to the first of the trilogy, Oldeuboi succeeds under the magnificence of Park's direction. Ensuring the further remarkableness of this astounding offering, it leaves all demanding to see part three. For me, it falls just short of the level of excellence achieved by its forebear. An amazing film in any case, it is yet another example of the prowess of South Korean cinema.",8.0,27 July 2010

At least, ""Oldboy"" had something that resembled a coherent plot, but this certainly isn't groundbreaking in any way. In the end, it felt like a two hour endurance test. There were no compelling performances, no memorable scenes, just a dark, forgettable film.

Laugh and the World Laughs With You. Weep and You Weep Alone.,"One of the most visually impressive films of the 2000's with meticulously craft directing from Chan-Woo Park. But also easily one of the most devastating films you'll see. It rips your heart out in more ways than one.

A revenge tale is only as good as the characters are written, and this film is brilliantly adapted from the 90's comic. The characters, who were apparently not developed enough in the comic, are well established within the first 20 minutes. All characters are brought around nicely by the time the credits roll, which contributes to the devastation of the film's emotional gut punch towards the end.

One of the main reasons the characters work so nicely, is that Park provides character development in more ways than one. Whether it be through an important close up on our lead character's face or even a well-timed artistic metaphor, the story is so well-realized through its characters. Being that it's a tragic story that turns into a revenge flick but then turns back into a tragic tale again, you need to believe both sides of the coin. Min-sik Choi and Ji-tae Yu do a tremendous job at rounding out motivations as Dae-su and Woo-jin respectively.

In order to feel the full impact of emotion Park was going for, you have to be with the film every step of the way. Although there are some plot points that blur the lines of being plot holes, Park gives us at least an acceptable answer to keep us engaged. Even just looking at the thrilling action sequences, which can be over-the-top and 'Raid'- like at times, is acceptable after seeing the finished product.

Oldboy is a modern day classic. Not necessarily the type of film I would want to revisit more than once, but I got the full emotional impact that I had hoped for. Chan-Woo Park majestically directs the comic to life better than anyone possibly could.

One of the best Asian films of all time,"Oldboy, Chan-wook Park's best movie to date, won the Grand Prize of the Jury in Cannes Film Festival (and it was also nominated for Palme d' Or), as well as the best film and best Screenplay awards in Fantasporto (the most serious fantasy festival). As probably everyone knows Chan-wook Park's obsession is the theme of revenge. Old boy is the second movie of his revenge trilogy (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance - 2002, Oldboy and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance - 2005). Oldboy is by far the best movie of the trilogy and one of the best Asian films of all time. Drama, mystery and thriller are thrown in the film in equal portions, which is humorously violent and brutally funny. If you have no idea about the excellent South Korean (or Japanese) modern cinema this is a good movie to start exploring them.

Grade: A",8.0,28 November 2015
Stylistically brilliant but way too unbelievable,"I know, I know: it's a movie, I'm supposed to suspend my disbelief etc. But even so, I just couldn't buy the ending of this movie.

The story is very good, though, and the plot twists are believable and work well (up until the end). I also loved the contemporary film noir style of this film. Lots of deep, scarlet reds, purples and black illuminated under fluorescent lighting or stark, low-watt bulbs.

An abridged telling of the story would tell you that this is a film about one man's revenge and penance. Dae-su Oh, a notorious drunk, is imprisoned in a nondescript hotel room for 15 years, without being told who imprisoned him or why. After he manages to escape, he finds that things are eerily set-up to ease him back into life on the outside - a homeless man gives him a cell phone and a wallet filled with cash, a young sushi waitress appears to take a shine to him, after passing out in the street, he's immediately picked up and rescued by a stranger.

It would be unfair to give out any other information, since the first two-thirds of this film are deeply satisfying on an intellectual and a sensory level. It's a rich experience and, even with all the blood and grit, there's a sophisticated neatness to each frame. The direction is sublime and I think you could pause any shot and marvel at how gorgeous this film looks. The soundtrack and visuals, together, make for a stunning experience and the performance by Min-sik Choi needs to be seen to be believed.

But then, you get to the last part of the film. The finale, the moment where all will be revealed, and Dae-su is vindicated. And... it all falls a bit flat. IMO. Sure there's a decent twist but I wasn't buying the depths of madness these characters would go to to achieve ""revenge"". The end seemed a tad illogical and it felt like a cop out, as if the writers couldn't come up with a more realistic scenario.

I read somewhere that's it's based on a Manga, so maybe that's why it's so twisted and maybe the ending makes more sense in a comic book but I wasn't convinced.

I would recommend checking this out, if only because it grips you from the start and because it offers such a rich visual and auditory experience. In the end, though, you might be disappointed.",7.0,31 January 2010

"Technically well made, story silly and gross","The good: the film is aesthetically shot in a unique and cool style, with some good action scenes (hammer fight was cool:). Actors are great.

The bad: the characters are flat and one-dimensional. The story is totally silly and unrealistic (e.g. stereotype crazy bad guy spends what must be millions of dollars and years of detailled planning to get revenge... drunk guy learns being kunfgu master from watching tv... people hypnotized.. these things would be cool in an Austin Powers slapstick comedy movie, but here..??!). As a result, any attempt to convey the serious themes tackled (revenge, incest etc) fails from the absurdity and lack of realism of the story. On top comes gory and partly disgusting violence, which doesn't really support the plot (but probably shocking stuff sells to some more primitive target audiences?). As time passes and the film drags on, the story becomes increasingly tedious and boring to follow, finally putting viewers out of their misery in a fittingly absurd finale.

All in all: great craftsmanship but awful story = waste of time; can't really recommend it to anyone.",5.0,24 November 2020

Give it a go,"Visually stunning as a film, Oldboy's strange, twisted tale will not appeal to everyone's taste. It's brutal display of life, human emotion and love is unlike of that seen in any other film, allowing for a truly unique cinematic experience. Drained of colour in its cinematography, Min-sik Choi performance is truly captivating, allowing a insight to the human psychology.

Despite significant plot holes in Oldboy's narrative, its uniqueness and complete departure of traditional filmic techniques allows viewers to dismiss this fact.

Essentially a revenge film, Oldboy remains a fantastic piece of Asian cinema. Although not aimed at Western audiences, for those who walk into this film with an open mind will be rewarded.",7.0,27 February 2009

I will not spoil anything at all, i will just say this. there is blood, there is pain, there is a sharp reality to the acting, and there is a sense that you got to watch it again some day. I came away from the cinema feeling satisfied and feeling good that not all films have a ""just"" ending that makes everything alright.....almost a reality in that, and almost a reality in some of the things that go on, sad, but us humans are a violent and devious lot, still, i am glad it is fiction and not a documentary, but sometimes throughout the film i did wonder...Oldboy, a film",9.0,11 December 2017
A mess,"OK, perhaps there is truth in the saying ""lost in translation"" because I absolutely do not understand why this movie has garnered the praise it has. It is a mess, an absolute mess from beginning to end. The only positive thing I can say about it is the wickedly twisted revenge plot. There is no cohesive story line, no attempt to give the viewer any kind of clue about what is going on. You are kept in the dark the whole time, which I assume is the point. But by the time the final credits roll, you want to borrow one of the hammers used in the movie and beat yourself over the head with it to stop the pain that the film inflicts on your senses from trying to make any kind of sense of it.

I have since gone back and watched this film again without the dubbed soundtrack and though I still feel it is way over hyped, I do not feel it is as bad as my initial review of it above. I have given it another star from my original 4 that I gave it. Still, the movie",5.0,27 August 2005

Get past the first 45 minutes and the reward will be a great last act,"After looking back at it, it had; amazing acting, good symbolism and great plot-twists. Unfortunately, the first 30 minutes are almost unbearable, as only the movie description here on IMDb actually gives any hint as to how the story is going to progress and everything up until that point in the movie have been obnoxious and pretentious. However, once the story actually kicks into gear, some 15 minutes later, the movie becomes decent. There are plenty of cases of good cinematography, while the dialogue is a mix of philosophical quotes or important exposition. There is also a noticeable shift from the pretentious first part, to an action sequence, montage sequence, flashback sequence and finally a dramatic sequence. This shift was disorienting as to what the tone of the movie was intended to be. The later act is definitely the high point and is executed well, but is impossible to predict as it is mostly based on newly given information and does not make up for the previous runtime.

Unfortunately, the story heavily relies on the exclusive compelling objective of the main protagonist, and while that had a great conclusion, it was not that compelling on its own - as pointed out by the side-kick. Sure, there is a time limit, but there are no other hurdles in the ""mastered martial arts via the TV""-protagonist's way to make it suspenseful up until the very end...",6.0,13 November 2020
Powerful performance,"""Oldboy"" (2003), directed by Park Chan-wook, is a gripping South Korean thriller known for its intense storyline and visceral visual style. The film tells the tale of a man imprisoned for 15 years without explanation, then suddenly released and set on a path of revenge. Choi Min-sik delivers a powerful performance, portraying a complex blend of desperation, confusion, and rage. The film is renowned for its bold narrative twists and deeply disturbing themes, challenging the viewer's sense of morality and justice. Its infamous hallway fight scene is a standout, showcasing raw, unflinching action.

A Brutal Game of Revenge,"This was a movie that I learned existed when I got into listening to podcasts, I heard a lot about it and this one went on my shortlist of movies to see due to that. It still took me awhile to watch it though. Something that is interesting is there is quite a bit of debate about whether this is horror or not. Before seeing this, I heard the arguments on both sides and I can see both arguments. Since horror is the only genre that I do in-depth reviews on, you can guess where I lie and I'll get into that a bit later.

Synopsis: after being kidnapped and imprisoned for fifteen years, Oh Dae-su (Min-ski Choi), only to find that he must find his captor in five days.

To expand on what the synopsis states, we meet our main character, Dae-su, while he's at the police station. He's drunk and causing a ruckus until his friend No Joo-hwan (Dae-han Ji) shows up to take him home. They leave and Joo-hwan uses a payphone to call his family. It is raining and we see a pair of angel wings in a paper bag. Dae-su had them on for a moment in the police station as they are a gift for his daughter. This man disappeared.

Things then take a turn. Dae-su is in a room with a steel door. There is a little hatch that is opened and he pleads with his captor. Food is put through and then closed. We see Dae-su and the things that he does to stay sane. He tattoos a mark for each year he is there on his hand. He uses the television to help him keep time, the date, school at home and even church. There is a picture hanging that has the lines: 'Laugh and the world laughs with you. Cry and you cry alone'. There is also something weird where he is knocked out periodically with gas. They then cut his hair and other upkeep that they can't trust him with due the tools used. To try and stay sane, Dae-su also trains his body to fight. He uses his time to try and escape as well.

There is a day where he is hypnotized and wakes up on a rooftop. I did forget to state that we started here with someone hanging over the edge, being held only by his tie while he has a dog. The person not in peril then stated he wants to tell his story. It turns out the one holding him up was Dae-su. He's now free and trying to figure out who held him captive for these 15 years.

This leads him to a sushi restaurant where to meet Mi-do (Hye-jeong Kang). From what I gathered, Dae-su saw her on TV for a cooking show. She ends up taking Dae-su home with her when he passes out. She tends to his wounds and the two of them have a sexual attraction. She aids him in trying to figure out what happened to him and who was behind it. The problem is that he doesn't necessarily trust her or anyone around him. We do also keep seeing the character of Lee Woo-jin (Ji-Tae Yoo).

Dae-su is told that he has 5 days to figure it out, by July 5th, before all the women in his life are killed, starting with Mi-do. While he was locked up, he heard his wife was murdered and since he was missing, he's the prime suspect. Because of everything, his daughter was adopted by a couple in Sweden. Or that is what he thinks happened with her.

He ends up seeking out his friend, Joo-hwan, who now runs an internet café, to help him piece together everything that happened. It will take him back to high school and something that happened there. His pursuit of revenge though will take him to the limits and do unspeakable things.

That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. I think that I should address the elephant in the room to start my actual analysis. Is Oldboy a horror movie? It falls into that adjunct category. There are dark elements. This movie is a revenge film and that plays out in more than one way. Lee wants revenge on Dae-su and vice versa. We get action as there are wild sequences. There is also gore that comes from these. There is drama, there is mystery and this is for sure a thriller. What I have left out is if this is a horror movie.

I do personally think there are elements and some of those come from what is presented to us. Dae-su is held in this 'cell' for 15 years. When he released, he is told that he is now in a much larger, different type of prison. Reflecting on this is a beautiful yet demented thing. Dae-su is so stuck on learning the truth, he's trapped. Revenge is also a terrifying thing that will cause you to lose your humanity, but that has already been stripped away by the torture of his original prison. Dae-su must come to terms with what happened to him to get his revenge. There are a couple of scenes with graphic images. That doesn't make it horror though. I do think that this falls into modern exploitation with the torture and the truth behind the sexual elements as well. The long game and the reveals are dark with our main villain being scarred and perverse. What he pushes and forces Dae-su to do is horrific.

I've done it in the past, but I don't think I'm going to delve into a spoiler section. There isn't a need as I don't think my analysis needs to present what the reveals are. I've been able to flesh out the tone of the movie without it. What I like about this movie is the acting. Seeing the effects of everything that happen to Choi, I love how he plays the effects of his psychological damage. Being held in this room for 15 years without any real contact with anyone, it has some devastating repercussions. He doesn't know why for that whole time he's there. There is a smile he does multiple times that he uses to himself to put on and it goes back to the saying on the wall in his room.

Yoo is the other side of what we get. The grudge he is holding and why is hard to fault him. What he does though is a bit over the top, but the effects of the event behind this has a similar effect to the ones done to Dae-su. Kang plays her role well also. Her reveal was spoiled for me, but to be honest, it didn't affect my viewing. She plays her role well and we get to see her topless. That is something I won't complain about. I'd say the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed as well.

The last thing that I wanted to go over would be the effects. We don't get as much as I was expecting, but I'll glad they went practical. There are action sequences where Dae-su fights a group of guys. There is one that isn't perfect but was done in one take. That is impressive. We get some torture scenes that look realistic. One with the claw of a hammer and teeth that made me cringe. There's another scene that plays on this as well. The blood looks good and the cinematography is solid. I did see this is based on a comic and I could tell that before confirming. It looks like they pulled certain scenes right off a page and brought them to life. It worked for me for sure.

In conclusion, I'm glad I finally ticked this off my list. This is an interesting revenge film that has a story deeper than I was expecting. For the modern era, the Koreans know how to do this sub-genre. The acting from our three stars helps to bring this to life. The practical effects work for me. This clocks in at 2 hours, but I barely noticed that. It caught my attention and I love piecing together the story as we go. Dae-su needs to remember and learn, just as we are as well. This is one I have a feeling my rating is going to go up. I can't come in with a perfect score with this first viewing, but it is a great movie for me. It held up with the second watch and seeing it in the theater was great as well.

Absolutely stunning,"Chan-wook Park had a vision. A vision that this film would pull on all the senses. The disgust of taboo, the despair of loneliness, the hilarity of tradgedy. Oldboy mixes a bit of Tarantino with a lot of Kubrick in a thriller that does almost everything right.

The writing is fantastic. It is visionary and spacious. It is artistic and playful. It is definitely not a 'realistic' film. Although the pace is whiplash inducing, the film always manages to get across its point. It is cold, then it is warm. It is utterly tragic and then it is hilarious. The cinematography is innovative and memorable. The action sequences are unbelievably fun to watch. The choreography was simply beautiful.

It's hard to describe a film like this which I feel has certain...problems but somehow it would not be doing the film justice to give it less than the highest praise that I can award it. I believe this can be a timeless film that all aspiring art film producers must watch and learn from for time in perpetuum. Not every director can make an 'Oldboy', and it's not clear that Park could even do it again. These are once-in-a-career type films. The very definition of a magnum opus.",9.0,26 January 2021

Holy. What did I just watch...

South Korean movies seem to be especially brutal with revenge movies. I Saw The Devil was the most notorious one that I have seen, until I saw this movie.

The beginning of the story was slow and weird. The style and editing made me feel pretty uneasy. I thought that it would just be a typical revenge quest with a bit of romance.

However, when the twist hits and I reflected back to what I just saw, I have never felt more disgusted and filthy after watching a movie. This was even more shocking than after I watched Invisible Guest. After that, I was in horror as I watched one of the main characters breaking down.

Violence isn't just skin deep,"Oldboy

At it's heart there lies a story of lost innocence and revenge. In this journey, director Chan-wook Park, travels a road where we question what lies after the righting of a supposed wrong, and the price that man will go to in order to maintain a sense of not knowing.

As has become the tradition with much reporting of graphic Southeast and East Asian cinema, a focus on violence and vivid imaginary overshadows the intricacies of narrative development. Of course it doesn't hold an eighteen rating for no reason, but for a moment lets forget some of the comic-book violence in which it excels.

Our story focuses on the 15-year imprisonment of Dae-su Oh (the man who gets along with others),confined to a dwelling that has all the apparent comforts of a modern South Korean apartment, but with the added bonus of piped hallucinogenic drugs making our protagonist more susceptible to hypnotic suggestion. Like our prisoner, for much of the film's duration we are limited to understanding why this event has taken place. In the meantime we are invited to embrace both the intentional and unintentional comic and tragic moments that follow as the ticking years wind the tension of retribution as we go from supposed breakout to the incidences of assumed chance meetings. Where true understanding of our journey is confined and complex questions asked in the last twenty minutes of the film, we are treated to flashes of inspirational camera work and effects, which do not in any way detract from the sense of this film. It would be easy to dismiss the violence as over the top, but as Dae-su Oh asks, does fifteen years of imagery training prepare one for the battles that will ensue. Along that way we are treated to a familiarity of claw hammer and human skull, which will have you both wincing and smirking at the same time. Fistfights that will make you take sharp intakes of breath as bone smacks bone in a not altogether unbelievable way.

Although not gripping from beginning to end, you do want to find out the reason for such a complex game of cat and mouse, which in essence is what the plot revolves around. Where it is easily possible to miss some of the bigger questions this film asks, if your able to maintain your interest and look beyond the surface violence, days later you can still find yourself asking what price you would be prepared to pay in order to forget or not know, and whether holding onto grudges of the past are really worth expending all that energy.",7.0,9 January 2005

Keeping it in the family,"The family does seem to be a focus in Asian cinema, and this is no exception. Being imprisoned in a room for 15 years for no immediate reason is a very good start to an exceptional film. But the closeness of the interiors does not seem to stop once our hero is released to get his revenge.

The violence in the film while never meaningless does seem to weave a strong unpleasant backbone that gives the film its vivid consistency. But its not a logic - its never an and in itself. While there is a lot borrowed from the modern stylised thriller, which always involves some sort of identity problem, e.g. Seven, Fight club, Momento etc, the film is much more than the sum of its parts. The director has a sense of timing that can only come about from the strength of the written material.

But ultimately this is still Asian cinema, with Asian values, yet its fighting for Western cinema audiences. It will be interesting to see which culture makes way first.",7.0,18 December 2004
Best film at Cannes? Please explain.,"I just saw this at the Philly film festival and I was amazed at how so many people were conned into thinking this was such a great movie. While sitting on the steps before the movie started (all seats were sold out at that point) I heard such a buzz: ""...best Korean film of all time... won best picture at Cannes... ending will blow you away..."". In fact the guy who introduced OLDBOY said to the anxious crowd before the lights went dark that ""OLDBOY may be the greatest movie ever made"". I must admit I almost fell for it too. It looks beautiful and the director is nothing if not innovative and technically brilliant. However the praise goes only as deep as the razor thin plot line. To say this movie is contrived is a drastic understatement. I don't want to give anything away (why? I'm not quite sure) but lets just say this: the ridiculous ending to Park's OLDBOY is on par with the likes of Shamalan's SIGNS and whoever the moron was who directed last year's abysmal SAW. Now if you were amazed by the ludicrous 11th hour revelations in those movies (although SIGNS at least was pretty good up to that point) then you probably won't feel utterly cheated and let down by OLDBOY. I found myself saying ""good God they can't be serious!"". I can't really trash the movie for too many other reasons other than the weak story and atrocious ending. Everything else was pretty good, not #92 of all time and Cannes darling good, but decent and enjoyable. I actually cared about the characters which almost never happens in movies today, and the blood and violence which others have complained about I thought was a strong point. But the story! Come on already. I'm in awe that Quentin Tarantino, who can spin a story like no other, bought into OLDBOY. Another prime example of writers managing to stink up a great premise. One more thing, Park's earlier film SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, while also no masterpiece, was far, far superior to OLDBOY in my opinion. Worth watching.",5.0,25 April 2005
"Good movie, not as hard to watch as I thought","I was hesitant to watch this because of the reviews warning about torture. What I found was a director who, just as in the golden age of cinema, leaves graphics to the imagination. Most movies today go so completely into graphic sex and violence that there is nothing left to the imagination. This movie was very intense, but in no way as gross and sick as many I've seen in modern times.

The story is good, and like many martial arts movies where you know the hero can't possibly take on that many villains at a time, but he does anyway, you suspend reality and just go with the story. The director lets us use our own imagination and fantasy.

After 15 years, who is better off? That's the moral of this revenge tale.",9.0,23 February 2020

Oldboy or revenge campaign to infinity,"In the late '80s, Oh Dae-soo, the utterly average father of the family, was abducted from his own house and held for years in a private cell where the only connection to the outside world was for him to be a television. This is how he learns that his wife has been killed and the police suspect him. His pointless and incomprehensible detention reaches a determined inner revenge after initial despair. He is released 15 years later, without any explanation. This basic story could be, done badly full of clichés, or it could be the way Park Chan-wook staged this revenge movie going on indefinitely. The main concept is based on trust. The protagonist Oh Dae-soo doesn't know who to trust and who will help someone who has been detained for 15 years for his own entertainment. The amount of gore and violence the director brought to the screen was never so faithfully shown. All nudity, all tooth extractions, self-tattoos, injuries, are all portrayed realistically. Min sik-choi fantastically brings the desperate average man who, in the midst of all ordeals, is trying to survive and take revenge. The cinematography work is brilliant. Especially the one-minute scene where Oh Dae-soo handles it alone or 50 people and 15 more are waiting for him in the elevator. Fantastic scene, already in itself is why you watch the movie.",9.0,2 June 2020

"Pretty good, but could be great","Lots has been said about this film. It is neither a classic nor a flop. When I heard the premise for this film I thought it would be great. It intrigued me and I wanted to know what had happened to this chararcter that led to him being locked away for 15 years and then released with some kind of mission. The film starts well and it looks nice. I don't mind the shaky camera work from time to time, that some reviewers seem upset about. Some people love those fight scenes, while I find them all a little childish, but it is a comic book film. There is a reasonable amount of violence, but nothing that would put me off the film. The soundtrack is decent. Unfortunately the film then simply fails to deliver. The plot becomes a little silly, which is a great shame because it could be brilliant. But it's not. Nor is it crap.

Is it safe?,"One of my all time favourite movies. I was lucky enough to see this 4K restored version. Nothing short of brilliant. A guy who's constantly annoying local police with his drunken antics gets kidnapped and is held captive for 15 years. On his release he meets a sushi chef in a restaurant who he's become fascinated with on tv during his captivity. Together they try and make sense of the last 15 years which leads to an unimaginable conclusion. Good violent scenes throughout, including 'Marathon Man' type tooth removal scenes. Superb.

proving that style and sizzle does not a movie make,"A movie without ideas or theme that is long on cinematic style (but then, so are MTV videos and most successful commercials) and short on recognizable human interest (unless you are a first-world adolescent, in which case you will idolize its sadomasochistic cool and eye candy, not to mention the fact that its emotional center appears to be high school). Let's not even talk about artistic merit. Quentin Tarantino (maker of one, perhaps two great movies and a couple of good entertainments) is the most obvious salesman for the view that pulp junk, polished up and translated by cinematic trickery and fascinated with its own pop cultural hipness, is valuable (and Tarantino was on the committee at Cannes that gave this film the Grand Jury Prize). Park steals here from some of the greats (film noir specialists like Hitchcock, absurdists like Bunuel, masters of cinema cool like Kubrick), but lacks any feeling for what made *their* movies worth seeing. Put simply, it lacks wit (unless by wit you only mean slapstick), and its ideas are like bad homilies no one understands. I keep encountering this in the newer Japanese and Korean and Hong Kong cinema that seems influenced by Tarantino: comic book themes and characters pass through high-polish celluloid/digital trickery and a ironic pop filter (all borrowed). I hear Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, which I have but still haven't been able to force myself to sit through, is much the same. Avoid.",3.0,4 March 2006

It is an amazing piece of work, right from the start. The acting, the direction, the camerawork, is just incredible, and the music score, is so good.

What a ride...,"This is probably the movie that brought me into Asian cinema. I had seen a few films of Kurosawa or John Woo before, but I never took a look further into it. Oldboy changed that completely. Oh Dae-su is kidnapped on his daughter's birthday and then held captive for 15 years. He than one day wakes up on top of a skyscraper, at the exact same spot he was captured. Now he is looking for the reason of his captivity and he wants revenge

I first heard about this movie from other critics calling it one of the best movies of its year or something along those lines. So I rented it and was absolutely stunned. The cinematography is so beautiful yet gruesome, it's full of pictures that will stay in your head days after watching it. Might it be one of the memorable fight scenes or the breath-taking finale. The story is very simple in its premise, but develops very well and takes a few unexpected turns. A guy looking for revenge sounds very familiar and not original at all, but what Park Chan-wook does with it, is something no one else could have done the same way. In my opinion he might very well be one of the best directors of the last decade and this shows exactly why. Choi Min-sik and Yu Ji-tae do an amazing job playing their respective roles. The often very unusual scenes aren't easy to play, but the two pull it off pretty good. The other actors do a decent job as well. The soundtrack is just great and has a style close to romantic composer Edvard Grieg. The songs fit perfectly to the scenes and underline the tragic tone of the movie.

I think this is one of the best movies of the 2000's. It has a great story, solid actors and a magnificent score. The film may be a little violent at times and the story with its difficult themes is definitely not for everybody, but you should give it a shot.",10.0,2 May 2010
Review - Oldeuboi,"Oldboy is always violent with ""good taste"". In fight sequences, the cinematography and editing are on point and in torture scenes, Chan-wook Park doesn't show us unnecessary gore.

But that twist may not create an impact on every viewer in the same manner as it caused in most of the people who watched the film. But still that factor is not enough to consider this as a bad film.

A Thrilling Journey of Mystery and Emotion with Stunning Performances,"Oldboy is a South Korean neo-noir psychological thriller that was released in 2003. The film follows the story of Oh Dae-su, who is mysteriously kidnapped and imprisoned in a hotel room for 15 years. Upon his release, he sets out on a quest to find his captor and uncover the reason behind his imprisonment.

The main actor, Min-sik Choi, delivered an outstanding performance as Oh Dae-su. He effectively conveyed the character's emotions, which range from rage to desperation, and his transformation throughout the film was truly remarkable. His acting was a major highlight of the movie, making it an intense and captivating viewing experience.

The film also features an intriguing storyline, which keeps the audience on edge until the very end. The twists and turns of the plot were expertly crafted and left a lasting impact on viewers. The cinematography was well done, and the use of color, lighting, and sound added to the overall atmosphere of the film.

Overall, Oldboy deserves a 7 out of 10 rating. While the film can be a bit graphic and violent, it is still a well-made and thought-provoking piece of cinema. The main actor's performance, combined with the film's unique storyline, make it a must-watch for fans of psychological thrillers.",7.0,12 February 2023
Pretentious piece of fail,"When one of my friends recommended this to me, raving about how well it was filmed, the underlying themes and the general greatness of the film, I obviously expected an amazing, at least entertaining film.

The two hours I spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my time.

I understand that this movie is meant to be surreal, but even in surreal movies, there is something which anchors it down, even if it is only in the slightest. This movie, on the other hand, felt forced and fake. A lot of the shots were unnecessary and watching it made me think the director was trying to hard to be artistic.

The acting was poor, and the relationships between characters were not nearly developed enough. Maybe that's just me missing something that others could see but I hadn't even realised there was any sort of attraction between Dae su and Migo before they started getting at it like rabbits randomly half way through the film. Then again, maybe this film was just bad.

I am not against violence in movies, but in this one, almost all of it was just unnecessary. Throughout all the fight scenes I felt myself cringing at how painfully cliché it all was.

And the plot? The word laughable comes to mind. I would be amused if I hadn't wasted two hours of my life following this poorly thought out and ridiculous plot. Despite all the movie's flaws, by the end of it, I was expecting something interesting to conclude it. I won't discuss the ending, because I wouldn't want to ""spoil"" the movie for those who haven't seen it. Just that the metaphor ""Be it a rock or a grain of sand, in water they sink as the same."" cannot be used as an explanation for everything.

This entire movie was made for shock value and shock value only. I just hope sooner or later people will stop being so pretentious and recognise a bad movie for what it is. I've seen many other great Korean films and it depresses me that people have hailed Oldboy as the best.",1.0,27 December 2008

Vengeance takes on a whole new meaning!,"Old Boy (2003) is by far one of the weirdest and most disturbing films I have seen in quiet a while. I went into this movie knowing very little about the movies plot other than what was printed on the back of the movies Blu-ray cover. I knew Oldboy was a vengeance story that much was obvious but I had no idea just how twisted and insane this movie was going to be.

The story follows a ordinary man named Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) who finds himself the victim of a kidnapping. Dae-Su wakes up and finds himself prisoner inside a private makeshift prison cell with no knowledge of why he was kidnapped or for how long his captors intend on keeping him prisoner for. Dae-Su spends the next fifteen years alone, trapped within the confines of his makeshift prison with his only source of information and entertainment being a Television. Then one day without any rhyme or reason Dae-Su finds himself waking up inside a suitcase in the same place where he was kidnapped fifteen years ago. Now a free man Dae-Su sets out on a mission of vengeance to uncover why he was kidnapped and by who so he can finally exact blood soaked vengeance upon the one responsible for his suffering.

Oldboy is an absolutely stunning film that keeps it's audience on the edge of their seat from start to finish with it's cleverly written and well thought out storyline, stunning visuals, and intense fight scenes.

Film without Mercy,"What is so fascinating about Asian cinema is its radicalism and the extremes. Not only the action and the depicting representation of violence are so radical, but also when it comes to aesthetic issues that exceed the lines of occidental films. Such as ""Oldboy"" does. An attack in philosophical and aesthetic aspects: brutal, disturbing, traumatic - and beautiful. The Jury of the Cannes festival under the lead of Tarantino could not do differently than present the Grand Prix to the work of director Park Chan-wook.

""Oldboy"" is the second feature film of Park's 'Vengeance-Trilogy' which started with ""Boksuneun naui geot - Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" in 2002. The story is based on a Japanese manga book series. Park tells it in breathtaking, disturbing pictures which reflect the state of consciousness of the protagonist: In moments of emotional safety coined in aerated colors, in moments of revenge left cold and grey. A surreal atmosphere, a fragmentarily way of narrating, and a hardly decoded use of symbolism leaves the viewer without control over the reception of what he is witnessing. Instead he gets into the vortex of extremely emotions where there is actually no way out. Ungovernable anger, distress, fear, love, and pain collide with harsh cuts. The film transfers that chaos to the viewing audience brilliantly. That's what we like about Asian cinema in particular the films of Kitano, Kim, and Miike: The fathom of emotional and aesthetic extremes.

""Oldboy"" is not a birth product of the brain. In nearly every shot there is something surprising, every dialog develops a plot-twist and in every character lies a fascinating secret. Enough material that leaves us thinking about the whole point and rearrange the emotional chaos in our heads, even after days and days.",,20 February 2005
Always get pay,"Everything in this life you have to pay - this is the meaning of this film. For everything and even what you may not consider serious or do not understand it or do not even want to understand. Have you ever hurt someone because of his talkative, and if you have it so, then I have sympathy, language, laughing at someone else in order to amuse your self-esteem, spreading a bad rumor about a good man then know that it will take 15 years , 30 years, it does not matter, but you have to pay for your actions. And before you think about revenge, that you may not have such a hero in this story.

This neodnaznachnoe (неоднозначное) cinema, art house, but the art just because not everyone will understand and not to each income. Film with strong visuals, music, terrific editing and other technical twists and all at the same time the idea of the meaning of which up to an incredibly profound and relevant as ever. The movie is not about what the world is no good and no bad people, and that every action has a reaction, according to the abstruse Newton's third law.

If you compare this movie is only from the film ""A Clockwork Orange by Stanley Kubrick. In Oldboe as a succession of very severe bloody scenes hiding food for thought, food for thought. You should not be afraid of the forms of this product you should get the gist. History is made so that the audience gradually starts to think about all the above things. First, it is very easy, then hard, then mixed, and then you think about your own actions in their own lives.

Well, all these words do not mean anything to you. But the fact that the film is included in the top250 best movie website IMDb, is a better picture of the year, according to Quentin Tarantino, a member of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival, which was presented this film and, finally, a movie that will leave a serious mark on your heart. For you it means nothing? You do man?

Disturbingly dark,"I recently saw another Korean film 'I Saw the Devil' and, in light of the fact that I've now watched a film made by the same people, 'Oldboy' I'm glad I did. Because I think that many of us have been kind of lulled into believing that the only way to make a film is 'the Hollywood way.' I didn't like 'I Saw the Devil' when I started watching it, but, after persevering, I was glad I did in the end. Plus, now I feel I know Korean cinema a little better (or how it's done) I was able to enjoy (if that's the right word) 'Oldboy' from the off.

And it's certainly a difficult film to describe, let alone say who's its target audience is. A man – and not a particularly nice one – doesn't bother seeing his estranged wife and baby daughter in favour of generally going out and getting drunk. However, things quickly catch up with him when he's swiped off the streets and locked in a room for no less than fifteen years without explanation. However, during this time he's had more than a few changes of heart. Now he's not only ready to find out and punish whoever imprisoned him in the first place, but also make amends with his daughter, who is now basically grown up in his absence.

It would be easy to label Oldboy as a 'revenge thriller.' Yes, there are certainly aspects of hunting down those who wronged him. But it's the way it's done that makes it so different. I would go into specifics, but it's one of those films where if you say too much about the plot you will give away vital points which will lead to you predicting what's to come. It's fair to say that there are more than a few twists and turns to keep you interested (or disgusted?) and you will not only need to be ready for those, but also have a strong stomach in terms of content material.

Which brings me back to my thoughts on who it's marketed at. I don't really know – people who like revenge movies, but can tolerate some pretty disturbing story lines mainly. Oh, and subtitles. It's got subtitles – but then you probably guessed that. However, even though you have to read the dialogue it's still easy to tell that the cast are pretty impressive and there are performances that are going to stick with you – even if some of them are for the wrong reasons.

Basically, if you like your foreign revenge films dark then give this one a go. Just don't blame me for any therapy you may require after sitting through it. A classic, but a dark one.",8.0,4 August 2015

The movie doesn't just show you THE ANSWER, you have to think and come up with your own answers. A lot of people don't get the point of story, or they get caught up in some moral debate. What I've got out of this film is, we all try to live our lives, some keep it simple, others, complicated. But even the simplest lives will commit unintentional acts that might come back to haunt them. And in life, there are no villains or heroes. We all believe we're the good guy, but are we really??

"Intelligent, classic, entertaining masterpiece","South Korean filmmakers know how to keep a secret hidden in any film. They indeed appear like detectives when they write such films...I mean make such films. OLDBOY is a classic South Korean action thriller which has been acclaimed all over the world. It changed the way world looked at the South Korean Cinema. This film is undoubtedly from the genius Park Chan-wook, who gave us the emotional action thriller SYMPATHY FOR MR VENGEANCE. This film has excellent action which is perhaps the most classic you've ever seen in a South Korean film.

Choi Min-sik is not just an actor, he's something lot more than that. Just watch the film and then you'll believe me. He's perhaps one of the most natural actor I've ever seen. This is his best performance till date. Kang Hye-Jung is excellent and has a great role which she plays effortlessly. Yoo Ji-tae is just brilliant: his best act is in the climax which you're bound to love.

The screenplay of the film is never disappointing at all. It never deviates from telling us one of the biggest tales of all time, and it fully engages us into watching it till the end. The action is seriously classic and mindblowing. The visual effects are terrific, as is the cinematography. The natural humour present throughout the film is decent, as is the portrayal of human emotions in the most realistic and effective way.

An HFS film.,"Since watching the Best Picture winner, ""Parasite"" (twice within the same week), I've made a list of Korean films that I need to watch. ""Oldboy"" was at the top because I've heard that Tarantino liked it and it was one of the most critically acclaimed films of the 2000's. After watching this film, I was in a trance. The story is based on a graphic Japanese manga. It follows a man who gets kidnapped and incarcerated by mysterious forces, spending 15 years. Through means which I can't describe in words due to the graphic nature, the man comes back to real world but is given a limit by his mysterious captor to find out the reason of his incarceration. Much of this film is filled with surreal imagery, which is also complemented by the editing. It is very violent and graphic-possibly the most violent film I've seen. That being said; it is still a great watch-possibility for a second time",8.0,22 February 2020
This time vengeance has moulded itself to be a double-edged sword,"""Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep, and you weep alone.""

It's completely different as compared to the other traditional tales of retaliation. Simply cause this time vengeance has moulded itself to be a double-edged sword. Above all, it's an eloquent (whiffs of Kafkaesque Nightmare) delineation about how one man's single misstep could lead to disastrous consequences. Besides, there's also a tangible psychological/philosophical aspect, that would give birth to an unbidden conundrum in your mind.

Oldboy is impulsively raw, unashamedly tenacious and this same murkier posture helps it to attain the right kind of vibe and atmosphere the story craved for. Further complemented through and through by its technical prowess, that is only matched by an extraordinary enactment coming directly from the main guy i.e. Choi Min-Sik. He took precedence over everything and everyone else, period. Suffice it to say, his performance alone has elevated this film to greater heights!",8.0,16 January 2022
Best Film Of The Year,"Oldboy has to be on of the greatest revenge films ever. If not one of the best films ever.

Min-sik Choi is mind blowing as Dae-su Oh, the drunkard who is imprisoned for reasons unknown for over a decade. The film has many influences, The Count of Monte Cristo being the most obvious.

Just when you thought the revenge flick was old hat, along comes an awesome shock fest like Oldboy jammed with dark humor, action, and some of the best fight scenes in recent memory.

Many people rave about the one take fight scene where Min-sik takes on a whole gang single handedly. It's an amazing fight. And one the viewer is exhausted after watching in a way. Dae-su starts off fighting the gang frantically, claw hammer in hand, he falls to the ground, you think he's beaten, exhausted, but he comes back fighting, he falls down again, seemingly he MUST be beaten this time. But no! He fights back and when it's all over it's amazing to see he's defeated and worn down the entire gang. And all of this shot in ONE TAKE! Incredible.

There are plenty of small moments in the film that are excellent as well. One of mine being the voice over line where the hero wonders if fifteen years of pretend training can work, the short ensuing fight scene has a great, hand held kinetic energy to it. It's a mini-film school for directors on how to properly do a bad ass movie fight. And the hammer and teeth scenes are some of the most intense tooth torture scenes since the movie Marathon Man.

This is one of the best movies I've ever scene, with a twisting, turning plot that is totally off the wall and fresh and unpredictable. A revenge epic that tops or equals Kill Bill. Four stars out of four for director Chan-wook Park's masterpiece!",,9 May 2005
"Sufficiently Dark and Disturbing, Though Not Always Purposeful","A Korean action-suspense flick that, like many far-east thrillers, doesn't hesitate to take things well into the realm of the taboo. In a lot of ways that's a blast of fresh air, as no doubt an American version wouldn't have been half as biting, daring or dark, and its dedication to probing the unacceptable makes up a large part of Oldboy's character. It's not those stabs outside the boundaries that bothered me about this one, though, so much as it was the refusal to bask in them for more than a few instants before jolting off in search of new depths. The establishing story is almost perfect, setting the stage with an everyman who's been transformed by fifteen years of unexplained imprisonment, then following his violent, dedicated search for both suspect and reason. It's an act the tangled, overstretched follow-through can't hope to match, even when its mysteries and motivations are finally, confusingly, lain bare. Oldboy deserves recognition for its style, demeanor and intense action scenes, but the plot often veers into weirdness and depravity for unclear reasons that don't always benefit the bigger picture.",6.0,12 June 2012

How hard is it to get some fake blood and lame dialogue together and pay off a director to say he liked it at canne? A small note, Just because Quentin Tarentino says it's good does not make it so. The movie simply does not make any sense. I am betting the remake in 2006 will be better but somehow I am really doubting it.

Sublime.,"I don't care if it's (at time of writing) the 73rd best movie of all time. Having seen many a cinematic masterpiece, I can safely say that IT DOES NOT GET BETTER THAN THIS. It's the most incredibly thought-out piece of cinema that I have ever seen. We are shown the right amount of each character to discover their emotions and ultimately who they are without having it spoonfed to us. It's not in your face, it doesn't insult the viewer like that. Everything you see and everything you know about the movie whilst watching it is what you need to know. The violence in this movie is used sparingly and yet feels so real. The hallway fight is where we really feel that we want Oh Dae Su to succeed and the music, setting,characters and buildup are the reason why. But it's clear when the fighting is pointless and at these times it is not present. I have never seen anything closer to a perfect movie nor do I believe I ever will, and whenever asked what the best of all time is, I state that it is this film without hesitation. Watch it.

Lost in Translation or See it Again?,"""Old Boy"" is a damned tough movie to review. Its strengths and its weaknesses seem to become apparent only upon reflection. The disjointed plot is distracting and can lead viewers to lose interest in precisely what is going on. But pay close attention to this one; the pay-off is worth it.

The film's greatest weakness involves poor pacing, slowing to the point of boredom at times before throwing mountains of information at the viewer in a few seconds. But Park Chan Wook is a masterful director on the cutting edge of the new wave of Asian film-making with many important titles to his credit. So perhaps this ""weakness"" is intentional.

""Old Boy"" employs extraordinary cinematography, one of Park's trademarks. When dialogue and plot drag, unique camera angles and unusual presentation keep one's attention. The film starts with great promise. The protagonist, Oh Dae Su, is well-defined and supremely well portrayed by Choi Min Sik. As a viewer, I was compelled to want to go along with Oh Dae Su on his bizarre journey. Its bits of satirical humor generate particular enjoyment. The early escape scenes are superbly presented; I cried out in delight.

Sadly, after the escape, the movie begins to lag. While I was expecting more in the area of Oh Dae Su's revenge (characters utter his name as if it's a horrible invocation), the story instead dives deeply into an uncertain psychological exploration that eventually loses me.

I guess I could say that I just didn't get it and I'm an idiot. But the film IS sophisticated enough to be difficult to tackle. It is quite slick, its performances excellent, its presentation powerful. I just wish I could have followed the complexity of the story as it gained momentum and that the film would not have fallen into near sleep mode at too many important junctures.

In all, the film is a special treat despite its drawbacks. I would venture to say that Korean cinema, and Park in particular, has reached a point similar to that of 20th century Scandinavian, Polish and French cinema in its penchant for decidedly dark (film noir) approaches. ""To hell with any concern that the audience might not be able to follow the story; just do the film."" In this respect, ""Old Boy"" succeeds supremely, although I don't find it as subtly beautiful as, say, ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring."" I suspect Park had that film in mind when he made this film. Similarities in style, such as vast understatement, abound.

""Old Boy"" is original, daring, bizarre and purposefully entertaining. I believe only that the screenplay could have been improved; I will also concede that some vital components may have been ""lost in translation.""",7.0,2 December 2005

Masterpiece,"Masterpiece work of art > Plot, Acting, Directing, and Score.

Amazing plot, after you finish the movie it will leave you thinking for a minute and have an imprint on your mind. Absolutely mastermind of writing. Truly genius. Takes you into an emotional rollercoaster of grief, vengeance, agony, and all.

First, the amount of grudge Woo-Jin had that made him very patient to wait so long for his plot to be successful. As if this is the only way to make him die satisfied. He enjoyed the process and enjoyed the completion of his plan, then died happily (but sad at the same time).

The actors were amazing, i felt anxious throughout the movie and absolutely did not expect that ending. As I said, I stayed there for a while thinking. Also, I have to say the director was absolutely exceptional. Every single shot was a piece of art. Also, the scene where the past at presence were shot at the same time (at the school) was truly a work of art. Throughout the whole movie (as a cinematography fan), I was amazed by the shots and angles of the cinematographer.

Some say there are many unrealistic or extremist parts, yet if you see the whole picture the movie is amazing. The score makes you dive into that anxious and surreal mood.

Its not that bad,"I heard so many people say that Oldboy was such an awful movie. Having watched it though, I found that it actually wasn't that bad. It was like seeing the movie Cube, except the guy gets revenge. Oldboy wasn't exceptionally good, the plot had many holes, and the acting was so-so, except by the main character, Dae-su Oh, played by Min-sik Choi. I guess what did Oldboy in was that there wasn't that much suspense. It doesn't bring you in to want to see who the main character is imprisoned by, or why the he is imprisoned, it instead just shows an angry guy wondering the streets of Korea (with a girl of course), killing people and asking lots of questions. The answers to the questions are slowly revealed, and the by the end everything comes crashing down and you know everything. The entire time watching this movie I was thinking, nice fight scene instead of why did he end up this way.

The tyranny of plot over character.,"This film has no soul. Thats my main problem with the film really. It has no soul. Sure the film looks fantastic, sure it supposedly deals with the often popular and heady subject of revenge in a brash, bold way but it does it in a way that is needlessly gratuitous and wholly sensational. The long, side-scrolling fight scene which is very striking and original is entirely unnecessary and drawn out. A clear cut case of style over substance, which is apparent throughout most of this film. And it suffers heavily from a certain style of writing that seems to be symptomatic of substandard east Asian filmmakers. The idea that drama and powerful film-making are the result of a cumulative effect. That is, if you add enough elements that are recognisably powerful and dramatic, you will end up with a powerful, dramatic film. For example, suicide is very striking and powerful, revenge is dramatic, unrequited love is dramatic, a character unable of feeling human emotions is a powerful statement. The problem is that this film amongst other Asian films (eg. hero, Samaritan girl) tries to imitate truly powerful films, without an understanding of what made those films powerful in the first place, thus creating a dramatic atmosphere by carelessly throwing all these features together without the slightest care for how it effects the characters that it subjects these ""dramatic"" events to. What you are left with are alien characters, that no human being can possibly relate to or comprehend, that have no soul of their own, but are merely devices, allegories and playthings of the sensational directors that use them. In short what you have here, in this highly praised and touted film is the tyranny of plot over character and ultimately the death of character.",4.0,7 October 2006

My God...,"Oldboy is without a doubt the best film I have had the pleasure to have viewed this year, Chan Wook-Park, who remains my favorite director working today has proved himself once again, if not exceeding everything that was expected of this movie.

Based on a very popular Manga, Oldboy was always set to be controversial. Anyone lucky enough to have read the Manga will not have been as shocked/revolted as many of us lucky/unlucky viewers!

Choi Min-Sik proved once again the level of his greatness, out doing all his previous work on such modern day classics as ""Happy End"" and ""Failan""... he is clearly in a league of his own, comparable only to that of Kong Sang-Ho!

The final plot twist is as much unexpected as it devastating, and has left different reactions to each person I have showed it to. My girlfriend just cover her face and whimpered ""Oh my God..."", while my cousin just sat there in silence with his eyes closed... all the way to my uncle who just let out a nervous chuckle. This movie is really one of a kind that will go down in history as the greatest revenge movie ever constructed, unless Chan Wook-Park can pull out something very really special for Sympathy for Mrs. Vengeance... which I doubt he will be able too, best of luck to him though as I'm sure he will not let us down.",,30 May 2004
Not great,"In an age of American cinema where our biggest blockbusters are based on films already successful overseas, this is one movie that needs to be seen by more American movie goers.

He is sudden thrust back into society where he must track down the person that took away his freedom. Along the way come multiple plot twist and surprises that you just don't see coming.

It's a shame so many American film goers refuse to see foreign films, because this movie is genius. Who knows, maybe someday the movie will get remade for audiences here in the U.S. and the main character will be played by Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis. If you want to stay true to the Asian vision, I even think Jackie Chan could be a candidate.",6.0,4 August 2017

Cinematography, editing, performances, character writing or just the brilliant twisted story are absolutly unique. By the way, the thematics and symbolisms of this movie are also highly recommended to any hobby-philosophers. The way how Chan-Wook Park handled the back story of the movie's antagonist, is not only relatable, but also kind of daring. You see his point, although you do not agree with his actions. Oh Dae Sue on the other hand, is a great protagonist. He's got a simple motivation, and is marked by 20 years of isolation, but also possesses some emotional spots and is more vulnerable than ever. The movie has a message and doesn't only rely on it's astounding directing. There a many visual metaphors and it touches on many social-critically questions.

Gripping Revenge Thriller unlike any other,"""Revenge is futile"" is the theme of Old boy, a South Korean movie directed by Chan-Wook Park with Min-SIk Choi as the lead character of the story. It is a dark, twisted masterpiece of revenge fiction with terrifying plot twists.

The story follows Oh Dae-su, as he gets imprisoned for 15 years in a room and is finally released by his captor without any explanation. We are shown the changes brought about in Oh Dae-su over the course of 15 years as he is subjected to routine doses of television, drugs, valium gas and hypnosis. He is suddenly freed after 15 years and we look at a mentally unstable man with vengeance in his heart who sets out to find his captor and kill him. The second part of the movie then follows Oh Dae-su as he tries to find his captor, meeting a beautiful girl (Mido) in the process, and learning the truth about his captivity slowly as he gets closer to his captor. The end is a series of terrifying plot-twists culminating in an intense climax scene.

This movie is a piece of revenge fiction and shows us just how messy revenge can be. ""Revenge begets revenge and this is where the justice system has to step in."" This movie is a study on how horrible and twisted revenge can get and the extents to which vengeful men go to exact revenge on the people they were wronged by. The aftermath of this vengeance-filled story, as we see in the final scene, is tragedy and destruction.

I personally love this movie because of the intensity maintained throughout the movie. The direction is top-notch and a few scenes stand out as highlights with brilliant acting, cinematography and compositions. The plot twists are numerous with each one more sinister than the last and keeps you horribly fascinated at the unfolding of events. The psyches of the different characters are studied in detail as their actions unfold and hurtle towards the climax.

Overall, I would place this movie above other revenge fiction movies like Kill Bill, Count of Monte Cristo as this movie is darker, with more violence, more destruction and more revenge than the rest of them. A must-watch for sure.",9.0,13 November 2016

Nicee,"""Oldboy"" (2003) is a South Korean neo-noir action thriller film directed by Park Chan-wook, based on the Japanese manga of the same name by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiya. The film follows the story of Oh Dae-su, portrayed by Choi Min-sik, a man who is mysteriously imprisoned in a cell for 15 years and then released, seeking revenge against those who orchestrated his captivity.

Park Chan-wook's direction is masterful, blending elements of mystery, suspense, and brutal action to create a dark and compelling narrative. The film's stylish cinematography, inventive camerawork, and intricate plot twists keep viewers on the edge of their seats as they unravel the mystery of Oh Dae-su's imprisonment.

Choi Min-sik delivers a powerhouse performance as Oh Dae-su, capturing the character's rage, anguish, and determination with raw intensity. The film's supporting cast, including Yoo Ji-tae and Kang Hye-jung, also deliver strong performances, adding depth and complexity to the story.

""Oldboy"" is celebrated for its bold storytelling, shocking plot twists, and unforgettable scenes of violence and revenge. It explores themes of redemption, obsession, and the consequences of past actions in a thought-provoking and visually stunning manner.

Upon its release, ""Oldboy"" received widespread critical acclaim and won numerous awards, including the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival.

I did not bother watching the trailer and I read the brief description but I had no idea that it would be such an intense film. Probably what I liked most about it was how the events unfolded and how the suspense was always present. I kept asking myself, ""what's to come now?"" and although some of the turnouts were not entirely believable at times I gave it 9/10 because the acting was impeccable on behalf of the main characters and it was very original (although hard to watch specially nearing the end).

Truly amazing,"OLDBOY is the second installment in Park Chan-wook's 'Vengeance' trilogy.

Oh Dae Su (Choi Min-sik) is a normal guy who lives a normal life with a wife and kid. One night when he gets caught drunk and disorderly, he's kidnapped and imprisoned in a room and is only able to communicate with the outside world by watching the TV that's in his room. One year passes by and still trapped in his room he turns on the TV and watches the news and finds out that his wife has been murdered, making Oh's rage grow and grow. Fourteen years later, he's released and starts to seek for revenge to find the person who stole Oh's fifteen years and murdered his wife. When he's released, he is given a mobile phone, clean clothes and money and meets an attractive young female named Mido (Kang Hye-jeong) who gets caught in Oh's quest for vengeance. But there is one rule in Oh's quest for revenge; the rule is he is only given five days to find his captor and his wife's murderer or else Mido will die.

OLDBOY is an absolute classic tale of the obsession for vengeance and Park Chan-wook has done an incredible job, but it's unfortunate that he didn't get the Palme d'Or at Cannes but at least he got the Grand Prix Prize. I'd highly recommend this movie to those who aren't squeamish, but if you are squeamish, look away because the violence is nasty and quite realistic.",10.0,5 August 2006
Excellent ... Awful.. Terrible,"This is the second in the ""Vengeance trilogy"" by director Park Chan-wook and third of my Korean movie hitch-hike.

This is an excellent movie in many aspects. A dark theme coupled with brilliant acting, direction n production system.

It re-defines the age of dark movies. And yet in spite of all that brilliance, for people like me, It just cannot be watched for a second time... Once you know the story.

""Even though I am no worse than a beast, Don't I have a right to live?"" asks Min-sik Choi in the end.. The question is asked to the audience as well, challenging morality and given as a justification for the lead characters choice...

No matter what the director wants us to believe, I think it's just not conceivable for a father to choose to have physical relation with his daughter, even after knowing that she is his daughter.

This is perhaps the only brilliant movie by which I was awed and yet promised myself not to watch it again.. It disturbs the very fabric of our beliefs and attempts to provide justification for a father - daughter physical relationship...

On the bigger prospective I have developed a definitive respect for Korean cinema.

Not a prison, just a room, with a bed and TV and he receives food. The days turns into years, and after 15 years he is suddenly released. He is given a phone and message on not Why did this happen to him, but Why was he released. Sounds a little daft, but for those who have seen this movie, if you think about it, it makes sense. It is absolutely bizarre and not for the weak hearted. Oldboy had some magnificent violence that was recorded excellent. There is a fight scene, where he takes on 15 guys on his own in a hallway.

I can't say it isn't a poor movie, cos it's brilliant. It's smart, it's powerful, it's in your face. It just isn't what I expected, and it sure left that heavy feeling in my head for a few days following the movie.

giving Tatantino a run for his money,"Amazing film. I visited Korea for the first time this year. As the country, Korean films are different from what you have seen and what you have experienced from a Western perspective. This movie has a subject that starts like a Kafka story of an individual facing an unknown repressive machine, but turns quickly in a sordid and personal revenge run that would be worth of the hand of Tarantino. I am sorry to use Western cultural references, but this is the best way to describe my impressions. There is actually much more deepness, a troubling, shocking but yet so human story beyond the action story line. There are tons of graphic violence and some sex, but they did not seem shocking to me because they were very much in the logic of the story. Acting is superb, and the story line, including the ending is perfectly logic. I am hearing that Hollywood intents to do a re-make and I fear the results. But maybe they can convince Tarantino himself to do it! One of the best films of the year to end, 9 out of 10 on my personal scale.",9.0,17 December 2004
Unconventional Love Story,"The love story, it seems, will continue to be told as long as we can tell it and in as many ways as we want. This is why OLDBOY is so refreshing; it takes liberty with as many cinematic elements it can hold from across the spectrum of action, drama and comedy without presenting another typified movie. Conservatives beware, your social mores are not taken into consideration here (nor should they). What really got my attention were the impressively long shots that intensified the action on screen by being in real time; no quick cut cheats here. Without giving away the plot (because I really hate when someone can't tell me about a movie without giving me a synopsis of the thing), OLDBOY is quite simply one of those contemporary movies that puts almost everything I've seen to shame. Imagine America's best movie-making innovators and take away the restrictions that our tight-ass MPAA place on them...you would get films like these; actual pieces of art.",10.0,23 October 2006
The 2nd greatest film of all time.,"What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? After being kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years, a man is released, only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days. Number 2 sees a controversial choice: a film that has in fact been passionately set on fire with denouncement by a number of critics. Nonetheless, what I find in Oldboy is comfort of a strange kind. What Park Chan-wook creates in his twisted and surreal world is an untouchable empathetic consistency. The protagonist, named Oh Dae-su (Min Sik-choi), is quite frankly the most three dimensional, intriguing, inspiring and hard-hitting character ever to grace the screen. His conduct is real yet fantastic, defiant yet compassionate. Aside from Oh Dae-su's remarkable and unmatchable persona, sweetly showcased by his narration of the taxonomy of rock bream whilst indifferently wearing a stolen pair of women's sunglasses, or as he walks away, undisturbed by the suicide-by-falling of a man he has just told his story to, and what this brings to not just the film as a whole but its ability to connect with a certain breed of audience, the directing is arguably flawless. If one only has five minutes to spare, I recommend taking what could just be the most impressive scene of stature and presence in the history of cinema: the corridor fight scene, shot over four days (it is a continuous one take with only correction of punches comprising the totality of the computer editing intervention), where we are shown a trademark of the calibre of filmmaking that Oldboy contains. I've never seen anything like it. I watch it again and again, dumbstruck to its perfection, as composer Jo Yeong-wook's magnificent and moving score sombrely serenades over the visuals. Oldboy touches on some controversial and taboo subjects which deter the average viewer, but to the trained eye what Park has done with them is to create a piece of cinema that rip-roaringly strips back the layers of the heart to ultimate bareness, whilst still including some of the best action shots in any film to date. Oh Dae-su's tormented soul, battered and bruised both physically and mentally throughout, compliments the captured transition of his mental state into a 'monster' as well as the finest white wine with fish. Lee Woo-jin's distress, his patience and craftsmanship of a bizarrely pleasurable witty kind of sociopathic torture is portrayed with uncompromising genius: studying the sheer power of the final scenes in his penthouse and his ultimate relinquish into decline is taxing and infesting. Many cast Oldboy aside as a publicity stunt, and fail to see past the octopus. What I'm trying to say, in the end, is that Oldboy earns its place as the second greatest film ever made because of how is depicts the depth that human emotion can delve to.",10.0,11 February 2014
This movie will impact your brain,"yes, i like directors who can play with your brain in ways that you can never imagine, this happens clearly in this excellent movie, with a story that no one could imagine how will develop, and with a notable performance by the leading actor.

I did not know much about Korean cinema, but after seen this movie I think that I will put more attention to the films that are coming from that country. The art direction is also unusual for films like one would consider to be horror ones, but that is not the case for old boy, it has a lot of art in its darkness exploration of human soul.

Even more scary than I thought!,"I remember when I saw this movie for the first time, and I thought the idea of a man being locked away for 15 years without being found, to be a little too incredible after all. After learning about the Kampusch-case of Austria I just realized that it was all too possible. It made me think even more clear when I re-watched OLDBOY, about how scary and unnervingly nasty a movie it is! No one deserves what these characters goes through.

But it is a very masterful movie too. The director makes the very fine achievement to make us care for the prisoner, who is a really amoral jerk before he is kidnapped. But he gain quite a lot humanity while being in the abnormal imprisonment. It is not as well done as MR VENGEANCE though! The villain in OLDBOY is a sick bastard beyond comprehension, and he for one sort of deserve an ill faith.",,18 August 2008
"""You can't find the right answer if you ask the wrong questions.""","A man (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and imprisoned for fifteen years without knowing why or who is behind it. He is then mysteriously released and given clothes, money, and a cell phone. He sets out to try and find answers so he can get revenge on who imprisoned him.

It's a good film but perhaps not as great as it's made out to be. The plot is riddled with contrivances and holes. So try to turn your brain off or else you won't enjoy it as much. Also, and I can't stress this enough, the plot twist to this film is big so please stop reading about it until you have seen it. It's like knowing nothing about The Sixth Sense and trying to read info on it. The odds are 100 to 1 the film's twist will be spoiled for you.

South Korea's Violent Masterpiece?,"After being kidnapped and imprisoned for fifteen years, Oh Dae-Su is released, only to find that he must discover the reason for his capture in five days.

I am a bit surprised to find this film in the top 250. Not that it is not a good film (it is), but it does not seem like the sort of thing that would get the honor. I suppose, certain plot elements aside, it has incredible cinematography (both in movement and color) and excellent directing. The acting is fine, as well.

The violence is hard to categorize. On one hand, some of the bloodiest scenes call to find the films of Takashi Miike. But Miike lacks a certain sensibility that Park does not -- this may be a revenge film, but it is also beautiful in a way. The violence, at times, comes off like a well-scripted choreography. Where Miike tries to shock the audience and push the limits, Park seems content to stay just on the edge and make sure it is done in good form.

The biggest problem with this film is that it suffers from the same issue that ""The Sixth Sense"" did. While ""Oldboy"" has many twists and surprises, one of them will probably be told to a viewer before he or she watches the movie. And that is unfortunate. Does it ruin the movie to know twists in advance? Maybe not. But it might be best to have things revealed as the story intends them to be.

All in all, a solid film. If I had any complaint, I could say the film was a bit long. But the pacing was steady, so it was not an unenjoyable longness. Not for all audiences, this film should be seen by those who can appreciate it.",8.0,28 December 2011

Manga comics do not a good film make,"Oldboy has a wonderful setup for a revenge film, it is on par with the Count of Monte Cristo. While the main character was imprisoned I was transfixed. Who was doing this too him? Why? I was ready to be shown a good revenge film. What I got was a convoluted mess.

I loved the first half of the film. Once the main character was released from a suitcase, wearing a particularly cool suit, I was fully expecting a tale of violence and revenge. Justified revenge. I knew they would throw somethings at me, but I wasn't expecting gibberish.

This is the second Asian film this year that screwed up a wonderful set-up, the other being Infernal Affairs. For the whole last hour the viewer is bombarded with illogical plot devices, twists that have no real meaning either to plot or as a parable to the viewer, all stables of Manga, that do not translate well to film. Asian cinema does not like to paint characters with the sides of good and bad. The heroes are sometimes worse than the villains, they usually have something seriously wrong with them, either mentally or morally.

Many of the criticisms regarding this film come from viewers who are blinded by the conventions of Western Cinema. I was not expecting it to be a conventional film, where revenge is reaped with no sacrifice to the protagonist. I was expecting destruction and madness. The conclusion however is neither of those. I don't know what it is, it just is what it is. It cannot be satisfying to anybody, even to those expecting a un-satisfying conclusion.",3.0,20 September 2005
Profound exploration of the human condition,"Oldboy is not merely a movie; it's a profound exploration of the human condition, a testament to the power of storytelling, and a reminder of cinema's ability to push boundaries.

It's exploration of the human psyche under extreme circumstances. The protagonist is thrust into a nightmarish odyssey of vengeance and self-discovery.

As the layers of the story are peeled away, the audience is forced to confront the dark recesses of human nature, questioning the limits of revenge and the fragility of one's sanity.

My favorite movie,"Yes, I'm going to go ahead and say that this is my favorite movie. Take that as a bias for this review, or take it as an endorsement, it's up to you.

First off, as you've probably read, if you're interested in the US remake, watch the original. I'm not saying you should watch the original first or second, or to skip the US version, I'm just saying you should watch the original whenever. It's better than the remake, regardless of the order that you watch them. There is a desperation in the main character of the original version that is lost in the remake, and to me, that desperation was the driving force behind the plot.

While spending his time locked up, you get to see Dae-su go through all the stages of grief. But the difference is that the final stage, acceptance, has a different effect on him in that he becomes almost empty. I used the word desperation before because he becomes a man who has nothing to live for except revenge. While the hallway scene may seem ridiculous on paper, I had no trouble believing it when I first watched the movie. In other movies, his actions would be those of a man possessed, but Oldboy is about a man who has suffered, was hollowed out, and no longer knows fear.

Chan-wook Park is an amazing writing and director. I wish I knew more about film theory so I could explain the various ways he makes this film spectacular. The most important thing to me is how he conveys emotion. Even watching it with subtitles, you'll understand the characters' plights. On top of all that, the twists and turns are completely unexpected assuming you haven't seen the remake or the ripoff ""The Samaritan"".

If you're like me, after watching this, you'll go out and find the rest of Chan-wook Park's library.",10.0,17 April 2014
The Movie that got me into Asian Cinema,"I've always enjoyed watching movies, going to the movies, renting a movie now and then (until it got out of fashion). But I never really looked for interesting, awesome movies to watch that might not have the PR reach to get my attention. I always left it up to Hollywood to decide for me what ""good"" movies I get to watch. That changed with Oldboy. By some stroke of luck I got to see this movie with a friend about 10 years ago. We watched it again, right after. I've seen it over 10 times by now and it was an entertaining watch (at the least) every time. I told myself, if there where movies made by Asians out there, THIS GOOD, then I can't just sit by and not watch them. I got off my lazy ass and searched the Internet from top to bottom and I've been rewarded greatly. While I still enjoy South Korean Cinema the most, Oldboy has made way for me to discover some of the best I've seen from Japanese and Chinese movie makers. And none of it was or will ever be marketed in the western hemisphere. So, watch this, revel in its glory and go forth to find others of its caliber. IMDb is your greatest ally in this endeavor.

"Wow, simply wow","It's a COMPLETE movie!

It really has everything. Normally when you see such a great storyline in a movie, the director focuses only on that. Because it speaks for itself. Its risky to put your money in such a movie, because you don't know how the movie is gonna come out. And thats the reason why you don't find people who give you a lot of money to make such a movie in the first place.

Oldboy is an exception. Either they got the money they wanted, or they used the little money very smart. Because this movie really is great in every possible way. Storyline, as I said before. Script! Cinematography! Acting! You even have Action-Scenes, and not only some action, but the best uncut fighting scene I've ever seen. And I'm not even a fan of those kinda scenes, but in this movie I loved it. Oh, the soundtrack ""the last waltz"", simply fantastic.

I don't know how successful this movie was, but Im sure that, would it have been a Hollywood-movie with some famous actors, it would have been one of the most successful movies ever.

Anyway, I can only praise this movie and envy those who made it.",10.0,29 January 2012
Korean's finest,"Oldboy was the first Korean horror/thriller (or of any genre at all really) I had ever seen and the exceptional films which followed (Sympathy For Lady Vengeance, The Chaser etc.) could not beat the masterpiece that is Oldboy. Unfortunately I can't say that it still remains that way because last year I saw I Saw the Devil which is one of the greatest films I've ever seen and surpassed Oldboy, but not by a lot. Oldboy is a phenomenal achievement. From its directing, to its acting, to the unpredictable and frankly genius writing. It's a masterpiece and one which is not hard to forget.

The story is absolutely horrible and it pulls on my heart strings more every time I watch it! It's thoroughly gripping right from its brilliant opening shot, as it tells the story of a man imprisoned in a room for 15 years. It's difficult to comprehend and you'd be a robot if you didn't feel for the man! You might think that watching a man in a room for 15 minutes would be really boring, but Park (the director, not a park) manages to keep the most boring situation absolutely thrilling and a visual feast. We really get into Oh Dae Su's mind-set as we see his schizophrenic symptoms of ants crawling out of his skin. It's incredibly intense and your willing for him to escape.

Of course he's subjected to even more psychological torture when he is freed as he has to find out who is kidnapper is, but more importantly why he was kidnapped. Oldboy isn't so much of a who's dunnit, but a why's dunnit which is what makes every frame so gripping. Unfortunately most films which are set-up like this as one big build up rely on a breath-taking finale and reveal, but fail to deliver, take Knowing for example. You don't need to worry about this with Oldboy as it features one of the greatest and most compelling finales ever! The screenplay is endlessly intelligent and imaginative, creating a multi-layered story with characters you can really feel for. What makes Oldboy so great is that you can actually sympathise with the 'villain' of the tale and sometimes condemn the heroe's actions.

The three dimensional characters are breath of fresh air, compared to the 2D kids we often get. Oldboy isn't just great because of its ending, the journey getting there is equally as breath-taking and involving. Oldboy features one of the greatest fight scenes in film history and is sure to be engraved in your mind. I'd put it up there with the crazy 88 fight scene in Kill Bill, it's just a technical marvel. It's also just one example of Park's phenomenal directing. It's incredibly stylish as well as evoking the character's feelings. At first Oh Dae Su is just a vengeful maniac, but then he becomes more and more human as we find out things about him which I won't spoil.

In the end Oldboy is a masterpiece. It's obvious that Park was a former philosophy student as the film contains so many provoking dilemmas. Not only is it a gritty revenge thriller, but it also has a huge heart and a massive emotional impact. The wondrous music also acts as another character in the film! By the end of it Oldboy will have you submitting to its knees in a puddle of tears with its cruel, but admirable finale. I can't see the American remake being any where near this standard. Make sure you see this, before you see that one!",10.0,7 December 2012

Slow Poison to your veins....,"The brutal expression of this complex plot is what makes this movie a masterpiece. Chan Wook Park's latest installment of his Revenge series is clearly a work of superior art. The real winner here are the makers of the movie, the direction, cinematography, music, actors , their performance is immense and simply brilliant. The plot is complex but revolves around the life of Oh Dae Su getting abducted and locked in a prison for 15 years for no reason whatsoever. Then one day just like 15 years earlier he is released for one reason, to find he was locked. The rest of the movie shows how he achieves this and what are the twist and turns to achieve the same. The people who he meets during this time are really the real bearers of this story and the uniform brilliance in acting really makes the whole time spent on the movie worthwhile. The movie is very stylish, very graphic with blood and gore, very touchy on some I think this masterpiece is not given enough recognition over other similar movies. I hope this movie is never remade in any language since the subtle brilliance will definitely be lost in translation. I heard a Indian Crap was made lifting the story from OldBoy but we can blindly ignore the movie knowing nothing will even come close to the real masterpiece. This is deservedly in the Top movies in IMDb and should stay there forever.

Oh Boy!,"""Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep and you weep alone.""

Never have truer words been said. And I agree with the second part even more. This is a film where the hero and the villain are both lonely individuals because they're in a grieving process. But you can't be truly heroic or villainous when you're that pathetic, so ""Old Boy"" is less the tale of an upcoming good-vs-evil confrontation than the journey of a man who was stolen part of his life and had the remains to give it the only possible meaning: knowledge first, then revenge.

I won't spoil the twist, one brilliant paradigm the film provides is that sometimes it's not about looking for the right answers but asking the right questions. But I'm talking in abstractions, let's just get into reviewing mode. Oh-Daeh Su is a man we first see drunk in a police station, he missed his daughter's birthday and is ready to go home when he's suddenly kidnapped and jailed in an apartment where he's given food, clean laundry and a TV as his only connection to the world, like Peter Sellers' character in ""Being There"".

TV teaches him one thing or two when the rest of the experience hardens him. At that moment we're hooked already, we want to see his escape and want to know what this average-looking man ever did to deserve this? The way he ""gets off"" is an indicator that the film isn't exactly trying to match our expectations. Indeed, it's not as simple because it's much simpler than we'd have anticipated, he's released and finds himself with new clothes, a cellphone, and time to readapt to the city he left.

There's even a scene that echoes ""Being There"" where he's confronted to street thugs, Oh Daeh-Su says ""Can 10 years' worth of imaginary training... be put to use?"" Apparently it can, and his fifteen years of isolation improved his physical skills as much as they damaged the social ones. Yet, everything feels too convenient, too weird, even in a restaurant, a young girl named Mido seems to grow an infatuation on him... even after he did the grossest thing ever; eating a live octopus! Is the film falling in the romance trap? Wait till the end, that's not the right question to ask.

Now why did he eat the animal? That's a question. ""To feel something alive in his mouth after having been deprived from life"" seems like an organic answer, remember that Oh Daeh-Su has been totally desensitized from life and naturally pain, taking the life out of an animal or a human being would make him feel alive again as if he had sucked the juice of life to feel something again.

The ""octopus"" scene sets our mind to the most gruesome parts where Oh Daeh-Su tracks down his captors until he finds his former warden and pulls seven teeth out before getting the names. All the discretion shots in the world can't distract from disturbing ""Marathon Man"" vibes but here again, it's not just about shocking for the kicks. When Oh Daeh-Su pulls off the tooth, believe it or not, he's the one suffering, he's the one who has surrendered to his bestial nature to commit atrocities he never thought he could.

As he says: ""Even though I'm no more than a monster - don't I, too, have the right to live?"" And living, as far as he's concerned, is looking for the answers, there's something worse than suffering which is suffering for no reason, this could apply for violence in films, it can only work if there's a reason. So for a film so inclined to disturbing acts of violence, it's interesting that its central theme is knowledge.

The film puts us in the mind of someone who wants to know but maybe the truths it's ready to reveal would make his torment worse, his life more hellish, but he's willing to take the risk... this is why you can't judge the film without considering its antagonist. Woo Jin-Lee is everything Oh Daeh-Su is not, he's handsome (very actually), rich, confident and he defines himself as a scholar in Oh Daeh-Su. So we have the man who wants to know and the scholar.

And as the cat-and-mouse chase goes on and the plot gets thicker, Woo Jin-Lee's cool and detached demeanor fades out to unveil as tragic depths as Oh Daeh-Su did so we understand that they were the perfect match to each other until the climactic face-off. And like Bill in ""Kill Bill"", it's not just black and white morality. I know, you could see a ""Kill Bill"" allusion coming, there are so many parallels to draw between the two films and it's a fitting coincidence that QT was the Cannes Festival and gave the film its Grand Prize, but ""Old Boy"" flies high miles above American Cinema.

Indeed, calling it a revenge story, an action film or a psychological thriller wouldn't give you one tenth of the idea. American movies have proven that a good editing, a compelling story and shocking value are integral to a film's success but I blame them for having given me the wrong idea about that South Korean's gem, perhaps one of the most immoral and amoral movies I've ever seen, it's just disturbing, disgusting and graphic on levels rarely reached by American cinema (Tarantino included)... on the surface.

Indeed, it's impossible to give ""Old Boy"" a negative review. The reason is simple, the film is amoral but it's a masterpiece of amorality, it embraces it with a sort of morbid enthusiasm whose credibility depends on its sincerity, whoever uses violence can atone with it. Yes, the film is extreme but if it wasn't, we would feel either manipulated or cheated and the film might show revenge as something necessary but never satisfactory!",10.0,14 March 2019

YES IT IS THAT GOOD,"After getting out of a hotel room like prison a man searches for answers and revenge. The description is simple, direct and probably the best way to explain this great film. Its not that a more detailed recounting of the plot would ruin it like say the Sixth Sense, or The Village, rather its simply that the plot is so layered that to know more simply may result in too much confusion.

Containing a central performance that is simply one of the best performances of the last five or ten years this film is Oscar worthy from top to bottom, which is a shame since as of this writing the film has not yet been released in the United States where it would undoubtedly blow away almost any film it comes in contact with. Ultimately it is better than even the Michael Moore film it lost to at Cannes.

Please...,"I've seen reviews on this place that absolutely does not do the movie justice, accusing it of carrying no real message nor having any coherence at all.

While indeed Oldboy carries no philantrophic messages that make you walk out of your door an inspired man to make the world a better place, the storyline is amazingly well-crafted. While this may be the contribution of the manga it was based on, I believe the director and screenplay writers deserve part of the credit to as to why the story worked so well for a movie.

The director doesn't treat the audience as a dumb customer who paid eight bucks to sit down and get fed with Hollywood table scraps. He drops seemingly random lines that make sense later on, with the unveiling of the plot, step by step, graciously. Whereas some lambast this movie for being nothing more than a movie trying to be artsy and violent at the same time, I seriously don't find this movie as violent as claimed.

This is the part where the explanation that the plot has no coherence fails. People compare this with sixth sense and seven and commented that it lacks coherency and sound sense. I beg to differ. If you're too dumb to pick up the clues and hints of the movie, perhaps your brain is the one which lacks coherence.

The fight scenes in this movie are brief but pleasant. There's no fancy martial arts, slow-motion clichés that the movie industry seemingly enjoy so much nowadays. Very well shot too, not the best fight scenes ever shot in movie industry but very well done.

The dialogues are clever and witty, with a slightly dark sense of humour. Very enjoyably so and the deliverance of these lines feel very natural and flows well with the movie, you don't get that feeling where it seems like the characters are saying it just for the sake of looking cool and badass on their screen time.

There is some fight action in the film, but none of the wire-aided flying garbage that has come to represent so much of the Asian films of the last decade. The cinematography is very good, there is a lot of very dark humor scattered throughout, and the story is convoluted enough to leave even the wisest cinema buff guessing what the outcome will be.

Ad Nauseam,"Oldboy is a Korean film, so it has the Hong Kong feel, but there's something different to it as well. There is a feel of film noir, but it's also got quirky humor and the obligatory kung fu scenes (although not extended). The story begins with the protagonist being abducted and imprisoned for 15 years. When he gets out, he must follow the clues to find out why he was there. Things get really weird and really twisted.

What I thought about it: I really can't say anything about the over-dubbing that was sub-par because it's to be expected from foreign films. Of course when I turned on the subtitles, it didn't match the dialog - it seems as if the subtitles was a direct translation and the dubbing was a cultural equivalent with artistic freedom. It distracted me, so I turned it off. The acting might have been believable in Korean, but without actually hearing the actors' voices it was laughably bad - like some of the people you see on American Idol who put too much into their singing where it sounds ridiculous and not natural at all. The dialog and soliloquy were filled with pop-culture hackery. ""Laugh and the world laughs with you..."" and other stolen lines repeated ad nauseam trying to fill the story with philosophy, yet ultimately adding nothing to the story artistically or dramatically. Of course the twists, turns and revelations are all pretty original, yet it ends with the dreaded deus ex machina.

In conclusion, this isn't a movie I'd necessarily recommend to anyone unless you're interested in foreign films, Korean camp, or if you like movies that take you one way to throw you another when it all fits together.",3.0,14 August 2006
One star?,"Come on men what's wrong with you? I understand you may not your fit your deep intellectual standards but is it that bad? In the world I live if I pick a random movie it will be, with great chance, worst that Old Boy. I really don't understand what offended so much the people that rated this film less than six stars out of ten. Honestly this is a well told story. Unrealistic or even stupid if you want; but well told.

On the other side what's up with people complaining about the complexity of the plot. If you know how to read subtitles, the plot is explained almost entirely by the words of the characters (Star Wars is a hard to follow story then). I mean, there are very good movies out there for witch I'm not even sure there's what you call a plot.

Violence? Well if you're very sensitive it's OK; rate this with one star, alone with 90% of Hollywood's productions of course. Gore? Come on! Harder stuff has been shown time before.

Now seriously IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, I recommend to do so (specially if you haven't seen other Korean films). It's very entertaining, fresh and well crafted. It won't change your life but I'm sure you'll have a good time and a good memory of the movie.

Utterly watchable...,"This is one great movie: hip, violent and thoroughly compelling. Despite the unjustified and totally lame criticism of this movie by a whining buffoon below me, this movie brings an added welcome to the sea of crap that have been coming out in recent years. I don't always agree with Tarantino's assessment of films that he likes, but on his praise of this filmI am in total accord.

I will not belabor the reader with a synopsis of this movie since others below me have done a good job of describing the premise of this film. However, I should mention that this film is deftly handled both visually and story-wise. Every scene and frame evidences painstaking care and consideration, even though the film as a whole is fast-paced. The choreographed action scenes are thoroughly refreshing and totally original. I just loved this film.

Like some of the other great directors coming out of Asia, the director of this film should definitely be on the watchlist.

Fantastic!,"Oldboy is simply one of the greatest thrillers ever made, and one of the finest films of the last 20 years. It is the rare film that ignites furious conversations and debate after a screening, and it's impact is felt for weeks after the initial viewing. Mr. Park takes his sadistic tale of revenge from Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and multiplies its brutality to the 10th degree. It is not an easy film to sit through by any means, but when the credits roll at the end, you feel as though black is white, left is right, and day is night. The villain in the film is one of the most sadistic characters to ever appear on screen, and I would he think he even gives Hannibal Lecter chills. This tale of revenge goes places that no American made film today would dare to dream to even get close to, and its slice of ultra-violence delivers more than anything Kill Bill dared to serve. This one is a must see; it is the rare perfect movie.",10.0,31 August 2006
A VISUAL AND EMOTIONAL TOUR DE FORCE,"Chan-Wook Parks follow up to 'Sympathy for Mr Vengeance' is a powerful ride through the mind of an unstable and vengeful kidnapping victim. The film follows our protagonist after he has been locked up for 15 years for completely unknown reasons and with no idea who did it to him. He receives a mobile phone, some money and begins to unravel the twists and turns of this unique and superbly designed revenge movie. The scenes of violence, further between than you may have been lead to believe, upset and humour in equal measure and the films powerful finale shocks and enlightens in equal measure. This is a tough one to follow, it requires the up most attention but rewards greatly for those who follow it every step of the way. The shocking octopus scene needs to be seen to be believed and if you see one film this year make it 'Oldboy', you will not regret it.",,31 August 2004
Asian Trash Cinema Has Become Respectable,"One of the Reasons Film Geeks like Tarantino Gravitated to and Revel in Asian Trash Cinema is that the Oriental Mind-Set does not Feel Comfortable in the West and therefore Their Movies are Off Center and ""Foreign"", Cultish and Creative in a way that can Never be Accomplished on the Home Front.

Stunning Revenge Cinema,"This was the first piece of South Korean cinema I ever saw. In fact outside of Kung Fu films, with the exception of Battle Royal, Id never ventured into Asian cinema before, I now know this is a big mistake, because of films out there like Oldboy. Its opened me up to new tastes and this still as to be my favourite film of the last couple of years.

Oldboy is about a Kafka-esquire antagonist, Dae-su Oh, who is being punished, for no reason he can comprehend. And the desperation he feels as he lurches to find out why and who is behind his suffering is pretty intense. All the way through the film he his latching on to the remotest of clues in the hope of catching his nemesis, but his rival as a few tricks up his sleeve. All pushing towards a conclusion with more than a few twists and an ending which is both disturbing, but reassuring given the circumstance.

The acting and visuals are excellent. I can appreciate people taking apart the story, it doesn't flow and probably isn't as logical as it could be, but with something this good you can sidestep some of your criticisms in favour of enjoying something so primitive and tragic, as a story about revenge.",10.0,21 April 2006
orchestrated like Vivaldi's dramatic 4 seasons with raw power,"Oldboy is with out a doubt the most confronting film I have ever seen. The film is completely devoid of any comic relief or sentimentality. The exterior of Oldboy may at first seem convoluted and bombarded with cliché's however the interior of Oldboy is in fact the film's saving Grace. Various people will perceive Oldboy as your typical revenge movie that utilizes gratuitous violence as a tool for entertainment purposes, it is in fact completely in contrast to that, Oldboy is a heart rendering study of a man's burning desire to get both redemption and satisfaction no matter how drastic his methods may be. Occasionally the film's protagonist crosses the fine line between extremity and malevolence and although you don't condone his actions you can certainly comprehend why he does it. My favorite film of 2005, Chanwook Park has produced a film that is beautifully paced with flawless performances especially from Min-Sik Choi and a refreshing script, all of which is orchestrated at the hands of a cinematic maestro.",10.0,16 September 2006
What if a David Lynch Film Were Coherent?,"I was shocked when I watched ""Oldboy"" on DVD.

The movie was really well filmed, acted, written, and scored. It kept me guessing until the very end. When the ending came, it took me completely by surprise. I could not have guessed the ending in a million years.

""Oldboy"" is not for the squeamish or for people looking for light entertainment. This movie makes you think about the characters and the story. You need to pay close attention because seemingly unimportant things end up being vital to the plot. It is extremely violent at times.

It is like a David Lynch film in that it is really strange and grotesque but unlike David Lynch, the ending explains everything.

The DVD defaults to English dubbing, which is not very good. I recommend watching it in the original language with subtitles.

""Oldboy"" is my favorite foreign language film of all time! If you like good, original storytelling and are not squeamish, you might like ""Oldboy.""",10.0,26 August 2006
Art work should be rated what it deserves. Please no prejudice or stereotypes.,"I don't wanna mention about the plot or how great Oldboy is. A lot of people mentioned it here and most people understand this movie well and they vote properly.

But, before you criticized the movie, you have to open your mind for the different cultures and different thinking. You have to understand the whole story and hidden cultural background first before you criticize it. You should concern the missing part by mistranslation or different languages.

Some of people rated this as 1 or 2 out of 10. Some of people criticized about extreme violence and blamed Asian culture as crazy culture. That's the nonsense. Kill Bill, Saving Private Ryan, Godfather and some of excellent movie has a lot of violence. So, you wanna rate those 1 out of 10? ""The Silence of the Lambs"" contains cannibalism. You wanna say all Americans are cannibal? Eating living octopus or fish, it's quite common in Japan and Korea. Movie just use extreme expression for explain the emotion of leading character.

Welcome to Korea !!,"This movie is very hard to describe without going into the plot of the movie. It is very much a tapestry. If I start to unravel just one strand, it may destroy the tapestry. The main character, Dae-Su, after a night of drinking and being held in custody of the police, suddenly disappears on his way home. For the next 15 years he is imprisoned (not in a typical prison), with his sole companion being TV. The rest of the story revolves around the whos and whys of what happened to him. The story is complicated and twisted, yet very compelling. For the duration of the movie I could not look away, completely captivated by the story (and waiting for it to unravel). The cinematography and soundtrack is simply stunning. My favorite scene has to be his return of the place of his incarceration (especially the hallway fight scene - reminded me of many side-scrolling video games). The fight scenes are not martial arts masterpieces, but rather realistic throw-downs (I especially like the use of a simple hammer). The only draw back is that I wish I knew Korean such that I could understand the making of featurettes (and get a better understanding of the movie).",9.0,16 August 2004
"A Cinematic Masterpiece, Neglected by the Academy","Oldboy is arguably the greatest film of the past decade, a masterpiece of writing, characterization, and cinematography that was ignored by the Academy Awards because it was made in Korea. Director Park Chan-wook takes what could have been a standard revenge plot and expands it into an intelligent, disturbing exploration of the nature of vengeance.

The film follows the vengeful quest of Oh Dae-Su, a man imprisoned for fifteen years by an unknown individual. When he is suddenly freed, he tries to find out who did this and kill him, only to learn that revenge can be a trap in its own right.

A number of factors make this film a masterpiece. Perhaps the most striking of these is its cinematography. The climactic scene in the villain's penthouse is beautifully shot, with excellent lighting and camera work. However, the film's acting is also a major factor. Ji-Tae Yu, who plays Woo-Jin, provides an excellent performance and should have been at least nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Park Chan-wook, the director, was similarly slighted.

The main reason I suspect this film was neglected by the Academy was that it came from a foreign country, in particular one not traditionally seen as a producer of Oscar caliber pictures. American viewers have until recently neglected Korean cinema, with the end result that the film did not get its fair share of attention. Hopefully, the efforts of talented directors such as Park will change this attitude.",,11 May 2010

Critic vs. ?,"Oldboy is not for everyone. For those of us that have seen it, it's extreme in every sense, including talent and direction. Being loosely based on a popular Japanese manga, the film evolves into something completely else as the movie progresses both in time and content. The opening scene is Dae-su holding a depressed and deranged man by the tie on the roof of some tall apartment building, however the story doesn't actually start from there, the film shows us the progression of Dae-su's character up to that point in a believable manner. Granted, the time changes are not like say, 21 Grams but definitely pace back and forth through stylish editing but more importantly the progression of the potential mystery. Chan Park uses his choice of wide shots, as well as extreme closeups, unusual but impressive angle choices, some of which are obscure. And he pays an awful amount of attention to color schemes and set design. Lighting is far beyond most Hollywood films and his mastery of tone control for the movie is excellent. And the acting is simply amazing.

That said, the film is not perfect. It will never be part of Time Magazine's top 100 films but there are no obvious directorial flaws in it. If one suggests a disapproval, that is exactly what it is, a difference of opinion. Chan Wook Park has style, it's just a matter of whether that will float your boat or whatever, sink it. The last reviewer described the film as being a waste of time and tried to point out what were apparently close connections to Ichi the Killer. Well, I couldn't disagree with you more, Miike is an exhibitionist and nothing more, his films never peak past interesting. Miike also makes sometimes several films a year, none of which show any growth, all proving to reflect very little style. Where Chan Wook Park tells you a story with obvious character development (mind you, he does it with stylish techniques), Miike wants to disturb you like a bully, never really working out more than a sigh from me and I can only assume that a real film critic would agree. There are stylish directors out there that I won't fanboy myself over but can respect, Tony Scott and maybe ever Gasper Noe (probably not), but their style is all integrated into storytelling, Miike never does and probably never will...it's quite obvious whose film was the best in the Three Extremes. I promise you folks, don't pick up Oldboy, that is not what I am saying...what I suggest is you rent it immediately if you want to see something vividly entertaining, stylish and good.

"First of all, why the 2008-scheduled remake? Why?!","I try not to hate the idea of remaking films, especially since it does not detract anything from the legacy of the original film  but remaking 'Oldboy' strikes me as a puzzling move by Hollywood. The film is not good enough to merit a rehash and it is not bad enough to merit 'let's do better than this' jabs.

Chan-wook Park's notoriously violent revenge-movie proved a polarizing force upon release. On the one hand, it received the Palme D'or in Cannes 2004 and was crowned 'best movie of the year' by many teenage boys while on the other hand, audiences panned it for its weak pay-off. I am hesitant to join either camp, although I must say there are many things about Oldboy that jump out and grab you: the squid-eating scene, the pensive flashbacks, the gruesome torture scenes and the twist ending.

Yet the story is Oldboy's primary export and its mysterious unfolding keeps you on the edge of your seat. Ladiesman Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) is suddenly kidnapped one day and jailed in a seedy hotel-room like compartment  for fifteen years. There is a bed, a desk, a bathroom cubicle and a TV, the latter acting as the only refuge for Dae-su. Here the film offers an unflinching look at how insanity sweeps across the tiny cell and into the lonely mind of our protagonist, who screams, beats his fists bloody into the wall and watches yet more TV. His narration to us keeps him sane, and keeps us up to date on how his thoughts are racing. Does someone have it in for him? Is this an elaborate experiment? Is revenge more important than the truth? All questions and no answers. ""You can't find the right answer,"" his jailer tells him when the spell of isolation is broken, ""...if you ask the wrong questions.""

When one day Dae-su Oh is inexplicably released by his unknown jailers, he naturally pends between anguish, rage and befuddlement with violent fits. Oldboy plunges into thoughts of vengeance that snap and crackle like kindling in a fireplace and director Chan-wook Park becomes ambitious, steering his film onto different paths. He uses a broad spectrum of emotion, action, mystery and suspense to accompany the dizzying story and also blends in some dark humour with deft, creative writing strokes. In other words, Oldboy cannot quite decide what it wants to be. With a seemingly extra-template love storyline courtesy of the young girl Mi-do who takes the maladapted Dae-su Oh in, it boldly defies categorization, tipping over into romance territory. Mi-do inhabits a crucial role in the story of 'Oldboy', but this only becomes apparent in the end and in the rest of the film she feels like a redundant, one-dimensional and stereotypical love interest inclusion. Apparently Hollywood is not alone in crafting characters like this.

Nevertheless, I like the look of the film and I like the grainy image it projects. The vast majority of Oldboy is filtered through a grayish kaleidoscope but its marginal fantasy segments and flashbacks are splashed with warm colours and dreamy cinematography, which creates an attention-grabbing juxtaposition. Yet it needs to be said that these segments, clearly aimed to offer insight into the clouded past of our protagonist, are counterproductive. In fact they shed little light and instead befuddle you further by branching out into new story lines, raising new questionsLost style. When they final pay-off is revealed, having sewn the segments together, you just want to stop the film and rewind it, hoping to catch some of the promising mystery it built up only to puncture by an absurd story in the end. It's 'The Village' of Asian cinema but luckily some detours, diversions, twists and turns prove interesting as it progresses.

An interesting and absorbing film it is, but a #122 position in the IMDb top 250 it does not deserve. Violence-buffs will find great stimuli in the gruesome torture scenes and overall Oldboy is bathed in a gritty atmosphere, laden with unflinching violence and stylized martial arts showdowns. Couple this with the patience with which it crafts its story up until the culmination and you have a revenge-film that is not only watchable, but genuinely entertaining.

Highly recommended,"Don't let that title fool you (or the reviews from people that don't understand genre)this horrifying revenge thriller from Korea's dark maestro Park Chan-wook, who gave us the wonderful Sympathy for Mr Vengeance is making the British and American offerings in this genre look pretty quaint. Oldboy has touches of Kafka, and echoes of British paranoia thrillers like The Ipcress File and The Prisoner. But it opens up a whole new sicko frontier of exotic horror, and more or less reduced my intestines to guacamole both times I watched it, not so much with its violence - although heaven knows there's a super-sized helping of that - but with a queasily ingenious imprisonment-torture impossible to contemplate without a prickling of cold sweat.

Oldboy certainly shows that it's Asia where the farthest reaches of extreme cinema are to be found, and the worst nightmare is that 15 years in prison, which leaves the numbed viewer wondering if that is an unspeakably long time - or perhaps an unspeakably short time in the nihilist wasteland Park conjures up. ""What happens after you've revenged yourself?"" wonders Dae-su. ""I bet the hidden pain will come back."" This is cinema that holds an edge of cold steel against your throat.",8.0,13 August 2007
"A Brilliant, Disturbing Thriller","I have to admit, in the first hour I was worried that this film would be another ""Kill Bill"" in that it would be a shallow, formulaic revenge flick made in a highly stylized manner. I could not have been more wrong.

""Oldboy"" starts out in predictable fashion, as we see the film's protagonist Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-Sik) captured, put through 15 years of imprisonment, and then released with a burning desire to hunt down and inflict revenge on his captors. However, as I would discover, there is more to the situation than meets the eye, and Oh Dae-Su is in for a shocking discovery.

As brutal as the film is, and believe me it is brutal, the film in directed and shot quite beautifully. Park Chan-Wook crafts an almost surreal atmosphere at times, which when coupled with the film's rough, violent tone draws comparisons to both Miike Takashi's ""Audition"" and Nicolas Winding Refn's ""Pusher."" Park's use of classical music makes the film operatic in its brutality. It's clear to see why Quentin Tarantino is a fan of the film.

Also worth mentioning are the performances by Choi Min-Sik, who fully embodies the character of desperate, tortured, ""monster"" of a man, and Yu Ji-Tae, whose portrayal as the film's villain is truly chilling.

""Oldboy"" is an incredibly cruel, and violent film. However, if one can stomach the images that Park Chan-Wook brings to the screen, the pay-off is a brilliant, disturbing thriller.",9.0,19 May 2014
Best revenge film I've seen,"This is without doubt my favourite foreign film, and is also my favourite revenge film. It's intricate yet easy to follow, very well paced and dark and brooding enough to make you identify well with the lead characters hell.

An absolute must for all enthusiasts of this type of movie. It will keep you gripped from the moment go as you try and make sense of the situation at hand, and it doesn't stop there as you try and connect the characters and their sub plots throughout the film.

As is typical in this type of movie, this all culminates in an enthralling finale as the full story unfolds and the deep dark twists reveal themselves which will leave you gawping at the screen as the credits roll.

A masterpiece in every sense of the word,"I'm rather surprised at the volume of negative comments that fill the most recent few pages...

I thought this was one of the best films I have ever seen, a remarkably-imagined and executed tour-de-force where every scene is a masterpiece. Acting from all three leads was not just good, but tremendous...and the direction is unbelievable - visceral, imaginative, original, energetic, and yet sensitive and touching. Special mention has to go to the score - which is one of the best I have ever heard.

This was a movie that was very, very exciting, but even more so, very, very moving. I have yet to see a movie that explores the pointlessness of revenge and the burden of memories and the past so thoughtfully...personally I enjoyed Kill Bill but whereas that was great, if shallow, fun, this is something else entirely. It is a stunning movie that succeeds both as an action thriller and as a powerful, affecting tragedy.

It is not an easy film to watch...besides the frequently brutal violence, it reaches climaxes of extreme emotional intensity. However it established Chanwook Park as a major talent in world cinema...personally I can't wait for Sympathy for Lady Vengeance...",10.0,20 June 2005
It hit me like a train wreck,"I like it. I've been scrolling down the mostly negative recent reviews and I was trying to find a common thread among them but nope, they come from all walks of life. Well, they're Caucasian, with maybe one Asian name who lives in the US. I'm Filipino.

I doubt they'll bother show this movie here commercially. I viewed it through an original DVD I had to order abroad. I'm only too happy to give Park Chan Wook my money as a sign he's doing well. Only too glad I've added to the growing reputation Oldboy has gathered. And happy to see many hating the film too.

I can't defend Oldboy. It's repulsive, the plot seems convoluted, there are times when the director,well, one might say, he seems to go too far... I'm just not surprised by the polar opinions about it. There are ten star ratings, there are one star ratings. I'm definitely in the ten-star side. It's epic, it's ambitious, and I bought all of it. WHY? Uh. It's not like me. I'm meek. I wear glasses. I don't know how to fight. I don't like Dae-su and I don't idolize him. I guess that's why Oldboy is entertaining for me. It's someone else's life, in relentless detail. It doesn't bother me if it's inaccurate, unrealistic, over-the-top.

It took me for a ride and in the end, I come out and go back to my life, glad that all THAT didn't happen to me. Oh, yeah, it shook me to the core, definitely. Some scenes and ideas will haunt me for a long time. I guess I just take it all as reaffirmation I'm happy as I am.",10.0,25 March 2005
Impressive and Violent Kafkanian Tale of Revenge,"On the day of his daughter's birthday, Ho Dae-su (Min-sik Choi) gets completely drunk and is arrested. His best friend No Joo-hwan (Dae-han Ji) releases him from the police station, and while calling home from a phone booth, Dae-su vanishes. Indeed he has been abducted and imprisoned in a room for fifteen years. One day, he is suddenly released, receives clothes, money and a cellular and meets the Japanese chef Mido (Hye-jeong Kang), and they feel a great attraction for each other. However, Dae-su seeks for his captor and the reason of his long imprisonment. While looking for revenge and explanation, Dae-su discloses deep secrets from the past.

""Oldboy"" is really a very impressive and violent Kafkanian tale of revenge. With a stunning direction and supported by an excellent screenplay, where there is explanation for every apparently weird situation, ""Oldboy"" is also very unpleasant, with the hero being indeed an anti-hero. The theme incest is very strong and almost forbidden for us, westerns, but when I worked in South Korea, I learned that this theme is simply unconceivable for Korean people. Further, a man be called a ""dog"" is very offensive and a great humiliation. Therefore, I believe that this movie is tougher and more offensive for Korean people, and explains the reaction of Dae-Su when the final secret is disclosed. Based on some unfair bad reviews, I believe this movie is not recommended for certain audiences that need (and has problem) to read subtitles and has difficulties to understand other cultures. My vote is nine.

"fun, stylish action film","""Oldboy"" plays like a martial arts version of a Franz Kafka novel. Dae-su Oh is a businessman in Korea who wakes up one day to find himself imprisoned in what appears to be a cheap hotel room from which he cannot escape (any time spent in a Motel 6 can elicit the same impression). He doesn't know why he's there or who put him there, but he spends his fifteen-year-long ""sentence"" watching TV and perfecting his fighting skills, the better to exact revenge on those responsible when he finally gets out. When that day comes, he sets out to unravel the mystery of his captivity, seeking out clues with the help of a sweet, sad young waitress he meets on his first day of freedom.

""Oldboy"" is an imaginative, high-energy film that keeps the viewer guessing right up to its final moments. Shot through with dark humor, stylish directorial touches, and cartoon-style (albeit fairly graphic) violence, the film is deliberately disorienting in the beginning, the better to approximate the confused psychological state of its protagonist. But eventually the plot points come fully into focus, and the film doesn't fall victim to that dreaded Third Act curse which has been the undoing of so many other mystery films of recent years.

Fun stuff.",8.0,23 July 2006
sublime,"Sublime! Revenge, desperation and deadly sins. These would be the words that describe this film in my opinion. A man seeks revenge after is confined in a room for 15 years without knowing why was he put there. He must find out in just 5 days who imprisoned him. In his quest he meets Mido a young woman who is more than she appears to be. Hmmm It looks like the genuine action movie, but it's much more then that. If you are looking for big fighting scenes you will be a little disappointed (although the corridor scene is famous), but if you are looking for raw emotion and gripping story then you must watch it.

A few words can hardly describe what i have felt during this movie(A similar atmosphere i found in ''Last tango in Paris''). The image is perfect, the music sublime(a word that perfectly describes the film)(if you like Vivaldi you'll be surprised), the characters are believable, a must see film 10/10",10.0,18 February 2007
A Masterpiece of Korean Cinema.,"What is there to say about Oldboy that hasn't already been said? This is a masterwork from iconic South Korean director Park Chan-Wook, a seminal film that came to define and ultimately, predict the Korean Wave we're still living through, 20 years later.

Oldboy is a tale about to what lengths we will go to protect - and avenge - the ones we loved. A subversive, shocking film that is as memorable as it is weird. Park isn't afraid to disturb us, to shock us, to make us question why we're watching this film; it goes to some extremely uncomfortable places, but never feels exploitative or simply going for shock value.

Choi Min Sik's performance is unbelievable in this movie. He plays it every way: a tortured soul in pain, a person in anguish, as a charming leading man, as a deranged psychopath. I don't need to tell you how good he is, this movie is 20 years old. Watch it and see for yourself.

Matter of fact, don't waste your time reading reviews. Watch Oldboy if you're into Korean/Asian cinema, if you're willing to be shocked and offended, if you're in for a good and extremely memorable time. This is a masterpiece.",9.0,17 August 2023

"Daring, hard-to-digest... but will no doubt gain from multiple viewings.","Daring, hard-to-digest urban revenge story that keeps one guessing right to the end. Loaded with obvious gangster theme touches, lots of impressive visuals, a roller-coaster pace and many characters to keep track of. Indeed, this saga will leave no audience untouched, as the off-turning scenes add up.

It does carry questionable credibility, but unfamiliar with Korean cinema in general as I am, it could just be common practice of style? I found it at its strongest in the tragic story twisting and multi-layered characters. Will no doubt gain from multiple viewings...

The film follows Dae-su (Min-sik Choi) as he gets abducted and trapped inside a hotel/jail for 15 years without an explanation and while he is in there he learns that he is framed for his wife's murder. One day he is released with no explanation and then is left to put the pieces together. He befriends a young woman name Mi-do and she helps him through thick and thin to find the answers. Do yourself a favor and watch this NOW! This film has one of the best twists I've ever seen, and it had me yelling at the end.

Not worth all the hype,"I am incredibly confused about how Oldboy managed to make IMDb's top 250. While the basic premise is promising, the plot is contrived and really doesn't make a lot of sense to me. The violence is grotesque, the cinematography is amateur and the choreography of action sequences reminds me of a Weird Al Yankovic video. Furthermore the ""values"" expressed in this film just don't seem to transfer to Western culture at all

On the positive side other than the action scenes, Min-sik Choi does a good job with what he has to work with. He makes Oh Dae-Su's transformation from a mild-mannered businessman into a vengeful thug as believable as possible.",4.0,31 December 2006
"8.6/10 - John Wick, But Way Better","John Wick, but so much better (sorry, had to say it XD).

Oldboy is a manga-based South Korean thriller, that tells the story of Oh-Dae-Su (meaning ""just trying to get through the day""), a pretty normal buisness day who gets kidnapped one rainy day without any context. Not knowing who or why, he spends 15 harsh years imprisoned, until one day he's set free - again, not knowing anything. He tries to find out the who and why, and that's all I can say without spoiling it.

I've watched this film twice this week, the first time was my first time watching it, and holy F. This film had me shocked so many times that it's actually impressive.

The plot is very interesting and captivating - the viewer, just like Oh Dae Su, is kept in the shadows, and the amount of curiousity this film is able to induce is quite big. Especially the final act - it's phenomenal imo, and it concludes the film in the best way possible.

The score is a little weird at times, but most of the time it's cool and fitting, and very well-made.

Talking about well-made, this film is, too, really well made. The cinematography is pretty good (and unique) and quite trippy from time to time, the acting is on point with almost every character.

I like this film's take on vengeance (Oldboy is one of a trilogy of vengeance themes films), how it affects one's life and psyche.

I think that the tone of Oldboy is cool, too, and I like how this kind of movie still has a lot of genuinely funny moments.

I don't think that I have any significant negative opinion about Oldboy. If I had to find at least one thing, I'd say that right now it seems to me like this film doesn't have much of rewatch value. The thrill isn't as present on a rewatch, and this film isn't extremely complicated, in my eyes at least, so a rewatch won't be as fun is it is with some other films. Though, maybe I'll think otherwise in some time, after I let the film sink in.

Overall, I really liked Oldboy. Interesting concept, extremely captivating story, phenomenal final act. Make sure your first time watching it is without interference, and in the best conditions you can. I'm feeling an 8.6/10 here.",8.0,20 October 2021

One of the greatest films ever made.,"Oldboy is my favorite film of all time and one of the greatest films ever made. In my opinion it is a pristine example of cinematic perfection. There isn't a single aspect of this film that has a flaw. The score, script, and performances (Min-sik Choi's in particular) are all breathtaking. Oldboy is an emotional roller-coaster ride that takes you through your every emotion and most of the time when you least expect it. I would recommend this film to anyone. Friends, family, or just someone off of the street and I wouldn't feel ashamed if they didn't like it. I do have to say though it is a little on the extreme side and not for the squeamish.

I urge everyone to see this film, its a beast!",10.0,10 October 2005
effective and brilliant,"This was one of my favourite films- I quite like films which are ""brutally honest"", and this film was just that. The directing was superb- I loved how the camera shots were less obvious than in a lot of films, to give it a more interesting feel, and it helped the film become, to me, a piece of art. I think if I were Korean i may find this less of a masterpiece, as to me this film was new and different, and reading the subtitles meant i didn't get bored easily, and if I missed a few of the words out it left more guess work which i like in a film. I hate it when films show and explain every detail of everything, and show every image possible, leaving nothing to the imagination, and to me, Oldboy didn't do this. The images that were shown were very dramatic and sometimes horrific, which i liked because i like experiencing shock and even disgust, and i have great respect for films such as this one which can bring out such emotions in me.

This is why Oldboy is one of my favourite, if not my favourite film.",10.0,18 April 2006

Old Boy - a modern classic,"Old boy is an extraordinary movie and has richly deserved cult following. A pity a small number of idiots don't have the intelligence or sensibility to enjoy such an extraordinary film. People always tend to rubbish what they cannot understand. Better they stick to simpler fare and leave the more demanding movies to those who appreciate them. The visual flair of this Director shows up many contemporary Hollywood film makers for the talentless hacks they are. No wonder every half decent movie from the far east gets instantly ripped-off or remade by the Hollywood money machine. It seems in the US only profit matters and originality, style or imagination is of no consequence. There are notable exceptions we all know and love but generally the Hollywood machine is as bloated and redundant as many of the dolts who queue up to watch the dross it churns out.

"a revenge picture that isn't very pretty, and loves it that way","Oldboy was a film I've been lucky to see twice in the theater (the second time not totally intentional, just the only thing playing worth seeing), and saw again recently. I'm still struck on how balls-to-the-wall director Chanwook Park goes with his story. It's an original, really bonkers and brazen kind of concept, but it needs a certain push and originality in drive to make it work.

For some this will be overkill, and it's not without an argument. The film is hyper, self-consciously violent, though perhaps not on the level of Fukasaku or Miike's films - Park's intention, I think, is to work the violent set pieces and bursts like a release valve from the melodrama. It's disturbing, but in a way that hits deep by way of raw emotions that can only come out of East Asian cinema. And it has a level of drama that's staggering, maybe for some a little far-fetched. But it's also a good lot of the time a bitingly funny film, loaded with attitude to match its style, but with a heart as well.

The small low-down on the story: Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-Sik in a towering performance worthy of Charles Bronson or Harvey Keitel or both) is nabbed un-wittingly and thrown into a prison. We follow him along in his long stint, seeming forever, until he suddenly gets 'released' into the open. Now it's time for revenge, but is the question of the truth, of the why, even more crucial than actually getting payback? This becomes the main dramatic pull of Oldboy, but it's not just a kind of ultra-violent fight and action filled epic saga.

It's also a love story, so to speak, and a film about the mistakes of youth. The antagonist of the story, Lee Woo-Jin (Yu Ji-Tae in what is one of the most absorbing and calmly demented performances in recent memory), becomes a very threatening, dark presence in the film, omnipresent a lot of the time, like a devil watching over it's subject. And when it comes to the climax, there is a level of Greek tragedy that's so strong, it had a good few in the theater I saw the film clinging tenaciously to their seats.

The story, admittedly, is very straightforward when you lay it all out (album like, ho ho), and if a director wanted to pull a Howard Hawks and cut past all of the modern aesthetic the film would be a third less in length, but on the other hand if we follow the axiom of three ""good"" scenes (Oh Dae Su and the man on the roof, Oh with the hammer in the hallway, and the ending) and no bad ones, this is a masterpiece.

But the twisted pleasure of watching a film like Oldboy unfold is in the manipulation of the style, how Park and his director of photography Jeong Jeong-hung give the film an indie wham-bang zeal while at the same time following no rules. This is demonstrated in many tense scenes, but the memorable ones include at least a few key moments in Oh Dae-Su's prison cell, and particularly the infamous long-shot as the fight breaks out in the prison hallway.

Seeing a scene like this may or may not draw some viewers down the line right away; how much can you take seeing a scene lasting 3 or 4 or more minutes of just brutal beating, choreographed to a full intensity? As with the film in general, it's a not-too guilty pleasure for genre fans, and for others they might watch it and think 'eh'.

But it is also in the people, in the characters that creates a heightened pitch in Oldboy. It's like a filmed graphic novel in some ways, but dealing with characters who (possible exceptions being Lee Woo Jin and some of his 'posse') are not part of a criminal underworld, and our main hero is turned inside out, into what he calls as himself a 'monster' (watch for the reference to Frankenstein on TV, by the way). So, when it comes time for this harsh, piercing revelation scene in the high tower Lee occupies, it leads to some devastating stuff.

Like the darkest bits out of Sophocles, Park's characters are practically doomed by fate, and it's not much of a picnic for them getting there. But for the audience, it's created as a post-modern stew. Oldboy is rough, taut, heartbreaking, disturbing and overall quite visionary - a true director's movie.",10.0,2 February 2006
different and refreshing,"wow i sure was surprised to look at all the negative reviews building up on this site, there is nothing wrong with this movie it is great, it is totally different and original. Asian people have such a different way of life then us and it really shows in their movies. watching foreign films is such a nice break from the usually westernized films we see all the time.

there is quite a complicated story here, but not only is it complicated it is very strange, very unpredictable and just weird. i love it. Oh Dae-Su is mysteriously and suddenly imprisoned for 15 years without an explanation. he is then released. throughout the entire film he is just a play toy of some deranged man who gets pleasure from watching Oh Dae-Su do ridiculous horrible things, things Oh Dae-Su himself does not realize he is doing.

stories don't get much more bizarre then this one but it is a very entertaining movie and i totally enjoyed every second of it. this movie stepped outside the boundaries and that is why it has become so popular, this movie is not afraid to include pedophiles, and men who commit incest. and because of that it makes for a much more interesting story.

the camera work and scenery is very masterful and beautiful, it is a very visually pleasing movie, and it leaves you feeling good, or me anyways, i mean sure some people may be offended by this film, but perhaps that's just because they are too stuck and have stopped mentally growing,they cannot handle films that are outside their bubbles of reality or they it is just not up their alley.

either way i highly recommend watching this film, if you don't like then its just not for you, i would say if you like stories like kill bill etc then you should defiantly check this one out.",8.0,7 December 2006
Simultaneously captivating and painful,I don't want to spoil it for anyone so I won't go into detail but this movie is great. It's as hard to watch as it is hard to stop watching. So many messed up things happening to so many people always wondering how it could possibly get any worse. I found myself rooting for the main character but also disgusted by him in some ways. This is my first movie review and I don't really know how to put into words what I loved about this film but rest assured it's a good one. The negative comments I've seen in some other reviews seem ridiculous to me. It seems like some people just don't want to like it no matter what. My guess is that they must have watched it in English instead of the native language with subtitles. I hit the subtitle button on accident and heard a completely different movie in the English version. It was terrible. Just use Korean audio with subtitles no matter what and I'm confident you'll love this movie unless you're squeamish or a complete film snob(no offense). Adios.,10.0,8 June 2006
A great exploration of the nature of vengeance,"Make no mistake; this isn't just a simple cheap revenge thriller. This is one of those movies where if you don't pay attention and focus, you'll think the movie is pointless and weak. In fact, in one of the interviews, the director makes it clear that he was not making this movie to have the audience relax; he suggests a day at a spa for such purposes.

This movie asks many important and intriguing questions: ""What is the nature of vengeance?"" ""Can our sorrows be erased through revenge?"" and ""Does revenge help us against our enemies, or does it lead us to our destruction?"". Using many unusual plot twists (including some taboo subjects) and visually unique style, the director ends up making a movie that is both peculiar and significant.

This is, once again, not a very common movie. Script is very well written with many black comedies and well-coordinated fight scenes. In addition, the classy but somewhat melancholy soundtrack (mostly orchestral music) is placed and performed perfectly. I would compare it to David Fincher's Fight Club, although Oldboy is much darker in plot,theme, and mood.",10.0,9 June 2006
Just fantastic,"This has got to be one of the strongest, most appealing movies I have seen of late. Top-notch performance and a diabolically cunning script make it a wonderful -though harsh - experience to sit through. The story is incredibly compelling and, while not 100% believable, results in one of the most suspenseful revenge thrillers ever. The ending is one of the most violent ever. This definitely made me want to read the comic-book it is based upon, though the adaptation is most likely a loose one.

I strongly recommend this film to all lovers of Asian cinema, or film in general, while stressing that faint-hearted viewers should avoid it.",10.0,15 May 2006

"After 15 years of imprisonment, a man seeks his revenge","Based on the acclaimed Manga comic book, Oldboy is a sharply made, slickly edited revenge thriller which sees Choi Min-sik playing Dae-su Oh, a man who has been locked up for the past 15 years. Understandably aggrieved at losing a decade and a half of his life, Dae-su Oh escapes his hellish confines and decides that a spot of revenge wouldn't go amiss. Cue quite a bit of bloodshed as he begins to retrace the steps that led to his mysterious capture and confinement all those years ago.

Unlike other revenge thrillers doing the rounds, there's no pithy sense of higher justification invoked in Oldboy. Rather this is a cinematic jolt of adrenaline, a crushingly violent and unflinching look at pure and simple vengeance, recounted with a breathless skill and dexterity by a confident director.

Quentin Tarantino apparently fell in love with the film while presiding in Cannes this year(2004) and awarded it the Grand Jury prize, and an American remake is already on the cards. A final word of warning: since Oldboy contains some of the most fiendishly inventive scenes of violence this one was probably not designed with your granny in mind.

It has lot of twists that are not easily foreseeable and the powerful emotional acting of the main characters is just astounding. Style and artistic tricks and effects are of great variety and amazement. Editing starts like a badly done home made film but gradually gets more refine and delivers the end as a masterpiece.

"""School is finished, now it's time for your homework, isn't it?""",,8.0,21 September 2014
"brilliant, imaginative tragedy","""Oldboy"" is the type of movie that defies expectations. It manages to stay surprising, wildly imaginative, original, thought-provoking and terrifying throughout its entire runtime. It's told in a style so weird, yet fluid (almost dreamlike, or nightmare-like) that you can neither tear your eyes away from the screen nor summarize the movie by listing the plot points. It's horrifying, brutal and cruel, but it has a very sure sense of where it wants to go and what it wants to be. It isn't arbitrary.

""Oldboy"" begins like an extreme-cinema torture film and blooms into full Shakespearean tragedy. Chan-wook Park takes age-old themes of revenge, fate and individual suffering (sometimes digging past Shakespeare, all the way to the Greeks) and resurrects them with such an assured visual and story-telling style that ""Oldboy"" becomes a one-of-a-kind type of film. The colors, the transitions, the pacing, the visual tricks and conceits are so rich, that once I started watching the film I found it hard to pause or stop.

And, while the film is primarily about vengeance, it's hardly about it they way we are generally used to films being about vengeance. It's not ""Kill Bill."" The violence in it is not cartoonish, nor playful. The style I'd almost call experimental, rather than playful even though Park utilizes everything from CGI to split-screen to different film speeds, color saturations, etc.

The film also has a twist ending which I will not reveal. I will, however, say that I think it works incredibly well. Like the best of end twists, it doesn't seek to simply shock or surprise, but layer the already-told story with strata of meanings, shed new light upon it. Thus, even if you see it coming, it shouldn't prevent you from enjoying the film.

What is the film about? Essentially it's a story of a man who, for an undisclosed reason, winds up a prisoner in an apartment for 15 years, occasionally gassed, hypnotized, drawing his knowledge about the world from a TV. He studies martial arts, attempts suicide several times, writes journals, contemplates, tries to escape.

When he is released (a little less than halfway through the movie I'd say) is when the real hell begins. And the drama on which the film so deeply focuses, the drama between him, his re-discovered world and his mysterious captor. It's at this point that ""Oldboy"" explicitly opens up to an exploration of its main theme, namely vengeance.

""Oldboy"" confronts us with very brutally frank questions about the nature of revenge and, concurrently, forgiveness. It wanders outside the Christian precepts of ""Love thy neighbor"" and ""turn the other cheek"" and digs deep into the consequences of vengeance and the changes it brings about in the individuals who conduct it as well as those who fall victim to it. What does the choice between eye for an eye and turning the other cheek reveal about us as human beings? What are the consequences of each choice? Do they alleviate the pain of the original wrongdoing?

At first sight, ""Oldboy"" might seem dead-set against revenge as an option, portraying it as mutually destructive for the victim and the culprit. But, like ""Dead Man Walking"" and its questions about the death penalty, ""Oldboy"" is much more complex. I wouldn't say that swings in one direction more than the other. I don't think that that is its goal. I think it's goal is to ask, and it does so horrifyingly well.",10.0,6 February 2005
very well done!,"As a young film student and woman of South Korean ethnicity, I was intrigued and highly entertained by this movie.

The acting by Choi Min Sik was very well done as well as the rest of the casting. I think its great that South Korean films are finally getting some light shed on them but I am kind of angry that they are going to do an American remake of this awesome film. Because then it's going to be all overly done in typical Hollywood style. Anyways I highly recommend this film.",8.0,27 April 2006
A complex film about love and the price we must pay to save it.,"Chan-wook Park's Oldboy is a grisly, ultra-violent, but wildly exhilarating experience, unlike any I have encountered at the movies this year. A grand prizewinner at last year's Cannes Film Festival, Oldboy has plenty of action, startling visual effects, dark humor, and an existential mystery that will linger in your mind long after the final credits have rolled. Based on a manga by Tsuchiya Garon, Oldboy has elements of revenge but to describe it as a ""revenge saga"" is perhaps to oversimplify things. It is a complex film about love and the price we must pay to save it.

The opening scenes offer a bit of slapstick as young Oh Daesu (Choi Min-sik) is hauled into the police station for public drunkenness on his daughter's birthday. After being bailed out by a friend, he is kidnapped and wakes up in a bleak room designed to look like a hotel but with a false view window and a locked steel door. He is being held captive but where, why, by whom, and for how long? He receives no answers, only food fed through an opening at the bottom of the door. Drugged to sleep by Valium gas, his captors come during the night to clean his room and cut his hair. When he finds out that he must remain imprisoned, his mind begins to unravel and he goes through several breakdowns.

He is hypnotized but never meets his captors. The only human faces he sees are those on the television screen where he learns one day that he is a suspect in his wife's murder. Driven only by an insane desire to get out and enact revenge on his jailer, he trains himself daily to stay in shape by punching the wall. After fifteen years, he is released but soon finds out that the world outside is as much of a prison as his room. He is deposited on a roof and finds a man ready to kill himself; yet he has no compassion, only the single-minded drive to find and kill those who imprisoned him. Without money or friends he does not ask questions when a stranger provides him with a cell phone and a wallet.

Obsessed with finding the truth for himself, Daesu begins his investigation by sampling food from the Chinese restaurants in the area to find the one that provided the food during his captivity. At one of the restaurants he meets and is nurtured by a chef named Mido (Kang Hye-jeong), but he is afraid of trusting anyone. Daesu is too bent on revenge to care much for human relationships, but little by little his attachment to Mido grows. There is a sequence where Daesu has to fight his way past a gang of thugs in a narrow hotel corridor that stands out for its naturalism. Shot in a continuous tracking shot, the scene allows its audience neither the comfort of glamorization or even much in the way of style, but simply shares the drama of a terrible struggle for survival. Like much of the movie, the scene is arresting.

Daesu's captor tracks his every move and we learn that his tormentor is a former schoolmate who blames him for a terrible event in the past. A strange blend of horror and beauty, Oldboy is not for the squeamish, but if you can stand the grimmer moments you will enjoy one of the most memorable films of the year. Park does not condemn or stand in judgment of his characters but allows us to see them as flawed human beings who have been pushed into taking extreme measures to salvage what remains of their dignity. If the ending is a bit harsh, it also has moments that are tender. Oldboy can be repulsive but it has a great deal of humanity and Daesu's pitiful sadness and longing for redemption reminds us of our own vulnerability.",9.0,13 December 2004

"Oldboy get's never old, it's getting better!","Oldboy is one hell of a movie. Great story, superb cinematography, recognizable soundtrack, strong actors and realistic action sequenzes. This asiatic movie is better than most of Hollywoods recent garbage and can easily compete with grands of their studios.

This movie achieves that you will go on thinking about it's plot for days after watching the it. The story's major plot twists are perfectly installed and every sequence of the film differs and therefore keeps the tension high till the end. The action sequences are hard and brutal and the film does not frighten to use nudity and violence to create more of it's dark atmosphere.

This piece of art should be watched by you, dear reader, because it's one of the finest movies the century has seen until today.",7.0,29 January 2023
The people that nominated this for awards are twisted scum...,"I waited many years to watch Old BoyCall it delayed gratification if you will. I found its darkness and grittiness to be attractive. The hallway scene and fight scenes were mostly satisfying. Oh Dae-Su's toughness was inspirational. It was shot well, the sound was good and the acting was great, especially Min-Sik Choi. AndThis is the most disappointing, frustrating and dissatisfying film I've ever seen.

The revelation as to why Oh Dae-Su was imprisoned and his subsequent actions were so illogical that I was enraged.

I am convinced that the filmmaker was playing a joke on the viewing publicHa, ha, very funny Mr. Park...Now, I want my money back.",1.0,3 May 2011

See This Movie,"This is one of those rare movies that completely drew me in, implicitly forcing me to accept all the ground rules it laid out. It was such an EXPERIENCE that to break it down into separate categories (plot, characterization, cinematography) would be a travesty.

However! As this is a review and not, in principle, a mere recommendation, I'll make some effort to explain about the movie. As this is a movie from Asia--and thereby subject to all sorts of conventions you wouldn't find in a Spielberg films--there are some elements that may be a bit shocking. For one thing, there's the mature content: primarily, the shocker here is in exploring issues that would likely be taboo for any American filmmaker, and an absolute death sentence in terms of finding studio funding.

Perhaps more importantly, this is a movie that encourages--if not REQUIRES--an active viewer. High-budget American films, riding on the wings of Spielberg, tend to provide rather explicit narratives--that is, they fill in any potential gaps with some type of explanation. It may simply be a differing viewpoint on how a ""good film"" is narrated, but this trend is not present in Oldboy: logical leaps are made, and it's your job to keep up with them. I personally liked the change a lot: it's refreshing for a film to require something from its viewers once in a while.

Again, as with many movies, this should be judged as a cohesive whole, and from that standpoint, I can say that it's an absolutely essential choice for any strong-stomached people considering it.",10.0,4 August 2005
A raw and visceral movie,"OK actually it is 9/10 but I'm doing my bit to counter some fools who, i think, monitor the IMDb top 100 (in order to acquire a taste they don't have for themselves) then go to each one and get mad if it isn't their type of movie, returning to do a drive-by low vote on it.

The movie is great. The soundtrack is wonderful, the camera-work, the acting, the story. It reminded me of Sin City at the time and I was surprised and pleased to read in another comment that it WAS based on some Japanese anime - I think it showed. That also explains why a few of the scenes are so OTT. But they work anyway. It all just .. all .. fits ..

Go see this movie if you like foreign films, Asian films, if you like black humor, if you like revenge, if you like seeing a new face and find he acts amazingly from the very first second you lay eyes on him. The opening minutes are mesmerizing, and the movie hardly lets up from there on.

As for the ""eating"" scene? so what? you've never eaten live lobster sushi before? if you're so easily shocked - by strong tastes, strong visuals - then find another movie to see! Old Boy is one of the years best for me.. definitely. I can shut my eyes and many many scenes replay vividly for me. Someone else mentioned that the film made them wonder if they were drunk, it had the same effect on me, in a good way.",10.0,26 May 2005
First rate suspense; Extremely disturbing tale,"Oldboy is not a masterpiece, but it is an excellent suspense/action film. To defend it from it's detractors:

1)The plot is far-fetched but no more far-fetched than any other film of this genre. The motivation of the Dae-su's tormentor is not a let down, and the twist at the end is devastating and effective.

2)I agree that some of the histrionics toward the end could have been toned down, but otherwise the performances, especially by the leads, are excellent.

3)The directors visual style and story telling are worth the hype.

This movie is not for the squeamish or those looking for a happy ending. Or for that matter, for those who look to movies to see people who react just like they would themselves.",8.0,27 January 2005
Weep and you'll find yourself alone.,"""Laugh and the whole world will laugh with you, weep and you'll find yourself alone."" Afterall, the world accepts a man with power. Everything is of power. I'm not saying about muscle or political power. The world needs someone with soundness. They praise someone who succeeded through their external adverse objects. But they simply ignore who is week in mind. A man with wickedness in soul cannot share love, instead he gives harm to others. They will feel uncomfortable, they would feel -'If I do with him, I may spoil myself...' Though they say differently each other, each of them are so selfish. Self-protection is first. In fact, NO ONE would come to a real weeper. Two man's weeping in 'OldBoy' were quite different each other. Woojin wanted Daesoo to know his weeping but daesoo couldn't be the same. Daesoo still could laugh with the world. ""Though I am a sinner who must die, haven't I still a chance to live?"" He was not weak. Daesoo, who seemingly completely lost, didn't lost everything. He survived. The real weeper - woojin, he is alone till his death. NO ONE tries to hull him up. The real weakness is evil. Power is goodness. The real weakness can not be saved. The real weakness has no value to live. No ONE understands the weak body. They just complains to him thoughtlessly ""Why aren't you laughing?""

An action movie with a deep plot and great photography+acting,"This film uses very well features like flashbacks, plot twists and a surprising ending. The film makes you feel that it could be ended in at least 5-6 points yet it manages to end in such a way that leaves you satisfied no mean feet by itself as many movies weak spot is a lengthier ending than necessary or the opposite, and more movies fail to do successfully a series of turnarounds of the story near the end of the film without spoiling it. Notable also is the fact that although it is a violent story it has brief battle scenes. Another fact interesting to me is that the movie highlights what can be accomplished by highly sophisticated methods of torture like the ones employed in this movie to irrevocable change the personality of the subject even subconsciously. In an era of restrictions to the freedom of expression, invasion in privacy, and prisons working in law black holes like Guadanamo we must seriously think if war on terror is on the right track. Violence in revenge of violence never brought anything but more violence and despair.",10.0,12 January 2005
A Strange Double-Revenge (Octopus Fans Please Look Away),"Oldboy is a twisty, confounding shape-shifter of a film, but it doesn't give one the impression of leaning on its own narrative conceits like a lot of movies do. There's more to Oldboy than story contrivance; there's real manic energy being expended, and there's a tonal complexity that makes it seem almost novelistic. Most movies would be content to be as dynamic as Oldboy, as syntactically accomplished, as fearless, but Oldboy is also existentialistic; it's an action movie that not only dabbles in philosophy but, in its way, puts across a picture of the universe. It seems as immersed in Zeitgiest as the German films of the twenties; it conveys a sense of a world tottering on the edge of sanity, a landscape composed of equal parts paranoia, bloodlust and desperate longing. It has urgency, but it doesn't only have urgency; it has a kind of indolence underneath this, a gravity keeping the crazy parts of the story from flying apart. The film is kinetic, but there's an undercurrent that flows a lot more sluggishly, that balances the frantic surface action. There's a strange calm at the center of Oldboy, the tranquility one might perceive while peering into a bottomless abyss.

The plot can only be described as a devious piece of manipulation, an implausible yet deeply satisfying load of malarkey. It begins in a prison cell that looks like a hotel room; Dae-Su, an average man with a few guilty secrets, awakes from a bender to find himself imprisoned here, not knowing who is responsible for his captivity, or what he did to deserve it. Being locked up, not to mention intermittently drugged and subjected to the arts of a hypnotist, is liable to put anyone in a vengeful mood, and this is just what happens to Dae-Su, who endures years of tedium relieved only by television, wall-punching and the occasional suicide attempt, only to be released suddenly into an outside world scarcely less inscrutable than that of the prison. Dae-Su, haggard and thirsty for revenge, sets out to learn the identity of the man responsible for his incarceration, and in the process becomes involved with a young chef, Mi-Do, who aids him in his endeavors. The ex-prisoner's adversary, Woo-Jin, is some kind of wealthy but depressed playboy, who seems to enjoy toying with the hapless Dae-Su, but may in fact have more perverse things on his mind than simple torture.

The unraveling of the puzzle is handled with astonishing skill by Chan-Wook Park, a director who rivals Tarantino for cinematic flair. Park's formidable sense of syntax is demonstrated in the early passages of Dae-Su's imprisonment; Park compresses time beautifully here, and conveys Dae-Su's progression from disorientation to wild anger to sharply-honed, desperate anger. Then there are moments where Park seems to merely revel in the opportunity to create strange cinematic effects. The best one happens during a fight-scene in a corridor; Park stages the scene as one unbroken shot, the camera tracking laterally down the length of the hallway where Dae-Su, proficient in fighting after years of practicing in his cell, tangles with an endless succession of martial arts baddies. The scene seems like an embodiment of everything the film is: it's both kinetic and strangely still; the cut-away quality of the shot creates the sense of staring at ants in an ant-farm, the objectivity of, if not a god, then someone capable of adopting a god-like point-of-view. Trying to make sense of his situation is, for Dae-Su, a little like trying to piece together fragments of bad dreams, hoping for some ultimate clarity; not unlike what Kafka's heroes went through in their efforts to hash out the rules of a universe where the rules were beyond comprehension, where the shape of things was always changing. Park creates a labyrinth for Dae-Su to navigate, a maze of shifting walls where the shifting is anything but random. The syntax, the beautiful fitting-together of the images, creates the sense of an elegant but violent, inclement, pressure-cooker universe.

The movie seems suffused with existential dread, the jitteriness and confusion of modern life. Dae-Su is a kind of puppet, his actions determined beforehand not by fate or god but by his mysterious antagonist, Woo-Jin, who is also ruled by things beyond his understanding, his conscious control. Neither man is ultimately the master of his fate; they circle each other like lonely worlds in orbit, spinning closer and closer, doomed to collide and destroy each other. The gravity that holds these men together is a mutual need for vengeance; the story details Dae-Su's quest for revenge, then turns itself inside-out and shows that Woo-Jin is really trying to get revenge on Dae-Su. Movies often tackle this theme of revenge-lust as a kind of trap, but in Oldboy the trap seems bigger than this. Dae-Su is a bug in a maze, but Woo-Jin is a bug in a bigger maze. The universe becomes labyrinthine, human motivation boiled down to simple, bloody imperatives. The movie is savage, sometimes absurdly so (a live octopus is consumed at one point; at another a man has his teeth yanked out with the claw-end of a hammer), but the savagery is only part of the picture. There's a sadness underneath the whole thing, conveyed most touchingly by the relationship between Dae-Su and Mi-Do, who become lovers, spirits united at least for awhile against the cruelty, the confusion of life. It's easy to see a movie like Oldboy only in terms of surface effect, of action and blood and sadism, but there are undercurrents running through everything that show how deeply-felt the film-making is despite the shock-scenes, the Asian-cinema hysteria, the reveling in violence. It's a film at once simple and intricate, elegant and brutal, violent and tender.",,28 October 2005
A movie that explores the theme of revenge in a unique and shocking way,,7.0,11 August 2023
"An amazing story, wonderfully visualised, directed and acted. A must see.","Oldboy begins with a typical Hitchcock style story. A man is imprisoned for 15 years with no understanding of why or, during his incarceration, any idea of how long. Then suddenly he is free and his journey begins.

The style in this film just pours out of the screen. Yet they don't overpower and dominate the movie as they would in Hollywood, they look as integral to the story as do the actors and the dialogue. They aren't treated as a big moment but viewed as a whole with the rest of the film. There are some really nice touches throughout the movie, in particular the movement between scenes, the corridor fight or the beautifully shot snow scene all really stand out for me.

That brings me nicely onto the action topic. Asian film, ""must be lots of martial arts"" I hear some of you non-converts shout. Not at all. The action and fighting is some of the most realistic I've seen in a movie. People go down when they are hit, and when hit hard they stay down. That is except Oldboy himself, fuelled by fifteen years of revenge and hatred, he is allowed a but more leeway. Yet that doesn't stop the action being beautifully choreographed and put together.

In particular the fight scene in the corridor shows the beauty and care placed into the fight scene. It takes place in a long corridor with the camera panning back and forth following the action as Oldboy, successfully and realistically, fights approximately fifteen men. The action frequently slows and stops, and with no real moments where you are pulled back out of the movie thinking you are watching the impossible.

Some of the scenes are tough to watch, not because they are all gruesome, but because Asian filmmakers have the balls to push the audience and make them feel something more than the average cinema experience. To feel something, much like the main character. So scenes are uncomfortable or uneasy because you're feeling the same as the characters.

The live sushi moment is stunning to watch, and conjured up some strange emotions in me, I'm still not sure how I feel about it. The torture scenes are arduous but so real and fear inducing. Perhaps the most shocking and emotionally strong moments are saved for the latter half of the film. Don't be concerned though, these aren't vile in any way, they just make you feel incredibly uncomfortable and very uneasy.

To me, that is what cinema is all about, even all art. It's about making you feel something, not sitting in a darkened room letting images and story wash over you then disappearing for your dinner and a chat about the weather. You want, and need, to be pulled into the movie, to feel and empathise with the characters, forget about the world around you and all the other people and their lives, and finally come away with the haunting of those feelings. The movie should continue on in your mind and pop up in conversations, provoking thoughts and discussion, otherwise you've wasted your time and money. Oldboy satisfies that to perfection.

Unfortunately I can't really go into the story, not that I do much in reviews anyway, but in the case of Oldboy it really does give far too much away even touching on it. Check out the IMDb listing if you really want, however just trust me, it's a superb story and you don't want to know anything more about it beforehand. For the last twenty minutes or so you will be astounded and the twists and turns keep coming right up to the very end.

It's also quite a moving story and takes on what exactly makes a person and defines who they are and the labels they carry through their lives. Most of all though it's about revenge and how unfulfilling, all consuming and empty it can make you feel.

The actors are really good across the whole movie, but it is the leads that really excel. Min-sik Choi is utterly believable and gives such a powerful performance. His acting coupled with the visual style will have you holding your breath at times. The female lead Hye-jeong Kang and the protagonist Ji-tae Yu also offer excellent performances. The range of emotion that the character Woo-jin Lee has to go through is enormous, and Yu performs them brilliantly, while Kang plays a restrained, controlled and tortured mind to perfection. There is a real depth to these characters, and they are brought to life by these three wonderful actors.

This movie is an excellent example of what cinema can be, and once again the lesson comes from outwith Hollywood, I just wish they would sit up and listen in class. The movie is not any single scene, but the sum of it's wonderful set pieces, beautiful style, imaginative camera work, truly wonderful performances from all the leads, and a stunning story. You have to see this movie.",10.0,30 August 2005

"well done, but not totally original","I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival and it was my fave of the festival and 2004. When the film ended, the entire theatre was buzzing and I knew everyone was thinking the same thing - turn down the lights and roll it again! A truly great film is one you can watch over and over again, its more than just story telling or eye candy. Its a damn shame Oldboy and the director's other films aren't more available in North America - we are missing out on great Korean cinema.

An excellent film about revenge and how it can possess people till self-destruction. But, if you're having a hard time actually seeing 'Oldboy', just find 'Angel Heart' starring Mickey Rourke and Robert De Niro (1987). I doubt the director 'stole' this idea, but the similarities in plot and characters are very close. Coincidence? Maybe not. It is also a great film, Mickey Rourke's finest role after 'Barfly'.",10.0,14 January 2005
Wow,"Well what can i say that hasn't already been said about this film? It has everything that you want from a movie, good acting, good cinematography, great directing and IMHO a twist that is up their with the likes of The Usual Suspects. i really cannot sing this film's praises enough.

I really do urge everyone to see this film, subtitles will not be a problem, after 10mins you forget you are reading them. You may need a strong stomach at some points in the film but i do not wish to give anything away.

This movie is so fantastic it really does deserve to be seen by everyone, also see this before the American re-make comes about. their is no way a remake can compare to this it is almost perfect",10.0,24 December 2005
The most chilling climax since Se7en,"I just watched this amazing movie last night. First of all, this has the most chilling ending of any movie I have seen since ""Se7en"". And I watch A LOT of movies. When a movie makes cold chills run down my spine, like ""Oldboy"" did when the twist is revealed, it's a masterpiece in film-making to me. There's nothing about the movie that I did not like, absolutely nothing. And I think it's better than ""Kill Bill"" in every respect, in fact, much better. After watching director Park's ""CUT"" from the ""Three... Extremes"" anthology and being very impressed, ""Oldboy"" seals the deal that this is the director to watch. Superbly filmed, amazing performances, a dynamite soundtrack, and a story that will linger in your thoughts long after the credits roll. I still can't get over the feeling I had when the twist is revealed. Just absolutely amazing how a movie can physically take over your body, and make you visibly shaken. I was very shaken, disturbed, and in total awe that this director was able to pull off such a phenomenal flip flop of the revenge genre. Kudos to this great film, and a must-see if there ever was one.",9.0,11 February 2005

"well, i liked it!","good Christ, there's a lot of negative reviews of this film here.

old boy may be overcomplicated and highly stylised but that doesn't change the fact that its a brilliantly made thriller with some excellent twists.

a lot of the reviews on here seem to spend too much time picking the film apart with various clever comments on the plot holes and lack of in-depth character.

well, i'll tell you this for nothing - oldboy blew me away. its one of the most entertaining mysteries i've seen for a long time. the idea of a man being locked up for 15 years without knowing why and then being released in order for him to unearth the reason behind his incarceration is a story i've never seen executed with such skill as it is here. okay, so the final scenes are full of exposition (and are perhaps gratuitously violent merely as a way of distracting us from this blatant plot unfurling) but the journey leading up to that point is intriguing, action-packed, funny and clever.

i can't believe that the lead review i read on this title's main page complained that the violence wasn't violent enough and that he thought the twist at the end was good, but he'd fallen asleep before the twist came about and so didn't get it. go and rent The Story Of Ricky, for god's sake.

its worth your time, trust me. also, check out lady vengeance (the last film in chan-wook park's revenge cycle) - its equally as mind-boggling, entertaining, enthralling and beautiful as oldboy.",8.0,19 May 2006
With hints of Hitchcock Park Chan-wook Never Lets Up,"Though it maybe too violent for some, Park tells an excellent tale of revenge that borders on the bizarre and twisted. A man, Oh Dae-Su is imprisoned briefly on the night of his young daughters birthday then released only to find himself kidnapped and imprisoned in a new type of jail cell: a hotel room. There he is locked up for 15 years were he has little contact with any humans. He obsessively watches T.V.where he learns of his wife's murder. Occasionally the room will fill with 'valium' gas and when he awakes he is clean shaved and has a new haircut. This routine continues through the 15 year period. When he is released he enters on his Odyssey of revenge to discover the identity of his captors. This is where the film really picks up, he befriends a female sushi chef named Mido, who sympathizes for Oh Dae-Su after hearing his story. She ends up joining Oh Dae-Su on his quest in discovering the motivations of his captors. On their journey Oh Dae-Su encounters many twists and turns that vary from the violently surreal to the oddly bizarre. There are some great fight sequences where his rage consumes him so fully he is able to fight off his captures with a knife sticking out of his back. This is just one of the very powerful and violent scenes in 'Oldboy'. There are also scenes of torture and gore that are particularly intense. The violence may over shadow the brilliance of this film, however the narrative asks no sympathy for Oh Dae-Su but only to study him. The man who imprisoned him states: ""I'm sort of a scholar, and what I study is you."" This is how we observe the film, as scholars of Oh Dae-Su. I do not agree with the actions he takes at the epilogue of this film, and i feel it may have gone on ten minuets too long. However, I feel this film has reached a level of suspense and terror on par with the likes of Alfred Hitchock. As Hitchcock's films pushed the limits of cinema in his era I see parallels to what Park has achieved in crafting suspense and shock. The story takes many twists and turns that never makes you feel easy, just when you feel you know where Park is taking you he adds an extra twist to the story to make it that much more satisfying. Using elements of the surreal tied with extreme violence and sexuality Chan-wook Park creates a masterful story that gives a new spin on the revenge genre that reflects that of a Greek tragedy. I give this film my highest recommendation, that is if you can get past the violence and disturbing images, however each moment is done tastefully and serves a purpose pushing the narrative forward.",9.0,20 June 2005

"Excellence, the best film of the last 4 decades","This is simply put, amazing cinema. The music that accompanies the film is as recognisable as distinguished classical music such as Beethoven and Mozart going as far as to incorporate Vivaldi's four seasons' winter movement. The music, however, is just the start of what was an unfortunately overlooked film. The acting of this film was of such calibre it didn't even bring to question ""I wonder how the actors prepared for these roles, how do they work so well together, where does this chemistry come from?!"" as they perform to such a fine extent that the viewer is immediately immersed in the film to the extent where there are no actors, there is no film, only a constant denouement which leaves a viewer at times, so immersed that we become isolated from our own world, accepting Dae-Su's viewpoint as our own. This is a critical skill that this film harnesses as the subject material is quite difficult to grasp and accept freely otherwise. It gets to a point where Dae-Su is approached and depicted as an almost Travis Bickle type character, that is to say, an anti hero. Plot holes such as the age difference between dae su and woo jin are covered effortlessly by acting, choreography and cinematography that puts films widely regarded as classics such as ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" to crippling shame. This film without a doubt is the best film i have ever seen, by a long way, there is something here, not for everyone but those who are willing to suspend the constraints of our reality in return for stepping into Oh Dae Su's.",10.0,31 May 2005
"Extraordinary, stylish, brilliant, but probably not appropriate for everybody","***Very minor spoilers***

This movie will (and it already has) split up the audience in two groups: One group, that will be totally impressed by the film, its script the exceptional editing and cinematography and another group, that will see no sense in this movie, only a succession of absurd and bizarre situations and scenes.

It may take a while to get used to the peculiar style of this movie. I think I would attribute myself to the first group, at least after I have watched ""Oldboy"" for the second time. I was even very impressed by it, but I have to admit that it was a little bit hard for me to get used to the movie's specific fashion. But I guarantee, once you've cottoned on to the style of it, you will love it!

One has to look at this movie as mixture of a piece of art and a complex thriller/drama. It is surreal at times, but not as much as David Lynch's films f.ex., because it absolutely has a continuous and coherent storyline, although several situations and the character's actions are a bit unbelievable at times, which is probably the biggest problem, that the objectors of this film have.

But the style, thus editing and cinematography are just awesome. The way, the director presents certain scenes by using stylistic features such as freeze images, special music and narrating instead of dialogues is marvelous, it breaks old customs, but it perfectly works. Especially the first half of the film is very stylish and terrificly edited, the second half of if is rather devoted to story and its twists. The sooner the ending comes the more brilliant the script and the twists are. And the denouement at the end will take your breath, but even if you watch the movie for the second or third time you will notice hints and things that you haven't noticed before, because they are not essential to understand the twist, but they show once again how great and sophisticated the script is.

So if you don't shy at peculiar and extraordinary Asian movies, go see it, you won't be disappointed.",9.0,4 June 2005
Unbelievable!! Please Hollywood Don't Ruin This!!!!,"Oldboy is one of those rare movie experiences that unfolds deliberately and note perfect. Park layers on the detail of Daeshu's journey from the opening frame yet never lets the viewer on to where the path will take and it does take some dark and unnerving twists. Still this is bold and visionary film-making at its finest with standout performances by each of the 3 leads. Mass American audiences will never find this film though as there are few distributors that have the courage to stand behind a film this risky and adventurous as far as the subject matter goes, i.e. the final reveal and the choices that it brings. The final 2 minutes alone will have most American audiences gasping in PC shock and most likely offended. This does not seem to be Park's meaning despite the challenging and uncompromising actions that Daeshu makes. Film-making this good deserves to be recognized and rewarded--thank you Cannes Grand Prix--but it is a pity that only those that seek out material this unique will find it. Thank the celluloid Gods that I did!!!!",10.0,5 February 2005
"Short, non-spoilery review of one of the greatest films I've ever seen.","Oldboy tells the story of a man who, after being imprisoned for no immediate reason, goes after his captor who framed him for the murder of his family.

A masterpiece of deception and the power of suggestion, this violent and intense little Korean film is one of the best films I've seen so far this year. I plunked my $8 down at the film festival counter and watched the movie with the older, snotty film fest crowd who didn't bother to read about the film that they were going to watch.

And, yes, I chuckled to myself as they gasped and said ,""Oh...it's subtitled..."" And I chuckled when they squirmed during the more intense scenes.

I was lucky enough that this past month's Fangoria had a nice little article about Oldboy AND the festival actually got it...or else I would have been ticked. It's the middle part of Chan-wook Park's vengeance trilogy that started with Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and will end this year when he releases Sympathy for Ms. Vengeance.

It's powerful, gritty, realistic, and fantastic and if you get to see the British release print that's circulating the country right now, do so. It seems to be uncut. The only bothersome thing is that it has white subtitles. I prefer yellow ones, myself...easier to read.",10.0,11 June 2005

When I did read the reviews I was quite surprised, but each to his own. I noted that there was an American remake that got very poor reviews. I have now seen that 'Oldboy' is #2 in a trilogy of films by Chan-wook Park and as a film buff I will watch those and re-evaluate.",6.0,9 October 2020
Not my cup of tea,"This is not a movie I would watch. I don't even know how I ended up watching it, but I did.

I was haunted for days and weeks after watching this movie. It made me question the purpose of each characters and rightness or wrongness of what propelled them forward.

Both male leads labored for revenge. It is no exaggeration to say they lived on only for the purpose of revenge and when its finally within reach, their whole turned again. Revenge: bloody, ruthless, and desperate revenge. I don't want o spoil anything so I wont continue, but for certain, the decisions of these two men made me question everything. What is right and what is wrong.",9.0,1 February 2023
Another hidden treat from the realms of Korea,"Known for the shocking violence and lengths that a stereotypical Korean film goes to, there shouldn't be too many surprises with Chan-wook Park's highly acclaimed psychological thriller...however there certainly is.

An explicit sexual scene, a number of other raunchy moments, people being battered to a pulp and the leading character yanking out the teeth of his nemesis with a hammer to name only a few. It certainly isn't for the faint hearted though you probably knew that from the outset.

'Oldboy' follows Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) - a man imprisoned for 15 years without explanation and released for five days in a bid to understand why and seek vengeance. He meets an alias in Mi-do (Hye-jeong Kang), a mysterious woman who sets out to help him.

While it isn't for the weak hearted as I stated earlier, nor is it for the thick. 'Oldboy' is a film which doesn't spoon feed you too much of what's going on so you will have to have your brain switched on and interpret some key plot scenarios from earlier clues. It has a number of twists and possibilities which make it a riveting ride from start to finish.

The acting is superb with the ""anti-hero"" performed to a tee by Min-sik Choi (he also plays an outstanding role as the sadistic murderer in 'I Saw the Devil, six years on from this production). Ji - tae Yu is also excellent as one of the villains while the remaining cast members are all fantastic.

The main plot twist is disturbing, utterly brilliant yet at the same time disappointing. It feels all a little too unrealistic; in fact while others may argue to climatic half to the film is where its genius lies, I much preferred the opening half before everything unravelled. But that's just my opinion!

'Oldboy' focuses heavily on character and its complex narrative and the end product is very good. In the same genre, 'I Saw the Devil' (also starring Min-ski Choi) is my favourite revenge movie of that nature - it took me by storm!

'Oldboy' is more complex and much beefier in terms of what makes up the running time which is its downfall as well as its merit.",7.0,7 September 2013
More fun watching sticking your head in a toilet to watch the brown submarines,"I watched this movie because I needed to get my mind off my painful hemorrhoids. Sure enough, I forgot about my roids because I was too busy trying to put my eyeballs back in their sockets after gouging them out with a Big Gulp straw. That's how bad this movie is. I am not kidding. I looked around the theater (after managing to pop my peepers back in) and saw that no less than 64 people were also struggling with their gouged eyeballs. The other 12 had hung themselves with twizzlers. One kid seemed to be enjoying the movie, but he also seemed to be enjoying his booger collection, so maybe the question you must ask yourselves before paying to see this movie is, do you enjoy booger collections? Well, do you? Oh there is another reason to like this movie. If you enjoy watching animals get killed (in real life), then this is the movie for you. But since those kinds of people also enjoy booger collections, I guess the point is redundant.",1.0,19 October 2010
Excellent,"Few years ago Korean society was shocked by a horrible serial killer mayhem. Dozen of call-girls are disappeared and never returned when they visited unknown customer. The serial killer also murdered innocent old men and women on his loose. After caught of serial killer the revealed fact was beyond one's imagination. He killed girls with hammer, chisel and amputated the victims. Some of them were cannibalized. He mashed victim's liver with food processors and drank it. Now the serial killer is sentenced to death and his existence throw serious questions about execution of death sentenced prisoner to the Korean society. For ten years Korean government never executed prisoners and now UN approved Korea as a No Execution country.

This movie is a product of these social circumstance. Of course any modernized country can have notorious serial killers. But this is most brutal and abominable criminal act as reported to the public.

Another phenomena described in this movie are the inactive police act and ugly politician. Koreans are very disappointed at this and this movie is quite accurately visualized the situation.

Whether or not crime is the best motif for movie and this movie successfully hold the breath of viewers. I am waiting another movie from this director.

Good work.",10.0,27 January 2012
My all time favorite Korean movie,"Oldboy (2003) is a Korean masterpiece in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on a random streaming service. The storyline follows a pompous businessman who is one day kidnapped and forced to live in a hotel room for 15 years. He gets food, clothes and haircuts as he's randomly drugged and wakes up with everything he needs on a daily basis. After 15 years he mysteriously wakes up in a field. He tries to form some semblance of a life while being obsessed with tracking down who kidnapped him and gain revenge.

This movie is directed by icon Park Chan-wook (Thirst) and stars Choi Min-sik (I Saw the Devil), Yoo Ji-tae (The House that Jack Built), Kim Byeong-Ok (Sympathy for Lady Vengeance), Kang Hye-jeong (Nabi) and Yoo Yeon-Seok (Mr. Sunshine).

This is my all time favorite Korean movie. The storyline, characters and circumstances are so unique and like nothing you've ever seen before. The acting by Choi Min-sik is outstanding and his mannerism, persistence and desperation is perfectly depicted. The action scenes are legendary and the hammer scene and any sequence involving teeth or a tongue is a 1000/10. The storyline is well paced and unfolds into a legendary climax. The ending is unbelievable, sad and disgusting all at the same time. The backstory on the school kids is so smart and how the pieces all fit together is perfect.

Overall, this is a unique drama with fantastic gore that is an absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,26 February 2023

8.4 ?? Really ??,"First of all, let me begin by saying that I love foreign movies. Before watching this film, I had pretty high expectations Sadly, I was disappointed. The story was decent at best, the acting was also decent, barely any action scenes, and after about half the movie I found myself bored from this movie. My only props for this movie is that the direction of the movie was good. On the other hand, it's not a bad movie. It's a nice movie for those looking fora decent foreign action movie with a few action scenes. I personally wouldn't recommend this movie, and I do agree with some people in the threads saying it's overrated. I couldn't find any reason why this movie got such a high rating.",9.0,3 October 2015
Old Boy. Why this is a very decent film.,"Old Boy. Why this is a very decent film. For those people who like films and have a sense of theatrical and cinematographic history. If you are familiar with the concept of ""tragedy"" as it has evolved from the ancient Greeks: Euripedes, Aeschylus et al, through Shakespeare and the Renaissance tragedians and, in more modern times, Beckett, Brecht etc... then you will know that as far as contemporary mainstream Western cinema in concerned, this genre is all but dead. However, this is not the case in the Far East, as Old Boy shows. This film explores the great tragic grand narratives but with the inclusion of a Kafkaesque twist. If you are not moved it is because you do not feel. This film is, by degrees: absurd, comic, tragic. Despite its eastern heritage there are touches of The Revenger's Tragedy and other plays that would be spoilers to mention. This is not a film where violence is the central tenet. Violence arises out of the circumstances in which the main character finds himself. Like the best of ancient Greek tragedy it shows us much about the human condition and how we are to live. Watch it - imagine if you had to live it.",,23 May 2006
Korean film that was good but not quite what I expected,"Oh wow what a tough time I have had trying to compose my thoughts about this, a movie by many considered a modern masterpiece but to me it was although a good movie, nowhere near perfect. So much has been said about this movie and much I expected that I felt let down and it's kind of annoying because this is actually more than OK as a film but because it is so highly regarded by some you expect this to be like some magical ride into a movie. It's basically pretty crazy and has its fair share of violence too, it never shies from trying to shock the viewer and by the end you might either feel sick or have become desensitised.

The story is all about a man by the name of Oh Dae-su who is taken out of nowhere from the street and put into a jail of sorts for 15 years, being gassed and injected with a strange substance continuously. The plot then progresses to Oh Dae-su being released and that sets into motion his quest to find out who did this to him and also any details of his daughter. The movie is really a study of the mind in a sense and tries extremely hard to make you feel grossed out but in a way where it just seems to fit in with the way the movie is going, many other movies I could feel slightly taken aback by teeth pulling, but here it feels common place.

Park Chan-wook directs and does a pretty good job really as he mixes dark style elements with humour of which I feel stands out the most. The opening is truly the great part of this and it makes you interested from the start, the middle starts to loosen its grip in my opinion though and although right at the end it starts to feel alright again, for the most part the second half it is kind of dull and meaningless things are put in. I do feel this movie has very little to it as well with it really feeling like an action movie that has a bit more dramatic effect than others maybe out there but you could also say about the strange style in which this is played out. Parts can feel a little like style over substance and sometimes the look of the movie seems to be the thing trying to move the movie when really it should be interesting plot lines.

Choi Min-sik is the man who plays Oh Dae-su and he is really good actually, mixing crazy with true emotion and really he makes the role completely his own. No other character quite gets the all round mental analysis that Dae-su gets but people like Mi-do (Kang Hye- jung) and Lee Woo-jin (Yoo Ji-tae) come pretty close to getting a full blown brain scan, the whole movie really tries to dig deep into the characters and reveals many things about them and the way they feel about things going on the story as it progresses.

So all in all Oldboy really is a movie that is memorable but for me not it's skill as a movie, but in what it contains. I wasn't actually that grossed out throughout and although some scenes look pretty bad, the film is never that squeamish you shouldn't watch this. Of course this movie will also be remembered for its crazy octopus scene, the hallway fight, the general weirdness of the prison and of course the ending which is so out of nowhere in terms of the way you think this is going that it feels like some sort of strange movie added on to this already weird film.",7.0,28 November 2015

Oldboy,"Oldboy, is a Korean film although it is dubbed into English. The film is about a man named Oh Dae-Su, who is kidnapped and locked in a private prison for fifteen years. When he is finally set free he is given five days to find out who did this to him and he plans on finding out and getting revenge for his imprisonment and death of his wife. Oldboy, has good performances from everybody in the cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing and good art direction. The film starts off with a very interesting premise and the visual look of the film is great but the story seems to go downhill as the movie moves along. One of the big problems I had with this movie is that I had a really hard time understanding it and I found it very confusing and muddled. When the movie finally got near it's ending time I found the film too long and it got boring and I felt like it could have ended a lot sooner. Also in some ways the movie was kind of pointless to me and it really left no impact. I thought I would like this film quite a bit because of very good reviews it has received and some recommendations I have gotten for the film but other than it's visual style the movie did nothing for me. An American remake is currently underway for this film and usually I'm opposed to remakes but maybe if I saw this film from a different point of view I might like it or respect it more.

the most complex take on the vengeance film.,"Park Chan-wook's masterpiece, ""Oldboy,"" has returned to theaters in 2023, two decades after its initial release, and it still delivers a visceral punch that is unmatched. In a genre filled with revenge narratives, ""Oldboy"" stands out as perhaps the most intricate and subtle take on the theme. While other contemporary revenge films like ""Unforgiven"" are undoubtedly great, ""Oldboy"" surpasses them in its ability to delve deep into the human psyche and to ""punish"" audiences.

I remember my first viewing of ""Oldboy"" near its original release, and what struck me then was its audaciousness. It embraced a nearly expressionistic approach to the vengeance narrative, pushing boundaries in ways that left a lasting impression. However, upon rewatching it, it was only about a quarter of the way through that I recalled the shocking plot twist. It was during this second viewing that I truly grasped the profound complexities of the characters' predicaments.

""Oldboy"" remains a film that is as strange and shocking as ever, but this time, I wasn't constantly taken by surprise. Instead, I was gripped by the unsettling realization of the fragility of the human condition. The film masterfully explores how our past sins can perpetually haunt us, how we often seek vengeance as a means to deflect blame onto others, and how we bury the events that have shaped us, only to be unprepared for their eventual resurfacing.

I found myself glued to the screen, unable to look away, and increasingly uncomfortable in my seat. It wasn't the grotesque scenes that made me squirm; it was the profound and uncomfortable truths about the human experience that ""Oldboy"" forced me to confront. The film is a chilling reminder of how our past choices and actions can continue to echo through our lives, and how we grapple with the consequences of our own dark history.

""Oldboy"" is, without a doubt, a cinematic masterpiece that has not lost an ounce of its power over the years. It's a film that challenges its audience to examine the depths of their own humanity and leaves a haunting impression long after the credits roll. Park Chan-wook's vision and storytelling prowess shine brightly in this re-release, reminding us why ""Oldboy"" remains a timeless and essential work of cinema.",10.0,3 September 2023
"Good storyteller, Good lighting, Good film","Very good. Park chan-took knows how to make movies, he proved it in 2003 with this film, winning mise en scène in Cannes. Today with decision to leave, so close to being in the Oscars (wrongfully not nominated). He created a new way of storytelling. We can really deeply feel his enthusiasm for editing. He plays with time and deconstructs the story but he is still staying in the most common linear storytelling timeline. I would have loved a less linear one, but it still fits the movie. Great work with camera, a DoP and a director of Lighting. Justified or not, he still places light and camera work at a high value. And I just wouldn't image this film without these principal assets.

Old Boy Wonder,"A drunken man, Daesu, disappears one night after being released from the police station. He finds himself imprisoned in what looks like a small motel room. He does not know who's imprisoned him or why. He later finds out from the television in his room that his wife was murdered, he is held responsible for her death, and his young daughter has been adopted. He remains captive in the room for fifteen years, preparing to seek revenge on the person who is behind the murder of wife and his imprisonment.

Upon his release, he meets a sushi chef, Mido, and falls in love. She helps him unravel the mystery behind the fifteen years he's lost. The ingenious setup of this film is that Daesu meets his tormentor Woojin, face to face, early on. Daesu cannot kill him because he wants answers, so he is forced to allow Woojin to observe him revelation after revelation. Woojin tells him he has five days to figure it all out or Mido dies.

Old boy is disturbing, it is twisted, and its effects linger. There are some shocking scenes of violence. There is also an amazing fight scene that takes place in a narrow hallway. The point of the film is not to feel sympathy for Daesu. He will exact his revenge. Or will he? It is the revelation of Woojin's motive we wait to see. Choi Min Shik and Yu Ji Tae give amazing performances. Old Boy is a brilliantly structured film in which revenge serves no redemptive purpose--it simply becomes the sole consuming purpose of both men, the very thing that destroys them both.",10.0,17 October 2005
remarkable film,"Very fine if gruelling speeding bullet of a film that still has time for decent characterisation and thought provoking dialogue. I went to look up my piece on the same director's earlier, Sympathy for Mr Vengeance, and see I never wrote it up. Possibly the reason is, as with this one, it is rather difficult after such an onslaught, both with violence and emotion, to gather one's thoughts in a sufficiently clear manner. The film has opened theatrically here to rave reviews, which I do not often find a good omen and several IMDb reviewers find it slow and lacking in violence and gore. Well maybe there is not as much blood as in some but it is far easier to watch an arm issue forth a fountain of blood than to watch just a second of Mr Park's gastronomic or dentistry scenes. Well worth watching though and I feel that after a second viewing when I will not be quite so confused with the 'imprisonment' at the start and a little more able to 'enjoy' the more vigorous sequences, I shall be in position to give a better account of this remarkable film.",9.0,12 January 2007
Oh-Dae-Su = Oh My God,"This is a masterpiece. No doubt about it. The movie from beginning to end has a pace and electricity to it you can't ignore. This film will grab you by the short and curlies and command you to take notice. You can't describe the way this movie delivers. It will make you laugh, cry, wretch and flinch. In parts it's beautiful, tender, loving and moving and in parts it can be monstrous and ugly, and sometimes all at once. The acting, the scenes, the music and direction are all tremendous. I can't fault any part of this movie. Every scene offers you something. If you miss this film because you don't like subtitles, you are a moron. If you miss this film because of something someone told you, you are a moron. This is one of the best films ever made. You simply can't ignore this film.",10.0,11 November 2005
Excellent second part to the vengeance trilogy,"A truly great, enjoyable and engrossing film.

The un-stylised and brutally real violence serves a point rather than for unnecessary kicks and thrills. Yeah, the protagonist is pathetic - but that's the point! Aren't we all bored of Tarantino's sucky heroine in Kill Bill who's so hell-bent on her revenge that she can take on nearly 100 Yakuza dudes and win? Revenge is petty, and Oh seems to think he can take on the world.

The brilliant scene where he attempts to take on a couple of dozen henchmen is superb! Purposely filmed to look like an old-school arcade game, it drags on for so long showing the hopelessness of the situation. Everyone is injured and falling over - they can barely catch their breath, but all they want to do is kill and maim.

I must say I am fed up of violent movies that serve no purpose than entertainment. That verges on sadism. Look at Bad Boys 2 - a huge pursuit across the city, where let's not forget countless cars blow up and presumably people die ('cos that's what happens when cars blow up) and what can Will Smith and his compadre do? Crack sniggers and make jokes.

Oldboy is a film that shows violence and revenge for what it is - pathetic and futile. Also, a brilliant story full of mystery that really doesn't reward the viewer for finding out the truth - just as is the case with the protagonist, Oh. I really enjoyed this film, was really impressed by it's originality and any negative feelings I got from the film seemed to be the point - to emphasis it's meaning.",10.0,24 November 2005
Didn't love it that much,"A bit of an unpopular opinion. Many praise this film and put it at the very top of various lists, for me personally it is ""just"" good. Instead of praising it for its cinematography, actors, story or twist, I will try to briefly explain without giving away the plot why this is not the best movie ever. Overall, watching the movie was a bit too much for me. I couldn't catch every detail on the first viewing, but it was better on the second viewing. Although I understand the motives, I still do not understand all the actions of the characters, especially at the very end of the film, which did not completely excite me, so I belong to the minority.",7.0,17 April 2024
Pure cinema.,"Even though I see where people are coming from, it's still amusing to see people complain about Oldboy being violent - Violence & torture has been widely discussed ever since the release of the movie. Every single review that Oldboy has ever got, made points about it. If you turn your clock and back to 1990 and read back the reviews for Pulp Fiction. You will find EXACTLY identical criticism - ugly, needless, pointless violence - do we really need a rape scene in a movie? Oldboy, just like Pulp Fiction before it, is a divisive entertainment. It does not celebrate the greatness of mankind and pats on our shoulder for watching it to the end, saying 'well done, see how great we all can be' kinda attitude. Instead it punches, gnaws and knocks you over until you are thoroughly battered and bleeding to the core. Some people love it or some hate it. No two ways about it.

And I'm firmly in the side of 'loving' it. When I watched it for the first time, I felt repulsed and shocked. Didn't quite know what to think, but I couldn't forget. Two days I found myself wanting to watch the DVD again. After watching it for the fifth time, I slowly realized it has that 'magic' quality, that something special which will last in memories of many, for years to come.

Style, music, acting and color. Oldboy is a supernova of all these, mixed into highly charged adrenaline pumping, kicking your gut, like entertainment. Even if you hated this movie, you won't be able to tear your eyes away from it, because Oldboy has the hypnotic quality like a sweet nightmare.

Oldboy will stand the test of time because it's a pure cinema of awesome quality, and if you can stand the heat, it's a movie to kick your head spinning and two days later you would be ready to be kicked once more.",9.0,9 February 2005

There's a thin line between being fiction (and every work of art it is, in it's way, fiction) and being just unlikely.In a more personal way, I just don't feel anything with the movie, it doesn't take me anywhere, and I just can't believe in the fictional world it is proposed.

Easily one of the BEST films I've ever seen.,"OLD BOY came highly recommended by friends who are Asian film fanatics. Now I see why. OLD BOY, a South Korean film from director Park Chan-Wook, is easily one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It's original, unpredictable, funny, realistically violent, sweet, sad, and it even has a message. It's brilliant!

There's not much I can say without spoiling the plot. Even the short descriptive text they used to promote the film says too much. Let me just say that it is probably the most creative revenge movie you will ever see. The set design is great, especially the penthouse condo. There is one special effects sequence (with an ant) that works perfectly, and provides a quick laugh in a moment of sadness in the film. The pacing is surprisingly perfect, considering the run time for the film is 2 hours. The acting is stellar. The struggle of the main characters was so real that I felt uncomfortable for a good portion of their interaction.

It also has one of the most realistic fight sequences I've seen on film. Where the main character defends himself in a hallway (shot lengthwise so you can see almost the whole hall at once), against about 20 thugs. I swear he actually makes contact with some of them.

If you enjoy movies, and you must if you are reading a movie review, you need to see this film. (10/10)",10.0,16 September 2004
Please watch it,"A man is taken, imprisoned and just as escape is imminent, released. By whom? Why and why again? It's a simple premise (based on a Japanese comic book), but it's the start of a complicated, involving movie. And I promise, it only gets better from there.

The main character of this movie is acted out by the amazing Min-sik Choi, who earlier appeared in the Korean box office hit, Swiri. He deserves every acting award (and even some to be created specifically for this role) for the mind-blowing rendition of Oh Dae-su - who undergoes a drastic change during his imprisonment. For such an impossibly difficult role, he performs brilliantly - almost inhumanely. I hope to see more meaty roles such as this (not the popcorn Swiri type) come his way in the future.

Perhaps it's hard to appreciate this movie against the history of Korean movies. It's such a new direction in many ways - basically all ways. The direction will blow you away - the shades of light, patterns and other bits that almost escape you, such as a fight scene along a hallway done in one long take. Chan-wook Park (whose previous works include JSA) has done an amazing job. The more I watch this movie, the more I notice and appreciate of his style and vision.

Perhaps I am biased in some way, because I find it hard to see fault in this movie - the acting, direction and camera work are brilliant. Having said this, be prepared for some violence, sex and some pretty lurid themes. If you feel like being surprised, watch this movie. Watch it a couple of times. It will blow your mind every time.

Excellent Film,"Yes! A complete 10! I truly enjoyed this film. It was worth the $35 ticket I found on my windshield after the movie! Everyone's taste is different, and its difficult to try and figure out who likes what type of movie. I'll just say that I'm completely sick and tired of typical Hollywood movies... same plots, same action, same dialog, same endings, same twist. Hollywood is like a big bandwagon cult where the goal is MONEY!!! Sure, all artists wish to get paid for their works but the entire creative process doesn't have to be based on satisfying the average consumer (not that Old Boy doesn't satisfy).

Overall, a great movie, great script, great cast... and yes, even the far-fetched, or not so far-fetched TRUTH in the movie. Perhaps some people don't get out much and realize just how screwed up some people can be.

Great ending but a laughable action scene.,"Oldboy is a great psychological thriller that will leave a mark on its viewers. The film's premise is really interesting as it revolves around a man inexplicably imprisoned in a cell for 15 years, without any knowledge of his captor's motives. Upon his sudden release he has a quest for vengeance. At the heart of Oldboy lies an amazing cast that each deliver great performances. Choi Min-sik's portrayal of Oh Dae-su is emotionally charged brilliance and Yoo Ji-tae's portrayal of Lee Woo-jin is very impressive.

One notable aspect that falls short however is the action. This is evidently apparent in the infamous hallway fight scene. While the concept of a single unbroken take to capture a action scene is interesting in premise, the execution feels extremely lacking. The choreography comes across as overly staged and it detracts from the overall impact of the movie. Every other action scene is passable, but there isn't a single action scene in this movie that is good.

That being said where this movie truly shines is in its ending scene. It is open to interpretation and will leave you pondering long after the credits roll. It's a testament to Park Chan-Wook's masterful storytelling that the conclusion feels both satisfying and unsettling.

Overall, Oldboy is a very interesting movie that offers a gripping narrative and amazing performances. The ending is positively thought-provoking and lingers in the mind long after viewing. While it may stumble in its action sequences, its overall impact is impressive.",7.0,19 April 2024
"Great technical work, a thrilling experience","Many IMDb reviewers apparently saw the movie because of the Cannes jurors' high praise. I believe their expectations were misplaced.

This movie is a technical masterpiece. Though critics may say the characters are ""cardboard cut-outs"" and the message clouded, this genre could not sustain any more than what there is. This film is simply not the *type* of art piece that many viewers thought it was.

As surely as The Matrix deserved its Academy Awards for its technical achievements including Sound, Film Editing, Visual Effects, and Sound Effects Editing, Old Boy deserves accolades for its technical merits. The sets, the lighting, and the visual effects, indeed, all of the production aspects make the film an incredible experience. Not a moving or touching experience, rather a thrill; an adrenaline rush; a jolt.

The film does not relate to the heartfelt aspects of humanity, nor does it attempt to, nor should viewers expect such things. The film does speak of rage, subversion, antagony and revenge. And it does so wonderfully. Aren't these all aspects of being human? Because this film successfully explores these parts of the human experience, is it not art? A good piece of art? It is, so I highly recommend it.",10.0,31 May 2005
Even Monsters have the right to live,"¨ Even though I'm no more than a monster - don't I, too, have the right to live? ¨ Oldboy has become a cult classic among film fans because the images in the movie are so strong, raw, and nothing like you've seen before, that they stay with you for quite some time (and I mean ¨raw¨ literally because in one scene the main character eats a live octopus, how is that for a first?). The story is very original and the twists keep on coming as the movie reaches its climatic ending. Oldboy is actually based on a Japanese Manga written by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiva of the same name. This is the second of three movies that Chan-wook Park directed of the Revenge Trilogy; the first was Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and the third Lady Vengeance. I haven't seen either of those films yet, but critics agree that Oldboy is his best one of the three. The three are also separate movies so you don't have to see them to understand the plot. Oldboy currently ranks in the IMDb top 250 films at the 113th spot so as you can see it is a much respected film among viewers. This is perhaps one of the best Korean movies I've seen, as I really didn't enjoy The Host as much as almost everyone else did. I think this is a superior movie and much more complex as well. Yes, there is plenty of violence, but it is very different from other revenge films and it really took me by surprise. The plot is a very original one, it is developed really well, and I have to admit the less you know about this movie before you see it the better because the experience is very unique. My expectations however were a little higher for this film, but it didn't disappoint either.

Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) is the main character of this film. On the eve of his daughter's birthday he is detained by police officers for being drunk and for disorderly conduct. Dae-su seems to be the typical alcoholic who doesn't even know what he is saying and you can tell this is not the first time this has happened to him. His friend, No Joo-hwan (Dae-han Ji) has to come and bail him out so he can make it to his daughter's birthday. Once they are released from the police station, Dae-su decides to call his wife and daughter from a phone booth. No Joo-hwan takes the phone from him and lets his wife know that he is safe and he will be taking him soon, but when he hangs up there is no trace of Dae-su. He has been kidnapped for an unknown reason and is imprisoned in an undisclosed room. Dae-su narrates what is happening to him. He remains imprisoned for 15 years without having a clue to who has captured him and for what reason. His only connection with the outside world is a small TV. One night he discovers that his wife has been murdered and police suspect him as the killer because they have found traces of his blood in the house. Dae-su cannot wait to escape and get his revenge although he has no clue who might have done such a horrible thing to him. After a long 15 years he is finally released for no apparent reason and now it is up to him to discover why he had to endure such punishment and he is in search for revenge. After being released he begins a friendship with Mi-do (Hye-jeong Kang), a female chef who helps him investigate what has happened. The plot begins to develop from this point on with many twists and unexpected turns which make this a very gripping movie.

The premise for Oldboy is very original and the story really grabs your attention from the very beginning because you want to know what the heck is going on. Why would somebody want to imprison someone only to let them out 15 years later without ever explaining anything? As the plot develops the questions begin to be answered. This is not your typical revenge movie; it is very original and has many twists and surprises. It is also a very raw and violent movie so it is not for everyone. I really thought the weakest part of the movie was the dialog, but the good plot holds your attention anyway. Min-sik Choi does a good job as the main character as he is not your typical hero and has several flaws. He is more of an anti-hero. Some of the action scenes are made really well, there is one memorable scene where Dae-su fights a bunch of guys in a corridor reminiscing Tarantino's Kill Bill. Oldboy is not close to being one of my favorite films, but I have to admit that it is a very unique experience. The film isn't entertaining, it is more artistic than anything else and the final 30 minutes really were the highlight of the film for me. The ending reminded me of Shyamalan's earlier films like The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable because of the surprise ending.",7.0,16 September 2010
"Really, really, really, really bad.","I can't add anything to the criticisms of this film except to add my voice emphatically. This film is a horrible mess of mediocrity, hype and poor writing. Yes, it is very popular with youngsters (who are allowed to see R movies), and heck, if I were 14 years old I would probably find it interesting, too. It has shock value. However this shock value is devoid of meaning and purpose, much like if I were to bring a turd to the dinner table. Shocking? Of course. Intelligent and poignant? Hardly. Artistic? Don't make me laugh.

Please don't waste your time on this. I'm sure you have much better things to do with your brain. And yes, the allegations of animal cruelty are true. Apparently Korean law doesn't prohibit such things in cinema. But that didn't bother me nearly as much as how juvenile this film was. There should be a Korean law against that.",1.0,17 June 2007
"A stylish , gripping , twisted tale of revenge","Oldboy is a gripping ,terrifying and super stylish head trip of a film that features one of the most shocking and smart plot twists I've ever witnessed.

Chan woo park brilliantly drip feeds the audience the ever twisting plot in a mix of stylish visuals and brutal action .

Respect is also due to min sik choi for his ballistic performance as psychotic avenger , oh dae su. Despite the amount of people he savagely beats up, You really feel sorry for him as he tries to make his way through his crazy-ass situation.

If the revenge movie is a sub genre, then oldboy is amongst the best that that sub genre has to offer.

unable,"I believe I am unable to criticize this film. This is the future of film making and I am thankful that I was there when this new era of directing has begun. Definitely the best film of the decade and in the top ten films of all time. Some review committed the crime to compare Kill Bill with Oldboy... Please do not do this mistake yourself, Tarrantino is fun to watch, but this is the kind of film that you can watch it again and again and always discover how deep it goes . If someone does not like this film , I am sorry to inform you that you have absolutely NO idea about what is called 7th Art.

excellent story,"Who said that this is a boring movie is so wrong.First of all the movie is trilling and exciting.There are two or three scenes where you have to cover your eyes under the blanket ,but still it shows you how someone's mind works.The main theme is revenge and it is explained through the film from two sides :Dae-su Oh's and his kidnapper's.And what theme it is........The movie tries to explain how too much talking can turn your life upside down .Who likes Korean ,Chinesse an Japanese movies will certainly enjoy this one and who is bored of stupid American stories.The music in this film is beautiful and enriches the atmosphere of the whole story.It is worth to watch,one of better movies this year.",10.0,21 May 2005
Where do critics gain their knowledge?,"I found Oldboy to be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen and for simple reasons. As a student of acting and of play history, it amazes me how so many of the ""critics"" on this website view this movie with dull disinterest or even disdain. This movie captures the audience immediately with its breathtaking cinematography and inherent mystery, of which, I assure, there is more to be found. The film is best viewed in the original Korean with subtitles to get the truest performance possible (if you don't speak Korean, that is) from the actors who tackle emotional and psychological subjects reminiscent of Hamlet or Macbeth. The allusions of this story to the Dumas novel The Count of Monte Cristo do not diminish from this movie, but only serve to impress me further by the way a classic theme of isolation and vengeance can be built upon and heightened today, especially via the realm of South Korean cinema. The violence, twists, and revelations which occur during this movie are not of the same variety found in most cheap Hollywood movies you might see today because no matter how unlikely, or perhaps even implausible, they might be, they are only so because they are on the most extreme of human experiences. And, because of this, the actions taken by the characters all lie firmly embedded somewhere in the universal human psyche. The choices made by the characters are not nearly as far-fetched as those made by say the average character of an average TV drama, going into a ridiculous situation with ridiculous causes. Rather, these are characters driven by goals which stem from real strain built onto believable people. Every character has a journey, every character has a revelation, and every character faces them-self. To highlight the extraordinariness of this movie, the director and cinematographer were also clever enough to know when these moments are, and paint them with a clarity that can be summed up as other-worldly. Yes, the violence is shocking at times, and maybe it stretches one or two scientific concepts, but the movie is still in one word: artful. It is art because I am here typing this at 3 in the morning, enraged at how so many could pass this movie off as shock cinema because their puritan minds could not fathom so extreme a case as this one. What would happen if Andy Dufrain was not so sweet an individual, but one who cried out for revenge like Hamlet? That is what this story is. This movie is special because it touches on what most of us cannot even begin to imagine. I will not ruin the ending, but I will say that the reason Oh-Daesu is imprisoned is something that I think all audience members will leave knowing they are guilty of as well. Humanity is special. Oldboy is special.",10.0,13 November 2005
If you love extreme Asian cinema you will love this,"Where to start? If you are a lover of extreme Asian cinema like myself then you will love this no question. But where as excellent Asian films such as Ichi the Killer and Battle Royale contained non-stop ultra-violence Oldboy is different.

Oldboy is multi-layered in the sense that it has many different genres and emotional characteristics to convey. Firstly the violence is sparingly used and beautifully done especially in the long corridor scene, instead most time is used on Dae-Su's journey. It follows his search for truth, vengeance and what he ultimately discovers about himself and how shameful his life has been. Secondly it feels like more of a twisted love story as Dae-Su's relationships grow.

This film has carried lots of controversy, if you don't normally like these sorts of films look past the violence and controversy and see Asian cinema at it's best. 10/10 superb.",10.0,26 March 2005
Fantastic,"Well, it took a while for it to reach the stores up here in Chinatown, but it was worth the wait. I thought that my anticipation may have had me expecting too much, but I was wrong. It lived up to the hype. It's a movie that seemed to hit me once the credits stared to roll. At that moment I was able recall the entire film and recognize what a great piece of film making it was. I've heard there is going to be a remake, and I just hope they don't ruin the movie. I've seen a fair share of good films in the last month including The Man of the Year, The Piano Teacher and Palace II, and I have to say this is the best of the lot in my opinion. The Man of the year was also a great film, but the way in which the story plays out in Oldboy just left me wanting more. It is a must if you enjoy Asian cinema, and in my opinion the best offering from Korea ever.

I'm going to watch this movie again as I feel I'll be able to pick up on some of the subtle things I may have missed the first time. Buy this film now, or at least rent it",10.0,14 June 2004
Everything but the plot is superb,"Music, visuals and acting are all very good but are sadly held back by a plot that is mediocre at best.

I have no intention of viewing the movie ever again, but I might listen to some of the music.",6.0,16 October 2020

Awesome movie with a lot of twists...,"I thought the movie was really good... but I will watch it again to make sure I understand it completely. I get the main story of the movie, there are just a couple of things about it that I feel I didn't get an answer for.

It is about a man who gets kidnapped the day of his daughters third birthday, and wakes up locked in a hotel room... his captors keep him there for 15 years and then just let him go. He now goes out to find out who stole 15 years of his life and why.

It is a controversial film with some scenes that will stick in your mind. The story is really good and the cast were really good.

This film was made in Korea and is spoken in Korean with English subtitles.

Apparently it is part 2 of a trilogy, but I didn't know that when I watched it and it didn't ruin it for me... but it does make me want to watch the whole trilogy.

The whole film kept me guessing and wondering what was happening and why he was kidnapped etc... when I got to the end of the movie I was shocked. It was a really good twist ending to a movie. I recommend this film to anyone who likes thrillers and doesn't mind subtitles.

I give this film a 7 out of 10... the rating might be higher when I watch it again though.

Plus, there is a live Octopus being eaten too... gross! :)

Didn't live up to my expectations,"This movie let me down. I'd read promising reviews for it online and actually found it in the 'employee picks' section of the rental store. I'd already seen Park's ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"", so I had an idea of what I was getting into. Oldboy is better, but not by much.

The graphic violence seemed cheap and unoriginal. I think the movie tries not-quite successfully to be shocking in the same way Miike's ""Ichi the Killer"" was. Actually, some of the best scenes in ""Oldboy"" (e.g. the penthouse one) reuse elements from ""Ichi"", which is a better movie that came out 2 years earlier (2001).

The story has an original twist I didn't see coming. That may have been because I nearly fell asleep before the surprise was revealed. The plot beckons back to events that happened in high school (the title 'Oldboy' = 'alumni'); this was a mild detractor for me since 'high school drama' strikes me as trite. If you can stomach high school awkwardness and are already reading subtitles anyway, you might be better served by 'Battle Royale'. I'm told Park's ""Joint Security Area"" is nothing like ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" and ""Oldboy"", which means there is still a fair chance I'll check it out.",3.0,25 March 2006
"Great movie, squeamish beware!","As opposed to some of the other reviewers, I found this film to be fascinating and enigmatic. It's surreal plot and philosophical dialogue, while certainly over-dramatic and at times outright ridiculous, leave the audience with a sense of the powerful emotions involved. On the outset, the plot seems crass and absurd, but when you look deeper into the characters you see a powerful movie that depicts the gamete of human emotions in a vivid and incredible way.

I found some of the material to be a bit unnecessarily depictive, but at the same time I'm not really sure if this could have avoided due to the graphic nature of the story. If this movie is lacking anywhere, it has to be in it's continuity. At times the transitions seem forced and the tension loses momentum briefly, but I think this is made up for in overall effect.

This movie isn't for the squeamish, as it depicts violence and sex quite boldly, yet it's subtle commentary on the nature of sin, repentance, and justice is quite compelling. Definitely worth watching at least once as long as you can handle the disturbing material.",9.0,26 January 2007
a truly different film with an eastern take on drama,"Now I love my films, but I have never really thought of eastern films being very good until recently. Couching tiger was OK and getting better but someone told me about old boy and it rocked my mind! A very sick but gripping film about love and violence with some gripping fight scenes and a man driven mad by revenge. The film also has a lot of eastern culture which I like as I feel that America has dominated the film scene for so many years a lot of people never watch anything apart from blockbusters from Hollywood, which in my opinion are always rubbish. a really good watch and definitely worth buying on DVD and showing ya mates!",10.0,22 August 2006
All round entertainment,"In opposition to the previous comment. I think this film has deserved every award it gets. Films of this nature are on the increase and old boy is just setting another mile stone. All I can say i'm not in anyway a major film critic, I just like watching films. If you haven't watched any films like this before then I suggest you watch with caution. Especially if you are upset by easily upset by animal cruelty and gore. Films of this genre are purposely set to cause controversy which is why on the up hand i enjoy watching them. Among the violence, old boy portrays an interesting psychological outlook to a person who has been isolated for years and suddenly released. I enjoy the fact that when I watch films like this one I can think about it afterwards and even try to put myself into the characters position, what would you do in that situation? In summary this film is thought provoking and interesting to watch as well as adding the much loved violence and graphic nature of the genre. Although Iwould definitely not call it family entertainment :)",9.0,7 October 2006
fine film,"i really liked this film. i know nothing about Asian cinema but took this in when it showed at the Glasgow tartan film festival as there was nothing else on. The guy who plays the lead role did an excellent job playing the hero of the movie that you actually don't particularly like. OK , this movie is a bit pretentious at times with flashy music and camera angles, but this adds to the whole effect of the film - that it is a bizarre and surreal story.i also thought the ending of the movie was great, because it is neither the one you expected or wanted. this is rarely done in films these days and i left the cinema wishing there was a sequel so i could see 'old boy' in another mad adventure. overall a top notch film that mixes adventure , mindless violence,fine acting and a bizarre story.Excellent.",10.0,18 April 2006
Incredible,"A man is kidnapped and locked away, without any idea why or for how long. 15 years later he is released, and vows to find his captors have his revenge. Sounds like a pretty basic plot, right? You couldn't be more wrong.

I was really surprised by Oldboy. I'd read plenty of reviews calling it a masterpiece, an instant classic, the ""best movie ever"", etc., but I never imagined that I really would be this good. The actors are great, especially Min-sik Choi as the main character.

There really isn't much else to say about the film. One of the best movies I've seen in a very long time.

And while you're still wondering that, you're released without explanations. Who did this? Why? What should I do? Did I do anything to deserve this? Let's see the movie and find out, shall we?

This movie doesn't have expensive special effects, big budget or well known Hollywood actors, but it can compete with all of them. It's just a great story. But be ware: this is not for the faint of heart.

An........Interesting Film,"So this was one of the first Korean films that I saw almost over a year ago and here are my two cents. This movie starts off great with, as previously described, unique visuals, great music, interesting plot and generating an overall good ambiance. However, it goes downhill, as our protagonist steps out the door, albeit gradually ending the film with one of the most random and unrelated endings that I have ever seen. I was speechless and after a few minutes I was asking myself, what the heck did I just see? However, I was compelled to see this film again and this time around I did appreciate all the beauty of this film and its boldness for its era. In conclusion, I really do believe that there is a decent film in all of this and that the two extreme ratings are not the only options. It is a matter of preference and how much blood and gore you can stomach to watch. Though if you are a movie fanatic and a huge fan of Korean cinema, I urge you to watch this film twice and truly appreciate its unique beauty",7.0,18 September 2012
Come on Hollywood!,"I think that movies like 'Oldboy' highlight the fact that if you want to watch high-quality, thought-provoking film, then you must first check that it wasn't made in America. This leads us to an explanation for the conspicuous failure of Hollywood to actually make any money for the last few years, and a criticism of the formulaic 'blockbuster' approach to movie-making. 'Oldboy' isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it is certainly a complex and unique piece of work. Hollywood should take note, understand that things like this can sell, and regain some of the pioneering spirit that built the business in the first place.",8.0,24 May 2005

The often discussed final twist completely worked for me and I found the film to be fresh, exciting and I was absolutely hooked until the end. Park Chan Wook is clearly a Director to look out for.

And perfection. In every scene. Gore - As perfect as any gore classic, romance as innocent as the most serene movies, action as raw as any Tarantino flick, style impeccable.

The sensitivity with which the director has handled such a sensitive topic (due to which the revenge drama unfolds) and the balancing of the mystery element till the very end, the last line spoken by the anti-hero, the realization of purpose completed......pure bliss!

Oldboy is the second film in a trilogy by Chan-Wook Park. The first film Boksuneun Naui Geot, or Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance which it is internationally called, is also a great film, but don't even think about ignoring Oldboy if you didn't like Boksuneun Naui Geot, because they are not even in the same league!",10.0,16 May 2005
Why Is This Rated So High? Because It's THAT Good!,"OLDBOY (4+ outta 5 stars) This is one of those movies that is just going to get better and better every time I watch it... I just know it. An incredible Korean thriller that really packs a punch at the end (though it is a very unconventional ending and bound to bother some people). I can't really say too much about the movie without risk of giving things away... but here's the movie in a nutshell. After being bailed out of jail on a drunk and disorderly charge Oh Daesu (Min-Sik Choi) is kidnapped and confined to small apartment where he is cut off from the entire world except for a TV. His meals are brought to him through a small trap door and every now and then he is gassed into unconsciousness and his captors clean up after him. After living like this for FIFTEEN YEARS he is suddenly set free with no explanation. He vows bloody revenge on the person who did this to him but he also desperately needs the answer to the question ""why""? To say too much more would ruin the odd twists and turns. The movie gets pretty nasty at times (explicit sex and violence) but is not a senseless barrage of constant action like some Asian thrillers. Watching it for the first time I wasn't quite sure what to make of it at times... but having finished it the first time I can't wait to go back and see it again.",9.0,11 January 2005

Ride the crazy train.,"Oldboy has the pace of a comic strip. In a fight I half expected to see exclamation of Wham, Bam, and Smash as Dae-Su charges like a bull in a china shop into a fight. Almost everything in this film is exaggerated. Even Choi Min-Sik's performance is over the top. In any other movie this would be a criticism. But Oldboy is an exception. The acting style fits perfectly in the extreme circumstances served up to the main character. View this film as a living cartoon and prepare yourself for some dark comic laughs.

If you dislike violence and taboo subject matter then stay away from this film. Avoid if you like a ending to a film that is tied up in a neat little bow. A plot with more twists and turns than a roller-coaster finishes with an ambiguous ending.

Watch this film if you like to discuss what you have seen afterwards. I was left debating revenge once the credits rolled. Revenge is the central theme of the film. If you believe in 'eye for an eye' then Oldboy might make you reevaluate your view.

If you like gore then there are a view moments but I actually think the gore factor is at a medium level. If Oldboy was a curry I would say it was a Madras in terms of goriness. I would describe the film as intense rather than a splatter-fest.

I find Oldboy strangely appealing and have happily watched it several times. For me a good film is one you want to re watch. Just avoid the remake. It is a meagre and cowardly effort in comparison.",7.0,2 January 2014
This is the best i have seen in a very long time...,"The story comes from a Japanese comic book of the same name, in which an ordinary family man is suddenly kidnapped and placed in a cell dressed up as a hotel room.

Given no explanation for his confinement or the murder of his wife, Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik) spends the next 15 years alone, weaving in and out of hallucinatory states with only a television to keep him company.

Dark and moody like a nightmare waiting to occur, these moments in the hotel room are some of the best in the film. The scenes, in which Park uses a collage of images to set the mood, play out like a Kafka story, with Oh unsuccessfully trying to come up with a rational reason for his plight.

An expert on personifying tragedy, Choi is at his angst-filled best portraying a man on the edge of madness. Oh is determined to one day find a way out of his cell and exact revenge on those responsible.

Between bouts of madness, he trains himself in the art of fighting, punching the walls until thick calluses envelop his knuckles.

Unfortunately, when Oh finally escapes and begins tracking down his enemy (Yoo Ji-tae), the film gets to feel a bit muddled. Perhaps it's a matter of having too much of a good thing, because the combination of the various elements doesn't completely add up.

Like different volumes in a comic book, there's something a bit stilted about the transitions and the resulting finale.

I was totally shocked after the movie. When the movie came end and the writings began to sliding down i could only look at the screen, just looking empty eyes... I stayed in that position for about 10 minutes. When I woke, the screen was black and i was still thinking about the scenes i have seen.

This is so magnificent, so brilliant, so genius.. I couldn't even find the right words to tell..

The best Korean movie in 2003,"Well, this movie is truly brilliant and fascinated. 'Oldboy' is directed by Chanwook Park, who also directed 'Trio','JSA', and 'Sympathy of Vengeance'. 'JSA' is the one that made me to watch and respect Korean movies because of it's style and well-develop story and plot.

Of course, Chanwook Park became my most respectable and honorable director in Korea.

After 'JSA', Chanwook Park released 'Sympathy of Vengeance', which wasn't succeed in public; however, I believe that this movie showed his own style, and created his own genre. Great movie that I actually want to show this to American friends.

His second chapter of 'Revenge' series was 'Oldboy'(2003). I didn't think this movie will succeed in Korea, but it was succeed. It is encouragement for the director, Chanwook Park.

'Oldboy' is well directed and stylized fascinated movie that I've never seen in Korean movie. This movie is the most intense, creative, and stylized well made movie. Moreover, it has own genre. I think it was possible to be succeed in box office in Korea because of the actor, Minsik Choi. His performance is the incredible and breathtaking. The best performance that I've never seen. I knew he is the best actor in Korea, but his performance in 'Oldboy' will knock you out.

Music is also well inserted in 'Oldboy'. Overall, this is the movie that I proudly show to American public, and it will surprise people that Korea has the director like Chanwook Park.

Stunning and disturbing,"I read in another comment, that this film is not better than Fight Club or other American movies. Fight Club was a good film, no doubt, but it did not in any way move or stir me as this Korean movie did. It was solid acting all the way and never in my dreams, would I have been able to guess this disturbing ending.

I can say I've only watched 3 very great films this year and none of those has been American. City of God, Whalerider and Oldboy.

After that he went into a complete different territory with the very dark, but excellent thriller Sympathy for Mr Vengeance.

Due to it's dark theme Sympathy failed to attract the repeated success of Joint Security Area.

Did that stop Chan-wook Park from making more movies?

Absolutely not!

Chan-Wook Park is back with a Vengeance himself giving us an incredible revenge masterpiece!

I wish I can comment more on this movie, but doing that could be a threat in spoiling this amazing experience in cinematic history!

Instead I will focus my review on the acting and direction of the movie. As many are aware now, the movie revolves around a man imprisoned in an apartment for 15 years. The motive of the movie is revenge. But the most important answer to all this revenge is WHY????

This movie will litterly have you nailed to your seat. Yes, it's very violent, I would say graphic as in the likes of Last house on the left, though NEVER exploited in that sense. This movie is all brains!

The direction is the first thing that will have you in awe. From the first 15mins of the movie, you will see how masterfully this movie is shot. In a split screen scene you will actually feel what this man has missed in those 15 years imprisoned in this apartment. His anger for his imprisonment, the complete mess in his look and clothes are all truly convincing by Choi Min-shik who has appeared in two other big Korean movies which are Failan and the award winning movie at Cannes last year Chihwaseon.

As I have already mentioned the violence is very graphic and will probably be rated in the USA NC17. Which is understandable. But do not be put off by the extreme violence. This movie is bound to have you talking and discussing for days if not for months. Just be very well prepared for the final shocking twist!I could not sleep at night after watching this movie!

Well done to Chan-wook Park you who has showed the world what a truly excellent film director he is. Oldboy gets a well deserved 10/10

"Truelly shocking, gotta love it!","How often is it that you can really, really be shocked by a film? Sure, it is never nice to see hot-boiled oil being thrown over somebody ( Itchi the killer), but to be shocked ethically, that never happens. I am dutch, after years and years of being challenged by dutch comedians, trying to shock you every five minutes, you become rather immune...or so I thought... This is a great film because it is unnerving, it confronts you with a different culture, and the end-conclusion of the main character is simply the right thing to do ( other then killing yourself)

Pre-pubescent boys will like this film,"Simple as that. If you're a pre-pubescent boy, you will probably like this film. If you're a female or an adult male, you'll probably be very disappointed. The rationale is this: the devices used throughout this movie are geared toward the vulgar and visceral (yet impotent) emotions. It's similar to ""potty humor"", except it's not meant to be humorous. People who think farts are hilarious will probably enjoy this film. And don't get me wrong... there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. When I was a kid I really enjoyed Knight Rider. But even then I was lucid enough to realize that I was enjoying it through the narrow perspective of male youth.

This movie has violence, gore, sex (incest, no less), animal torture and more gore. And the best part is that you don't have to think. You just sit and watch without any obligation to unearth any profound wisdom in it, because there IS NONE. So now that you know what to expect, go ahead and make your choice.",1.0,7 July 2007

"i loved this film, but i can see why others hate it","I loved OLDBOY, i couldn't get over how good it was. I thought it was superbly directed and written, and the extremely challenging role of Oh Dae Su was played with great dexterity and creativity. The soundtrack was fantastically atmospheric! However i do believe that the ending of the movie was a little long winded, and i can see why some would see old-boy as sadistic and gratuitously violent,but i believe its violence was necessary, i mean if i got locked up for 15 years without any apparent reason, i wouldn't exactly be blowing kisses to find out why. It also helps form the identity and develop the 'monster' side of Oh Dau Su, in parallel with the less sadistic 'sane' Oh Dae Su. Oldboy does in some ways have a message ""laugh and the world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone"" which helps our protagonist maintain his sanity during his captivity and eventual release. A fantastic film, the best foreign movie i'v ever seen, and so of course the Americans will make their own version, anyone smell a lookingintothedistancegrimacingwhilewearingovercoatstrippedofalldepth americanized remake? maybe its just dog sh*t",10.0,4 October 2005
It will get people talking,"A middle aged man is kidnapped and forced to live in a room for 15 years without knowing why nor who incarcerated him in the first place. He is given dumplings every day, and he has only the TV as a means of communication with the rest of the world. Then, he is released, and is along with a nice suit, he is given sufficient money for his personal use, only to learn that he has to find his captor in 5 days.

ChanWook Park's thriller that has captivated thousands and shocked or disturbed others is surely going to be, for better or worse, a big thing when it opens in select theaters in the US. Many of you have said that it sucks, and that it is overly ambitious for what it is. Well, I give you that: it is ambitious, but that it does its job. By no means is this movie original, nor innovative. I can name a few movies coming out of Hollywood that have done a similar job and succeeded as well as this one did. But this is no Hollywood. This movie has come out from South Korea (which by the way has been releasing countless excellent movies lately) and I tell you, in my view, it has rivaled (or even surpassed most) many big budget films that I have previously mentioned. This movie assures movie goers that one not need flashy settings, untalented pretty faces as actors and big budgets to make an excellent film like this one. It is not the best in movie history, it is not the best in recent memory, but it is pretty darn good to be the best of 2003.

If you didn't understand my point and haven't seen the movie, don't waste your time reading my post and go see it. You will thank those people who have given this movie nearly a perfect score.",10.0,6 March 2005

Interesting movie,"I watched this movie 4 times. It was interesting to find points that I had overlooked in the previous views.

Just one comment on various bells adopted in this movie, such as the chime of the hypnotist, cellular phones, door, bike, and etc. I thought about the importance of bells in our daily lives after watching the movie. Bells sometimes mark the beginning of a new scene in this movie. Oh Daesu was also conditioned to act as such after hearing the ringing sound of the cellular phone. We also begin and end some actions by sound (e.g., after receiving a phone call, we respond, think and act -- a sequence). In this sense, we are also conditioned to bells. In ancient times, drums or horns may have been used, while we are living surrounded by electronic bells (e.g., various alarming sounds in windows-based PC).

When I grew up in Korea, I hated hearing those bells everywhere -- home, subway, school, street, hospital, and even in Buddhist temples. I guess the director may have similar feelings on bells, considering he is of my age.",10.0,11 August 2005

Almost as intelligent as Paris Hilton's sex tape,"This flick is, quite plainly, for people who are easily impressed. How else can one explain it's sudden flash-in-the-pan rise to pop culture stardom followed by its demise into obscurity? It's for people with short attention spans, who are impressed by flashy weird scenes which carry no real obligation for the viewer to think. If I were 15 years old I would probably love this kind of flick because it's the sort of flick that makes you feel like you're smart. It does this by being so stupid. I could summarize the plot, theme, philosophy and artistry in one word: WEAK. Please don't be one of the fawning pop culture drones who adore this movie just because Tarantino tells you so.

Cinema Personified: Incredible Movie,"Rating: 9.5 Overall, a groundbreaking movie that helped give recognition to Asian cinema in the Western world as Park Chan Wook's incredible direction and writing makes this movie unique in so many ways that the audience has no idea what to expect next, especially when it comes to the ending.

Incredible Direction (Some of the best storytelling in cinema history as Park drives the narrative forward (on both a macro and micro scale) through the protagonist's view as the audience gets to see the twisted and skewed world he lives in, the fight choreography is incredible as the hallway scene is one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen on the big screen; has its own unique style as it blends violent thriller elements with black comedy elements), Very Good Acting (Great from Choi Min-sik (Plays a very multi-dimensional role very well as his performance is a real focal point to drive the story forward), Very Good from Yoo Ji-tae (Plays the antagonist very well as he works well against Choi and uses empathy well to make you feel for his character), Good to Very Good from Kang Hye-jung (Plays the female lead well as she works off of Choi well throughout the movie), Good to Very Good from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (A very iconic take on the revenge story as they lay out the story incredibly well and uses elements of mystery to help keep the audience intrigued about what might happen next; the ending twist is one of the best twists I have ever seen in a movie as they build to it but not in a way the audience would have expected; the character writing is incredible as the protagonist and antagonist are written to the point where you root for/against them but you can understand where they are coming from), Incredible Screenplay (The dialog was very tight and flowed very well throughout the movie; the interjections of humor were a great sight as they helped lift the tone from being entirely dark; the symbolism is incredible as it helps with showing the meaning and more about the flaws of the characters; the foreshadowing is very light (but this helps with building breadcrumbs that are later revealed in the climax)), Good to Very Good Score (Used well (especially in the fight scenes)), Great Cinematography (Especially in the fight scenes (with the standout being the one-take hallway scene); the facial shots help with showing how lost the protagonist's mind really is), Good Sound, Incredible Editing (Incredibly fluid as it helps transition scenes from one-to-another in a way that shows how one can be lost over time), Very Good Visual Effects (The GCI was a bit dated but the practical effects helped during the fight scenes (especially considering how low-budget the movie is)), Plot Structure was laid out very well as the plot elements were established and the story elements helped with building to these keep chapters, Pacing was very good as it was moving at a quicker speed to help build the suspense of the movie by putting you on the edge of your seat; Runtime could have been cut a bit as the movie does have some scenes right before the climax that could have been cut (maybe like 5-10 minutes worth), Climax was incredibly shot as the plot twist was unexpected and the reactions of the characters were caught very well; the come-down to the resolution was shot very well as it helps bring the movie full circle, Tone was a major reason this movie is so iconic/unique as it blends mystery/thriller/action/comedy all into one, Some of the best fight choreography I have ever scene (which helps bring the action elements to this low-budget movie)",10.0,19 August 2023
Masterpiece,"My dumb younger self watched this movie like maybe 10 years ago and decided not to watch it till the end and just didn't finish it after the hallway fight scene because I couldn't understand what was happening and what it was boring. And boy was I wrong. And even though it was a stupid thing to do, I'm glad I didn't watch it till now that I could actually understand the movie and appreciate its filmmaking.

I watched The Handmaiden from director Park Chan-wook a couple of months ago and I absolutely loved pretty much everything in that movie. Unironically actual cinema. It was so well-made and was shot so beautifully that even someone who doesn't watch many movies could feel and understand that it was made by an actual auteur and a filmmaker who knows what he's doing. You're watching a master at work.

And this movie is no different in how well-made and well-thought-out everything in it is. The story is so good and the editing, direction, and music are so phenomenal and amazing that makes this just a level higher than The Handmaiden for me.

The story is so good and the way they structure and tell this story is so amazing that even though the big twist was implicitly spoiled for me a while ago and I figured out what the twist of the movie was going to be even before watching it, the twist still hit hard and gave me shivers. The execution was just fantastic. It just goes to show that not everything is twists and turns, sometimes your story, directing, editing, music, and storytelling are just so good that it doesn't matter if someone got spoiled, the enjoyment of watching the film isn't lessened a bit. Though I admit that I wished I didn't know anything about it so it could've had a bigger impact on me, but nonetheless, it still hit like a ton of bricks.

I just want to once again praise the music of this movie and say it's one of the best soundtracks of any film I've seen and I will be listening to it for a long time.

The characters in this movie are really well-written and I think Lee Woo-jin is my favorite movie villain ever. I just don't think I can name another villain who's as psychotic and genius as this guy. The revenge plan this guy made is just mind-bogglingly convoluted and genius. He might not be the best movie villain ever objectively, but I'm sure he's in the top 10.

Overall, I enjoyed the sht out of this movie and I think it's a masterpiece and one of the best movies I've ever seen. With only two movies, Park Chan-wook became my new favorite Korean director and I think I even like him more than Bong Joon-ho, and I gave Parasite a 10/10! Bong Joon-ho is still a master director, but I feel like Park Chan-wook is just on a whole other level. This reminds me that I should watch more Korean cinema and especially more films from Park Chan-wook and also Bong Joon-ho.

Do not sleep on this masterpiece and watch it as soon as possible.",9.0,16 May 2023
Sad...,"I never write any comment for a film before, but I need to say something after I watch this film. Before I watch ""Old Boy"", I just think it's a ""Kill Bill"" type violence and entertaining movie. As the film end, I'm confused... I feel sad because I just watch the best film in my life and I'm afraid I will never find any film to compare with ""Old Boy"". Great story, directing, acting, visual art, music and almost everything. Choi Min Sik is really ""Oh Dae Su"" and he was locked up for 15 years, you feel his angry and all his violence action is a MUST. The final battle between ""Oh Dae Su"" & ""Lee Woo Jin"" show that Mr. Choi is the best actor in the world. After I watched ""Old Boy"", it's still in my mind for weeks & weeks. I recommend to all my friends and colleagues that this is the best film in 2004. It may be wrong because it may be the best film in your life. I hope there will be no remake of ""Old Boy"" in Hollywood. Although there are many good director and actor in Hollywood, masterpiece is unique. I don't believe anyone can remake such unique masterpiece. There's only one score can be given to ""Old Boy"": 10/10. My last comment: Please watch ""Old Boy"", it's the best!",10.0,19 November 2004
Oldboy worth watching,"I heard Oldboy was a movie that should not be missed. I couldn't agree any more with that statement. Don't let the simple premise fool you, this movie is quite complex. The visuals are innovative, and the various plot twists are unexpected. The final revelation especially caught me off guard. Also, two highlights that stood out for me were the octopus scene for its audacity and the corridor fight scene which was exceptional. The movie is far better than I expected. There is no way that the planned Hollywood remake will be as good or entertaining as the original. Oldboy is a cinematic achievement.

Seek it out somehow if you desire an alternative to the more mainstream generic Hollywood movies that are available.",10.0,4 December 2004
Look past the squid,"I can't believe NYT criticized this movie for violence and scenes regarding that live squid. It must be nice to have a closed mind and abhorrence towards violence when one is reviewing movies in the day and age of Saw 2.

When I first heard about this movie I thought it would be another one of those overtly shocking and needlessly violent movies but it was not at all that. The script was very tight, the actions were all justifiable and realistic, and the mood of the film kept me glued to my seat.

If you liked Pulp Fiction and the Sixth Sense, you will LOVE this movie, because it has the grittiness and the shocking twister that will knock you socks off. Of course, it was not made in Hollywood, so it will be a bit different, but then again, we watch new movies to watch something new, right? The director made another movie after this called the Lady Vengeance, if you liked this one, you will like this other Lady movie as well.",9.0,30 April 2006
One for the kiddies and your intellect,"Once you've seen this, you're going to be thinking about it for a while.

No, you won't simply be unable to forget it because it's unpleasant and blowtorches itself onto your memory; it's the thematic and character implications that remain memorable.

The film's premise is well known: Dae-su Oh is a philandering businessman and irresponsible father. Basically an a**hole, he has the rug pulled out from underneath him when, one rainy night, he's abducted and imprisoned in a private jail: no cause or authority given. Finding himself alone in a dingy room, and enjoying no human contact save dodgy food, kicks and gassing from his anonymous captors, Dae-su Oh starts to grow (unsurprisingly) unhinged.

Who did this to me? AND WHY? WHY? WHY? And Dae-su Oh gets plenty of time to ponder that question, because he is caged for some 15 years. During the interim, he has nothing save for the TV and some pads of paper for company. From the telly, he sees he is the prime suspect in wife and child's murders, and is now a wanted man. A seething bundle of psychosis by this stage, he begins to practice boxing, using the wall (yes, the wall) as a punch-bag, tutored by a TV sports programme. It Bart and Lisa from The Simpsons watched what he watches, one dreads to think

But then, Dae-su Oh is suddenly released, no reason given for this sudden ejection. Then, his nemesis gives him a wodge of cash, a mobile phone, a suit and a three days to find out WHY he was kept locked up. And Dae-su Oh is going to find out.

Chan Wook-Park's film has courted plenty of controversy on account of its graphic, almost comic-book style brutality, as Dae-su Oh beats his way through a long list of suspects. One seen in particular, when the exhausted Dae-su Oh scoffs a live squid in a sushi bar, has generated condemnation (personally, it's his table manners that offended me).

To get the most out Oldboy, you have shed any preconceptions and fears: take the plunge into one of the most twisted situations imaginable. Park quite literally turns the world upside down for Dae-su Oh, and I think his greatest achievement here is that the audience is likely to feel just as stricken and abused. Constantly the boundaries of your taste and integrity are confronted. Aside from the violence that Dae-su Oh wrecks, hungering for retribution, Park throws in a number of gut-wrenching situations that are intensely personal for the characters and for us as well. Oldboy is a film that has its head in the clouds and feet of the ground. Put simply: Park keeps this horribly, oddly easily to believe, because character generates incident.

However, I read in an interview that Park apparently comes up with his film plots in the time it takes to smoke a cigarette. It shows. Though hard to explain, Oldboy is not a homogeneous work. The narrative is sprawling and visual style, while frequently amazing, messy. Oldboy tends to ramble.

Worse, this is never as devastating as Park's second film Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance. It's as though Park took the flabby, humanist message from JSA and injected it into the disturbing premise of SFMV. Park tries to do too much in Oldboy, trying to marry thriller and complicated story and even moments of laugh-out-loud comedy, and it doesn't hang together.

Thus we are left with a bunch of moments, which are by turns repellent, monstrous, devastating, funny, upsetting and touching. Oldboy has one cohesive element, though: improvised weapons and torture methods. Toothbrushes, knives (classic), scissors, claw-hammer etc.

But I recommend you watch Oldboy. In the third act Park conjures up several amazing scenes that reveal the origins the animosity has led someone to exact a monstrous revenge against Dae-su Oh. If light is shed on the story, then the mental turmoil and confusion remain, best conveyed in a brilliant, Escher-like sequence.

Oldboy will stick with you. I won't and can't try to explain what's it really about and what it means, but any and all who see it will experience something different.

And to end this review, I'll say the climax presents a moment that is the epitome of human degradation and pain.",8.0,5 December 2004
Revenge sometimes becomes our ultimate mission,"What worked: Oldboy remains one of the most sophisticated and most disturbing movies coming from Korea, and Asia altogether not just for the project but also for the story it conveyed. It's disturbing in many levels, firstly the 15 years imprisonment and then the story they followed. This level of disturbing materials and making it to the top of many movie lovers list of rare across the globe, and maybe that answers why this movie is remade in some of the top movie industries around the world. Keeping the concept aside, it's a well written screenplay and well directed piece of work. The use of camera is experimented and it's done right. Some of them are extraordinary.

What did not work: I would have loved the movie even more if the movie added effects on the scenes, maybe sound and visual stimulations, or even tried to glorify some of the scenes. I think it would have worked as well. The movie garners extreme reviews; absolutely loved it or absolutely despise it. Either one is disturbing at the end Final verdict: highly recommended only if you are open to some disturbing concepts",9.0,13 February 2021
Only throw you back to meaningless darkness,"After watching this movie, I was so mad that I need to eat 78623765 sugar food to just be mad enough to write a review.

This movie did a great effort to build a whole meticulous process for the mind of the watcher, which contain curiousity, drama, action, etc... only to lead the watcher to some look like MeaNiNgFUl messages out side but stupid and meaningless inside. How cunning and pathetic the minds of the movie's father were at the same time.

The effect of the story in the movie must be very bad for a community. It seems to respect the family relationship, but in fact, it only damages these relationship by directly connecting intimacy between family members with sin.

Asia has not yet gone anywhere in the development of personal emotions and sincere emotions between family relationships. The culture here is mainly just bowing down to Confucian doctrines and family regulations. However, they have quickly made a movie that directly attacks the emotions between family members by showing that these emotions can go wrong, distorted, and easily manipulated to the wrong, distorted.

I must say that I, as a girl who grew up with the lack of love and intimacy from my father (my father went to work far away and he always were afraid to have intimate actions with me such as hugging, kissing, or rubbing my head), felt extremely angry when I watch them spread harmful messages about father-daughter and sibling love through their illogical, meaningless connections. Growing up under Asian culture, I always see it stupid when seeing walls built up between different sex members of family or friends. Looking back, I want to ask them a question: Do you only know about having sex and having war relationships? No friendship? No sibling relationship? No mom-and-son and father-and-daughter relationship?

And in another side, this movie is very harmful to masculine when connecting it with sin. It's very understandable with South Korea's country where people were lead under the hand of other country like American. It's like the man in the family must bow down so all the family members can be slave. It's very sad story for a country.

Maybe I came here toooooo late. If this kind of story appears in any movie this present, I bet it will receive frown from watcher and the authour will be seen as a primitive kind of mind.",3.0,18 October 2023
Loved the movie but no idea what it was about,"This is an excellent movie, which I really enjoyed. However, I must admit I did not really understand most of the movie. While it is a bit strange saying that I enjoyed a movie which is so hard to follow, there are a lot of reasons to like this movie.

First, it is not like any movie I had seen before. It is creative without being silly or indulgent. The director is continually having great ideas which on almost every occasion come off.

Second, the acting is quite excellent. The way the actors react to events is quite captivating. They do strange things, normal things and just everyday mundane things in a totally believable way.

Third, the movie has some fairly humorous parts, even though it is a very serious movie. Look out for a couple of scenes in particular, for example the octopus scene and the attempted seduction scene. Hysterical.

Finally, the use of colour in the movie is very effective. Most of the movie is characterised by loud, vibrant colours. However the director sometimes uses black and white and duller colours to excellent effect.

In short, this is the type of movie that you just can't turn away from. You will be continually asking yourself what could possibly happen next. I am sure that with each repeat viewing you will pick up many different things which you missed first or second or third time around.",9.0,28 October 2010
The Most Shocking Twist in Movie History (No Spoilers),"I have seen many movies as I imagine most people reading this have and I sadly, did not watch Oldboy until several months after I had watched (and loved, which I will explain why later on lol) the Spike Lee American remake. I have been on IMDB for almost ten years and haver felt compelled to write a review but my love for this movie over the years has finally caught up to me lol, So here we go.....

The movie follows Oh-Dae-Su, and I will say this before I continue, LOOK NOTHING UP ABOUT THIS FILM! If you are already planning to watch it stop reading this, and watch it lol. Now if your still around, worry not I will spoil nothing, and give only a brief description of the movie. OK here we go lol, the only thing that should be said about this is that Oh-Dae-Su, a man who has been imprisoned in what seems to be a hotel room with no clue as to who did this to him and why, upon becoming free is challenged with figuring out the previously stated questions I proposed, who locked him up, and why.

Anymore information beyond that and imo you will be doing yourself a disservice, watch it blind, its a kick in the pants lol. Now onto why I love this movie so much, aside from what has been obvious lol, I find the twist outstanding, horrifying and absolutely one of, if not THE BEST revelation in movie history. Which is really just the icing on the cake to a MASTERFULLY acted and directed film, cinematography is wonderful, and the everyone in the film gives a wondrous performance, and I wont even get into the action, Hallway Hammer Fight.

I couldn't agree more with other contributors, that the film is a work of superb surrealism, and therefore should not be taken as literally as any similar Hollywood offerings might. All in all, the best foreign language film I have seen in a long time. I would hasten to add, that the story itself is told in a fantastically twisting, to-ing and fro-ing manner which adds to the superbly crafted atmosphere of the movie. Superb!",9.0,22 October 2008

I have watched many films and when I rented this through Netflix so many years ago I immediately called every like-minded movie loving friend I had and watched it again. This movie has probably done more to introduce American people to Asian cinema than any film I know. The story is intense, the movie never lets up. You are literally held in this movies grip until the credits roll. The acting is phenomenal, the story is so original, the ending is unexpected and after a second viewing, it is perfect. Just watch this movie, you will not be disappointed. And make sure to watch it in the original language, dubbing would destroy this film. Next to Silence of the Lambs, I don't think there is any comparison to the quality of this movie. As a matter of fact, go buy this movie, watch it, and be prepared to be amazed and ruined for most movies you will watch after this.

Perfect Thriller!!,"Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) is imprisoned for 15 years and has no idea why. When he gets out, he starts trying to find the answers, and that is when the violence gets started.

Oldboy is a great film because it surprises you. It has a freshness and originality that ensure this. Part thriller, part psychological drama, never less than compelling. It's not exactly for the faint hearted but anyone who dips their toes in is in for a treat. It's an unique one really, that takes its own approach with its storytelling and keeps on doing its own thing throughout. It's unlike anything else which also makes it hard to explain why it works out so well all.

I also liked the fact that the director mixed in lots of humor even with all the over the top violence and that shocking twist at the end.

It's Asian, so you know that 90% of the time you are going to get something weird. Weird sounds perhaps a bit disrespectful but I mean this is a compliment really, since this often means you're getting something unusual, unexpected, unique and I just absolutely love it most of the time.",10.0,24 January 2022

The original is always better than the sequel.,"Altho I can't say that I did not like the american remake as much as this one, still, you can feel the originality in this masterpiece. Also it is obvious how Hollywood adapted the movie for wider audience, since this movie has 10 times more gore, sexuality and R rated scenes that are some points are hard to be watched. Still, the movie would not be even half of what it is without those scenes. The only negative aspect for me was the slow-tempo building which makes the movie a bit boring at some moments, that was not the case in the remake. All in all, a crazy psycho story that will bust you out of your shoes, great typical asian acting and a brutal ending. 8/10",8.0,14 March 2018
Unsettling and pointless,"This movie left me feeling sick and the reviews here made me sicker. The crux of this entire film is a disgusting twist that has no message or purpose, the only statements it seemingly makes are that the innocent should suffer for the moral failings of the rich. People here are singing its praises as if it's the second coming of christ but its just a pointless exercise in disgust. The reviewers that claim people are idiots for not liking it could be boiled down to narcistic incels hoped up on a film that portays the world like they wish it was. People are calling this avant garde and surrealist... what a joke, a disgusting twist with no moral consequence isn't ""avant garde.""

What makes this movie though is the story and sad twist toward the end...what a reveal. I had guessed that they may do something like that but that was only a passing thought in my mind, the movie still did its job with shocking me.

A true piece of Asian culture!,"This movie got everything that a good movie needs and deserves absolutely its place within the one hundred best movies of all times on this site!

It has its own and unique character because of a typical Asian strange atmosphere, an excellent acting, some very good ideas and interesting twists throughout the movie. You have a twisted revenge story mixed with a fatal love story in a very philosophical and moral context that makes the viewers judge and think a lot. Topics and antithesis like future and past, love and hate, revenge and forgiveness are all covered by the story and lie much closer than one may expect. The topics and the story with all its twists are complex, but very easy to understand for everyone and it is easy to approach to this movie although it is a very unique and special one. Even after several views, the movie remains profound and surprises you and is still entertaining - no matter for watching it alone at home or during a little alternative DVD night with friends with whom you may surely discuss about this piece of art!

The film is a rare masterpiece, heavy and disturbing, but not because of a few very well done gore and action scenes, but because of the profound and twisted stories of the main characters who are all lost sinners in a very fatal way. The movie has the class to be more than an inside tip but a mainstream movie, but in the same time, the movie is far away from the ordinary revenge stories and doesn't deny his Asian flows and roots. It is a very intellectual, philosophical and personal movie, but some excellent, absurd and even artistic action, crime movie and horror elements keep the tension high so that this movie doesn't have any lengths. It is more than an entertaining movie and when you've seen it once, you will surely fall in love with it and this film request multiple viewings!

It is fascinating how profound and artistic the Asian cinema is in comparison to a too serious European cinema and a too superficial North American cinema an this movie is an excellent example for this fact and may convince you to get more connected to the Asian cinema. Let's hope that there will be no American remake because of this movie's international inside success, because they won't be able to create the same kind of uniqueness and atmosphere. This movie is a true piece of Eastern culture!",9.0,20 August 2010
The film I want to forget...,"...so I can enjoy it again as well. This film is so remarkable. I remember, watching long lists about great thrillers. And Oldboy always marked it's place on those lists. Why? I mean, it is a South- Korean film, with no famous actor, or a director. ( I live in Hungary, Europe, and mainly all we get is western media, which I do not intend to rate right now). So there's this film, I never heard about. Ever. One day in work, we were talking about a topic that does appear in the film (won't spoil it), and a friend of mine asked me some time later, if I have seen Oldboy? I said no, because, why would I have seen it? No one mentioned it, earlier. He did insist me to watch it. I wasn't sure why he mentioned it until (Spoiler) part of the film happened. It was neutral to me, at the beginning. A Korean man locked up in a room for 15 years, without any knowledge why he has been imprisoned. Interesting idea, with quite funny monologues (Hungarian dubbed). He swore revenge on the person, who did this to him. He gets out, eventually, and planning to have his redemption. Gets to meet with a nice girl, who helps him. Also, gets Intel/offer/order from his kidnapper... Now that is fascinating for me. It's images, references for history and myths, the monologues, and the revelation at the end... Wow. THE FILM I WILL NEVER FORGET, unfortunately. Because it made a deep mark on me, and the way I watch films. It is not for everybody, because I'm afraid, not everyone can understand it. I hope for the best.

Korean Cinema gifts the Most Stunning and Savagely Emotional Revenge story of this Millenium.,"OldBoy (2003) : Brief Review -

Korean Cinema gifts the most Stunning and Savagely Emotional Revenge story of this Millenium. I am stunned... Totally stunned. It took me couple of minutes to become normal afte that shocking finish of Oldboy. A planned vengeance crosses all limits imagination but suits the actual misdeed. A protagonist is kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years and then released to find his captor and the reason for why was he imprisoned for such a long time ultimately end up finding his own culpability done years ago and having contrition. I never ever thought in my life that Revenge can be so brutal and filthy but of course the misdeed was no less. The story unfolds like a mystery tale and keeps you hooked until the mystery is revealed and when it is reveled you will find it as The Most Stunning thing you have seen in recent years. The writing so perfectly balances all the things like the level of Revenge, human emotions and making justice look intellectual to the right person. OldBoy is without any doubt one of the finest writing in recent time. It may be brutal, disturbing and sexually explicit but that's where all the realism and the feel is stored. The cast is fabulous and so does the direction. Chan-wook Park didn't lose time in useless things and focused fully on the content. Especially the last 40 minutes of the film takes it on whole new level. I have seen many Classic thrillers so it could have been little predictable for me but Oldboy still had plenty of mind-blowing twists left even after that. At one moment i even thought of even more brutal and savage ending but then the human emotions came across my way and Oldboy ended on a Strong note. Oldboy is a Must Watch and believe me you will not witness such revenge saga anytime soon. A MASTERPIECE !

This film has a distracting and disturbing atmosphere, which is in fact an enigmatic and psychological movie. Such a precise narrative that the final scene of the film is very impressive and madly. The Prison at the beginning scene is a symbolic mental space that is in fact an exciter that has grown in his subconscious for revenge. His instincts have strengthened and his revenge and instincts have become part of him and now he is ready to be satisfied. In the following, we enter the second phase (modern and civilized society) which allows him to satisfy his instincts and revenge. In the end, the real prison appears; feeling the dichotomy of existence and absence, love and hate, retaliation or victimization and paradoxes of this kind that today are in contact with them.",10.0,24 May 2020

That's what Oldboy is all about. The movie just keeps you hooked for the entire two hours (approx) and you are amazed at the originality of the script, action sequences, and acting.

Why to watch Oldboy: The movie is different from mainstream commercial Hollywood Its Korean and it scores over many Hollywood action flicks The originality of the script A very few loop-holes in the script Good action scenes

Why not to watch Oldboy: (Very difficult to cite reasons here) If you are a normal movie fan If you hate Korean people In case you hate watching movies while reading sub-titles

there are gritty things to discover,"I've heard of Park Chan-wook's ""Oldeuboi"" (""Oldboy"" in English) for years but only now got around to seeing. What a movie! I don't think that I've ever seen anything so intense. Park's neo-noir masterpiece manages to be the perfect combination of surreal, gritty, cynical and steamy. Like ""Squid Game"" and a number of Bong Joon-ho's movies - and probably other movies from South Korea - it paints a grim picture of that country, depicting it as tainted by corruption (and if your response is that it's a different culture, I'd like to remind you that corruption has the same result no matter where you are).

Not surprisingly, this movie turned up in Steven Schneider's list of recommended movies, and appears on IMDb's top 250. It's certainly one that any film buff owes it to themself to catch. Maybe it's even one that'll force you to ask a few questions about what sort of society you live in.

Rating: 4.5/5

South Korean filmmakers know how to keep a secret hidden in any film. They indeed appear like detectives when they write such films...I mean make such films. OLDBOY is a classic South Korean action thriller which has been acclaimed all over the world. It changed the way world looked at the South Korean Cinema. This film is undoubtedly from the genius Park Chan-wook, who gave us the emotional action thriller SYMPATHY FOR MR VENGEANCE. This film has excellent action which is perhaps the most classic you've ever seen in a South Korean film.

Choi Min-sik is not just an actor, he's something lot more than that. Just watch the film and then you'll believe me. He's perhaps one of the most natural actor I've ever seen. This is his best performance till date. Kang Hye-Jung is excellent and has a great role which she plays effortlessly. Yoo Ji-tae is just brilliant: his best act is in the climax which you're bound to love.

The screenplay of the film is never disappointing at all. It never deviates from telling us one of the biggest tales of all time, and it fully engages us into watching it till the end. The action is seriously classic and mindblowing. The visual effects are terrific, as is the cinematography. The natural humour present throughout the film is decent, as is the portrayal of human emotions in the most realistic and effective way.

There are literally no more words I can have for OLDBOY except ""Intelligent, classic, entertaining masterpiece.""",9.0,21 August 2017
"Oldboy is one of those movies that leave you speechless, with your mouth open wondering why.","First of all, it should be noted how brutal and heartbreaking this film can be. This is not only due to a high graphic content, but because of the rawness of the script and its rhythm. In the same way, in my opinion, the harshness of the script makes it, the highlight of the movie and what impresses you every minute through the changes that happen.

Min Sik-Choi's performance, as normal, is incredible, probably his best performance, showing a broken man and the madness than this entails. In the same way, the rest of the cast supports his performance in an excellent way making the film even more round.

It is also worth talking about other aspects such as the soundtrack, which immerses you even more in the story that is being narrated in an incredibly beautiful way. We also find a spectacular photograph with an incredible composition and a magnificent scenographic production, with a costume design, makeup and hairdressing that makes it even better.

In conclusion, we see one of the best movies of the 21st century, letting us see that there is more cinema than Hollywood and its monopoly production. A magnificent movie that leaves no one indifferent.",10.0,3 August 2020

Littleboys.,"First, please don't take this review personally. Unless of course it fits. I have met two people who liked this poorly made movie. Both were 14 year old boys who were going through their ""rebellious"" phase (but not cool enough to be rebels themselves). I asked them why they liked this movie, and they said (in a genuine Beavis & Butthead way), ""It's COOL heh heh heh! Dude nails his own daughter heh heh heh!""

People, that's about all that this movie has. It is rather pointless, unintelligent and visually uncreative, but due to the fact that ""dude nails his own daughter heh heh heh"" and other adolescently provocative elements (like torturing live animals and 20 gallons of blood), it seems to have achieved internet fame.

I strongly urge you not to waste any time or money on this film, and if your children want to see it, smack them really hard and tell them, ""Not until you've grown up into a fully-grown idiot. Now finish your asparagus."" Do. Not. Waste. Any. Time. On. This. Pointless. Boring. Movie.",1.0,16 July 2007
The Pinnacle Of Dark Movies And South Korean Cinema.,"One of the most shockingly brutal sequences my eyes have witnessed on screen? Yes. Top 5 moments of someone wreaking vengeance? Undoubtedly. Memorable scenes? A handful would be too small a number. Dialogue and screenwriting? Excellent. An unforgettable action scene? Top notch. Raises some unpleasant philosophical questions? Rarely running out of them. And the list of great cinema attributes this movie gets right can just keep going...

I've never noticed that before but one of my various grounds for worshiping South Korean Cinema is that Korean directors seldom ward off a chance to tell a dark story or present a harsh reality, usually in a manner Hollywood would distort so that people do not feel offended. Here violence feels like violence, truths feel like truths, it is terrifying and horrifying and grim, hence their better resemblance to the hideous sides of real life. The only cinema of the world that is partly similar to this is Swedish Cinema but in an a different way so they are hardly comparable.

For a film to have one of the best 3rd acts and twist endings I have ever seen is one thing, but to build up to it with a phenomenal 1st and 2nd act seems almost imaginary. Plenty have films have hooked me in only to loose me at the end (or vice versa), but oldboy is a pleasantly surprising exception. Great acting, great fighting choreography and great cinematography are only some of the many reasons that puts this film on a list of my top 10. Just like I think a show like death note is a great introduction to anime, oldboy is one of the best films to watch before getting into foreign cinema and dare I say cinema as a whole",10.0,22 April 2019
Just a bridge between two masterpieces,"Differently from previous ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"", Park Chan-wook's iper-realistic and brutal aesthetics here becomes dynamic and puzzled, as its violence gets more spectacular than estranged, so more involved in entertainment than in reflection: in this sense it's an achieved film for the way it manipulates, even with a great dodge, the attention of the audience who never gives up in the suspense crescendo, plot twists, flashbacks, all mixed by sapient editing just to get us curious and intrigued. Anyway the extreme violence becomes pathetic, really excessive if not justified, self-satisfied in sadistic incursions in bad taste and in a mannerism end to itself, surely of great impact for the ability of director to shock and wonder, but not always necessary. After all the narrative machine, cerebral, confused, studied like a glove with that modern and Hollywood-a-like attitude to plot twist and ambiguity, doesn't betray the comics' source with frame shots and parallel chronological structure, but even with a certain, overblown absurdity which often cuts off of the film, visually sensational, a kind of honesty. Chased by apocalyptic music, macabre game of incest and blackmails, punishments and tortures, violence against himself, against next in line, against animals (the protagonist eat a living octopus), has some inventive flash, it's cathartic as Greek tragedy source (Sophocles' ""Oedipus the King""), but even if the passionate audience sews the wires of the story and characters, gets order in the chaos and fins solutions to the enigma, something is still missing, something unachieved and unobserved: an authentic verisimilitude for this delirium, which goes over the equilibrium between Dionysian and Apollonian , giving up to this last one and to a muddled work of mind. By the way, it's a great actor performance for Choi-Min Sik, in a still significant artwork from a certain Asiatic cinema, and from an extraordinary director. In his trilogy, this film in the middle is the less deep and the funniest one, the one in which he dared the most in terms of style and provocation, but even the most commercial and mainstream, in Tarantino pulp era.",8.0,12 April 2013

You also find out by the TV that life is changing and that your wife is murdered and they say it was you. Yet it can't be because you are locked up. What do you do to keep yourself sane.

Title: Oldboy - A Cinematic Masterpiece of Topographical Brilliance,"Oldboy, the Korean film directed by Park Chan-wook, is an extraordinary cinematic achievement with a unique topography that's both visually and narratively stunning.

The movie's visual topography, brought to life by Chung Chung-hoon's brilliant cinematography, captures the gritty beauty of Seoul with both elegance and brutality. Notably, the iconic hammer fight scene, shot in a single take, is a testament to the film's technical prowess.

Narratively, Oldboy's topography is a winding maze of suspense, moral complexity, and emotional depth. It follows Oh Dae-su, played by Choi Min-sik, on a quest for revenge that leads to unexpected twists and a thought-provoking exploration of the human psyche.

The film's thematic topography delves into the dark side of humanity, challenging the audience's moral compass with its examination of vengeance and obsession.

Cho Young-wuk's haunting musical score perfectly complements the film's topography, enhancing its atmosphere and emotions.

In summary, Oldboy is a cinematic treasure that immerses viewers in a unique topographical journey through the complexities of the human experience. Park Chan-wook's masterpiece is an essential entry in the world of cinema, leaving an indelible mark on film history.",10.0,27 October 2023

Is this the greatest film Tarantino never made?,"No doubt about it, OldBoy is all about extremity. You want torture? Try getting your head around the idea of being in solitary for 15 years or the new dental work courtesy of a hammer. Violence? Check out the one-take corridor brawl in which psychologically ravaged Dae-su takes on a score of goons... with a claw-hammer.

You want to know how far someone could go to wreak revenge? Well, we advise you to brave South Korean writer-director Park Chan-wook's helter-skelter descent into the dingiest pit of human behaviour, even if at times it is tough going and ludicriously unfeasible.

As a sequel to the first in Park's 'Vengance' trilogy. We are greeted by a reality drenched in atmosphere and the grotesque. Like Se7en but we see the murders this time round. The live octopus scene and torture by hammer are without a doubt the most horrific moments. But there's plenty else to shock even without them - and all done with such unabashed verve that you'll be as compelled as you are repulsed.

OldBoy recalls Fincher in its CG-assisted flourishes and doom ridden themes, and Tarantino with its sharp-suited, stylised bloodletting. But it's unlikely either of those guys would ever be allowed to push it as far as Park has with this. Not to everyone's tastes, but if you have a strong stomach, OldBoy is sure to impress.

It grips you and never lets go as the mystery unfolds in a very fun, violent, kinetic ride that turns into the darkest, twisted tale of revenge gone haywire. Be warned-- get ready to be shocked out of your comfort zone as the schlock turns to psychological horror that makes your conscience cringe as you end up feeling violated.

Stylish!,"This was a real surprise to me. I'd heard various tales of how violent the film is and was expecting some kind of lame gangster thriller. In fact, Old Boy is a very handsomely made, stylish revenge thriller which has the feel of a David Fincher (Seven, Fight Club) movie. The production values are top notch; excellent cinematography and musical score, and a number of surreal, dreamlike scenes which create the kind of edgy, not-quite-real atmosphere which the best Asian cinema does so well.

There is violence in this film, and indeed violence which could be called gratuitous, but the surreal world inhabited by this story makes the violence less disturbing than than the kind of gangland unpleasantness seen in films about South Central Los Angeles or East-end London. This is a comic-book adaptation with a clear 'anti-hero', heroine and villain and it delivers a fantastic twist on the standard Hollywood revenge thriller ending. I hope it doesn't give too much away to say that, at the end, the villain dies, the hero lives and he gets the girl. But the circumstances of this denouement are so dark and twisted that it takes a while to sink in.

The most original revenge film you'll ever see--and the best.,"In Oldboy, the third feature from South Korean filmmaker Chan-wook Park, director of Joint Security Area and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Daesu Oh (Min-sik Choi) is arrested one night for public drunkenness and bailed out by a friend. He suddenly disappears and ends up in an apartment styled cell, where he remains a prisoner for 15 years--never knowing who imprisoned him or why--until he's released as unexpectedly as he was captured. Daesu's wife is now dead and he is believed to be her killer and their daughter has been raised by an adoptive family. He befriends Mido, a much younger woman who becomes immediately attracted to him despite his strange behavior and mysterious past. At first, he only wants to find out why he was imprisoned, but once he learns who was responsible, he feels compelled to seek revenge.

Oldboy is Park at his brilliant best. The movie is so visually inventive from the opening credits that there's never a dull moment in the entire film. His use of color and shadows is masterful and the score is fantastic.

The most amazing thing about the movie, though, is that Park is able to sustain the tension for as long as he does. During the film's climax, when Daesu finally confronts his nemesis and the story's final shocking plot secret is revealed, the movie reaches a point where lesser filmmakers would have found themselves in a corner they couldn't back out of, yet Park pulls off an ending that's satisfying, but without selling out the story.",10.0,20 August 2004
A work of Art (forget how corny that sounds),"I'm really surprised about how many people disliked this movie. I think people just missed what was really amazing about this movie. The story was only to drive it, to keep you wanting more, and the ending is just as satisfying as it needed to be. Perhaps no ""Usual Suspects"" but certainly up there. What was truly great about this film was the directing. I have not seen such an amazingly, and uniquely directed film in a very long time. Transitions, expressions, color, and almost every single shot in this film capture something that is new to film, and something that is hard to look away from. I feel though that some may disagree (due to the other comments), but I think this is because they were too focused on the dialog (which is no Tarentino) or acting to appreciate what was accomplished by this film. New technique and style has been brought to film, and without a doubt this movie will influence works around the world.

Pandora's Box,"If you can accept cinema is an art form and art can sometimes be disturbing, you may love this film. Otherwise, it's maybe better to stay away rather than watching this film and declaring it's very disgusting and nerve wrecking.

This is a 'black' film that disturbs and provokes. Revenge stands just beside the deepest feelings such as fear and passion. Mental processes, delusions and strong feelings are excellently filmed throughout the movie, it's hard not to question yourself while watching, what would I do if I were him? Flashback scenes are brilliant, especially the ones at the high school and elevator sequence of Evergreen. The way that Daesu, the man of conflicts, unfolds the mystery of his tragic fate is impressing. Step by step Pandora's Box is being opened and at the end, we even know what color the box is.

Oldboy's not another 'ordinary violent Asian movie'. It's too far from being ordinary. Blood that is shed is nothing compared to the mental damages given. It definitely carries a significant amount of psychological violence which is likely to occupy audience's mind even the movie is over. But it's worth bearing.",9.0,23 October 2004

Technically its perfect, the only problem is in the narrative, which is quite a disappointment to say the least. You spend the whole film trying to figure it, trying to untangle the mystery of his kidnapping and then when its finally revealed you are left feeling cheated, and robbed. To some it is just too much, it devalues the entire film and so the entire thing will be looked upon as a failure. However, others will overlook the ending, or at least come to terms with it and still respect its more brilliant side Oldboy walks the line between realism and insanity, yes it has its problems, but it also has many good points. It's the same with 'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance', and it is in 'Lady Vengeance' that I can only hope for a combination of both these two films better points with none of the negatives.

definitely at least a 9,"to try and contribute to the discussion whether the film is overrated, let's have a word on what ratings are supposed to mean: in my eyes, an ""alltime rating"" like this one should consider whether a movie achieved something more than telling a good story in nice images (always considering the background (for example the time) of its production) way more than personal taste. having said that, i also disagree on the overall rating at some points, for example when i see that a masterpiece like wong kar wai's ""in the mood for love"" hardly makes it into the top 250. in case of ""oldboy"" i don't see where this movie should be overrated - it just made it into the top 100 and i think it's well positioned there. oldboy is the second part of a trilogy on the topic of vengeance, and like the first beautiful part ""sympathy for mr. vengeance"" the director achieves to use highly interesting imagery, impressing camera work and cut, a ""close-to-arrogant"" amount of metaphors and all this on a very thoughtful, twisted plot. the NEW thing: it is not that weird ""art-cinema"" some European directors would deliver but still highly entertaining, telling strictly ONLY what is needed to understand the story. If you are a film freak, you will definitely not regret seeing this one, even if you don't like it - because from an objective perspective it is ambitioned and well-done cinema. if you just want to entertain yourself and you are into thriller/twisted stories and - basic! - you are not afraid of movies leaving the already known paths of Hollywood-storytelling-patterns, you will also enjoy this a lot.

grotesque mind game,"Chan-sook Park's 2003 cult film ""Oldboy"" tells the story of Dae-Su Oh, a Korean businessman imprisoned without cause for fifteen years. One day he is suddenly released and intent on unraveling the mystery behind the reason for his capture and to bestow vengeance upon those who imprisoned him. With every step he takes, a new mystery is discovered.

For Dae-Su, as well as the audience, the answers continually feel merely one step ahead. This is a classic revenge tale in the highest regard, but cinematographer Jeong-hun Jeong and director Park craft the film as something far loftier. Dae-Su's quest is one of self-discovery and bordering on the philosophical, as he battles personal demons and personal enemies alike. There's an underlying romantic element to the piece that is presented with the same delicate care as several rather gruesome and unabashedly offensive, but mostly audience-created, scenes.

This is hypnotic film-making in the best sense, psyching out the audience at every turn, and steadily escalating to a big, mind-blowing finish. Surprisingly, as disturbing as much of the material is, ""Oldboy"" makes for satisfying viewing.",9.0,6 November 2006
"A man is locked in a windowless room for 15 years, then released without warning. He looks to punish those responsible.","Oldboy is a powerful, intense story of vengeance, love and redemption.

Characters are strong and well developed, and the director holds nothing back, it may be too raw for some tastes, but it's this very shocking intensity that will draw you into the world of pain that the various characters inhabit. The soundtrack is phenomenal, I knew I was onto a winner here when I heard Vivaldi's ""Winter"" playing over a torture scene. The emphasis is firmly on story, above action, but it does contain one of the most original and well shot action scenes of recent years, anyone that's seen it will know what I'm referring to.

If you make it past the first 10 minutes then I think you can make it to the end. If you feel disturbed you might want to stop watching. It's up to you, but you might feel depressed and kind of ""stained"".

Superb action!!

I have read the other reviews on this site about this movie, and talked to a lot of other people who have seen it, and i think this is the kind of movie that you will either love or hate, or love to hate, or hate to love, depending on your taste in movies.

An excellent movie!,"I understand that most viewers hated this movie for its violence or harsh content (most of it implicit, though). However it is wrong to say that this movie is just 2 hours of gratuitous violence and that it's obscene and doesn't make any sense.

Oldboy is one of the very rare movies that I have seen recently that are totally original. At first, the plot may give you the impression that the movie is really stupid and lacks sense (""a guy is locked up for no reason for 15 years and now he's going to seek revenge""). Does this kind of plot, with an apparently dumb plot remind you of a famous highly acclaimed blockbuster? I'll give you a hint... KILL BILL !!!

OldBoy and Kill Bill are two very different movies, but they share a manga-like style, are quite shocking and start with a weird plot.

The main difference is that Kill Bill's plot gets worse and worse during the movie, ending with a phony love story, and that Oldboy gets better until the end, where you are overcome with one of the most powerful and original endings ever.

I think IMDb readers have a very naive sense of what is a good movie ending: they hate Oldboy (which has been acclaimed by most critics) and rate the ending of The Shawshank Redemption as one of the best of all time ?!? In fact The Shawshank Redemption is the most PREDICTABLE movie of all time..

Unbelievable. Watch It NOW.,"OldBoy is a film you shouldn't read about. It's a film you should somehow grab and watch. No research required.

The camera technique is fantastic and unique, with disturbingly eerie and suitable music to boot. The emotion of the storyline is perfectly acted out especially by the lead Choi Min-Sik, who personifies human vengeance with all negative human emotions and a touch of desperate dignified honour to the max. Although the characterisation is quite lacking, this film dosen't need it. Choi hasn't many words to build up sympathy and emotion for his character, yet he uses all the emotional energy he can muster and it shows. From his toes to this eyeballs, Choi plays a man with one thing in mind: Revenge. Yet unlike other revenge flicks, such an emotion is realistically portrayed with a depth I have never seen before from a single actor. Sadness, depression, loss, loneliness, pride, hopelessness, determination, irony, wrath. All with one word. One look. Only Choi could have pulled this off.

Director Park Chan-Wook has made a gem which should be remembered for the ages. The film moves along at full speed like a Tarantino flick, yet comparatively still seems slow and old-fashioned and dosen't feel like your watching a movie. The dialogue is cliched and metaphorical, yet it dosen't feel forced and over-philosophical like the Matrix films. There are many images in the film which will stay in your head for years.",10.0,20 August 2004

Brilliant in every way. One of the most clever films you'll ever see.,"Oldboy is one of Asia's most critically acclaimed films, worldwide, that has been released this millennium. On watching, it is not difficult to see why. The plot is quite simply fascinating to witness. The way it is unravelled, the narration and the direction are all fantastic; it is gripping to the point where almost two hours fly by without you even noticing. The way Chan-Wook blends past flashbacks with present goings on is very smooth and does well to further show off his obvious directing talents. The revelations at the end are extremely shocking but are done so cleverly that despite how the audience may feel about the issue in question, they must at least be impressed with how it is presented. Park Chan-Wook really does deserve an applaud for his directorial efforts in this film as it is such a stylish masterpiece and really focuses on the details, taking great care in making a great film.

Inside the amazing plot are two fascinating relationships. The main relationship is between Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), the main character, and Mido (Gang Hye-jung), a young woman who befriends Dae-su. The way they are strangers who immediately fall in love is very intriguing and their storyline develops fascinatingly. The other is between Oh Dae-su and Lee Woo-jin (Yoo Ji-tae), the antagonist. The way how Oh Dae-su's quest for vengeance is only greatened by his quest for the truth from Woo-jin is understandable and Woo-jin's complex character makes him almost a sympathetic character. Add a couple of thoroughly entertaining and well choreographed fights and some shocking imagery and you have a classic Asian film in the making. The score is intensely dramatic in parts and the frequent use of a piano adds a lot of depth to the overall atmosphere of the film. All the reasons why Asian cinema is very popular beyond its own continent are prominent in this film.

The acting by the leads in Oldboy are also excellent and done extremely convincingly. Choi Min-sik is brilliant to watch and is very convincing as Oh Dae-su. Min-sik is very good as a man who has lost everything and who has lost his socialisation. His ability at displaying madness, anger, sadness, joy and ambivalence make his performance impressively versatile. Yoo Ji-tae is brilliant as Lee Woo-jin and provides a fantastic contrast against Dae-su. Ji-tae is often moving in his portrayal, despite the fact he is playing a sick and twisted game. The confidence of his display is very impressive. Gang Hye-jung is very good as the female lead. Her performance shows her character's loyalty and naivety on a very good level and her childlike looks make the audience care for her very much. The great casting really helps the characters come to life and bring the film's point across.

This film does very well at manipulating the audience's emotion and feeling empathy towards the main characters which is a very powerful quality for a film to possess. Oldboy is very courageous in the subject matter it explores and definitely benefits from not being too concerned with how the public would respond to this film.

Oldboy, at only three years old, is already a classic and is a near perfect film. Subtitles are actually a benefit because they make you concentrate more which is important to fully understand this film. Well directed and acted, Oldboy is a genuine masterpiece.",9.0,13 January 2006

A good art is not always a pleasant one,"Well, as the title says, I think that a good artwork in any platform is not always a pleasant one. To me, what defines any artwork ""good"" is that it has the ability to make us think about issues that we normally wouldn't think or care about.

Oldboy, to me, is one of those works.

No doubt lots of people would find this work distasteful, and I understand why they would think in such fashion, one of the reason been the high level of violence. But then again, since this movie is focused on the theme of ""revenge"", I'd love to see people express about their opinions on that they would do if they had been locked up in a cell alone for 15 years without any apparent reason.

This movie showed me, a unique view, something that one would not see in normal daily life. A view from the mind twisted, hatred filled, yet still passionate man. It is chilling to see how 15 years of isolation can turn a middle-aged middle-class man into.

Chilling.

After watching this movie, it makes me think about how lucky I am that I have a normal, mostly happy life. Compare to the main character, we are all very lucky.

The movie itself handles the character emotions really well. The actors performed both positive and negative emotions flawlessly.

The music is great too, and the tone varies a lot. The last scene combined with the music, gave me a deep impression and after that, a long, deep sigh.

Personally I put Oldboy among the ranks of ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Godfather"", and ""Forest Gump"" as my favorites. Though they all have distinctive themes and different ways of expression, there's one common thing between them.

They all make me think, and think hard.

I certainly hope this film does the same for you.",9.0,14 September 2005

I can't describe too much without giving away the plot, but.. this movie was amazing. The twists don't stop either... all the way until the end there are things to figure out, problems to solve, and mysteries to be told. Go see it if you're over 21. I'd say it's inappropriate for anyone under that age.",10.0,2 September 2004

Grabs you by the teeth,"Oldboy isn't just great korean cinema. it's a great hell of a movie. You watch this one from beginning to end because you want to see what happens. This one is really dark and has tinges of humor to ease the ride. However, Chan-wook Park's style is no holding back and he tells this warped twisted tale. Is this movie about mindless violence and vengeance. It definitely factors in, but I felt it was about transformation. Daesu, played with gusto by Min-sik Choi, is such a perplex character that you find yourself rooting for him, yet appalled at his actions. He is forced to review his life (very involuntarily) and what he's become. I don't even want to go beyond that, but think about your past, your present, and the individual you've become. Are you pleased or satisfied? Would you have done anything differently? Would you reject people who you'd previously greeted with smiles and called friends or would you seek out those who you may have unjustly wronged? That's what Oldboy is about. The journey of life and the consequences of actions taken. That's why Min-sik Choi is so superb in that he really becomes Daesu and from the start to finish, you become fascinated, even obsessed with finding the path he takes. The cast work well here and this may be one of the most intense films I've had the pleasure of seeing. Oldboy may be a huge step for korean cinema, but it really is one fantastic movie.",10.0,25 February 2005

"If you didn't get it, shut up!","I've read quite enough stuff on here about how this film is badly made, unimaginative, sick, plot less, poorly acted and so on. I have no idea how anyone could seriously suggest any of the above, but I can understand that not everyone would like it, but that fact does not make it a bad film. In fact, this is a very powerful film, dealing elegantly with revenge and human motivations. The direction is very hard-hitting, pulling no punches and refusing to shy away from issues in the interest of not shocking the viewer. It certainly isn't for everyone, but you can still get 'The Lion King' on DVD, so stick to the Disney section and leave the stuff that needs a brain alone, you complete moron.",8.0,4 July 2005
"Great Movie, worth watching.","The two hours I spent for this movie definitely worth it, one of the most awesome stories I've seen combined with great acting and directing. I don't want to describe it scene by scene, so I can just say ""Unique"".

What I call a great movie has a profile which is; the movie should get you inside. In other words, while you are watching it you are living in it. Oldboy can definitely do that, just from the beginning it takes you in whether you like whats going on inside or not, you are completely in it and all you can do is to go with the magnificent flow of the movie. There are so much thrilling scenes that each time you think this might be the climax but no, it just keeps surprising you.The selection of actors is great, they just fit in to their characters, it can't be any better. The spectator goes through the agony that Dae Sue goes through at the same time you feel empathy for his captor, feeling sadness, joy and anger together.

To sum it up, I'll only use only two words ""Absolutely Magnificent"" and calling Oldboy a master piece would be just in place.",10.0,4 January 2006
Vengeance runs deep,"On his way back home after a drunken night out Dae-su Oh is on his way back home with a friend who bailed him out of jail. Then, as if things couldn't get worse, Dae-su Oh disappears... right from the street with no trace. The next thing he knows he is in an apartment style room and he is being held there like an inmate. He doesn't know who his captors are and doesn't know why anyone would put him in there. 15 years later he is freed and his wanting to figure out who imprisoned him turns into obsession when he finds out his captor's plans for him aren't over.

The concept of the film is quite simple and almost seems like a classic ""what if"" scenario - ""what if you were held against your will for a long time and then freed."" What would you do? How would you feel? The strength of the movie is that it also present the other side of that scenario - why would anyone do that to anyone else? How would they arrange it? The story of vengeance that unfolds ends up being as deep as the psychology behind it and that makes for a really fascinating tale. Then there is the cinematography which is just as effective with the hallway fight scene probably being the most famous example. But almost every scene or at least every key scene manages to stand out in its own way. The acting is also strong and even inventive, especially in the end scenes. It is not necessarily realistic, but the point is this is a story so it works to get its point across. Some have compared it to Greek Tragedian acting as it attempts to encompass the summation of a long story (Greek tragedies had far reaching back-stories referred to throughout, while here it is shown in the beginning) into one moment. And as mentioned before, the film shows these scenes from opposing points of view so the viewer is left neither in failure's shambles or victory's joys, but rather outside looking in on what happened.

That makes for a revenge film that is not about revenge itself, but examines the nature of the act. --- 8/10

The Greatest Korean Film Ever Made............maybe the world.,"Oldboy was made by the mostly unknown director and to many people this was kind of like a debut, well as far as kind of debuts go this is probably the best one of all time.

The film is visually beautiful, Jeong-hun Jeong does an outstanding job with cinematography making it look delicate and smooth and at time harsh and grainy. He really manages to match the photography to the emotion felt by the characters and audiences alike.

Yeong-wook Jo gives us an unforgettable score that fits in perfectly with the film, its very mysterious sound really sets the scenes and finishes them superbly.

A wonderful script/screenplay is delivered by a team of people including the director. The script is full of unforgettable quotes and is simply incredible at times.

Min-Sik Choi performs Dae-su Oh with perfection.

An unforgettable performance, an forgettable film, an unforgettable.....experience.

oldboy .....breathtaking!,"Iam may not be an interesting writer writing about old boy . As i have an engineering academic background , i would like to go down in points about how i feel good on this piece of masterpiece:

I) The background music is really enthralling.(that i had split the end part of the movie and convert it into mp3..and yes, i still do listen to it a lot... thinking about the last scene on the snow-covered New Zealand peaks).

II)The angles-of-shot were captivating ; and, if i were not mistaken the last scene in the penthouse ..about the 70 steps stuff... was copied by Kill Bill 2 .

III) The continuous fight scene in the long corridor...that was a revolutionary idea .

IV) The revealing scenes were great...though the causes were minute.

Since this movie marked a new era of movie production...i appreciate it a lot... so if any one can't appreciate this movie then either he is a holy child (Godly , not interested in movie) or he is dumb.

Some people commented on comparing Tarantino's and Oldboy . But please don't do so..i have seen all Tarantino's and i find them all vague and strange . They are all satirical based .(may be more like SouthPark).

But this movie is clear and simple and the fight scenes are more original and better.

The only reason that I observe as the drawback is the minute reason for vengeance upon Oh-Daesu.",10.0,4 February 2006
I heard ...,"I heard that Old Boy is being released in the US, March 2005!! I can't wait. Can you? This is by far the most anticipated movie coming out of Korea and Park Chan-Wook is a visionary to keep an eye on. He's shooting the third installment of this trilogy called SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE. I think SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is coming out in the states shortly after OLD BOY. If you get a chance, check out both films. I can't decide which one is better. OB is more plot driven where SYMPATHY is more character driven. They both have great cinematography (i.e. the staircase shot in Sympathy and hallway fight shot in OB). There's a reason Old Boy was QT's favorite film at the Cannes ...",10.0,18 November 2004
One of the best Asian movies of the new century!,"A Korean man named Oh Dae-Su was drunk one night until he has been taken away from his wife and kid as he has been imprisoned in a special small house-like prison for 15 years especially being mysteriously fed and bathed during those years in his cell and watches time change thanks to a TV in the room, after that he is released in 2003. Now that he's out back in the streets of Seoul with new clothes, cash and a cellphone as he faces some changes in the city since he was imprisoned, he now must find the person that imprisoned him then kill him.

Based on a Manga, this poetic Korean action drama is most definitely one of the best movies from Asia and of this new century! There's a certain Tarantino quality to it with the style of violence such as the pulling teeth out with a hammer sequence guaranteed to make anyone flinch since ""The Marathon Man"". The plot is a little complicated but there's some vicious action and themes to the movie in this grim and dark thriller that is bound to knock your socks off.

A must see!",10.0,20 June 2006
"Even if i am worse than a beast, don't i deserve the right to live?","""Even if i am worse than a beast, don't i deserve the right to live?"" this summarizes the theme of the movie. it is a humanitarian view on love, sex, ""morality"", respsonibility (to family and to others) and tolerance.

Oldboy is not about violence, and it is unfair to put this to the same category with fight club. it is about ""revenge"", that the best revenge end up as forgiving.

it has the best plot of all movies in recent years and it is beautifully made. incredulous yet the director tied all the knot so well that the story is convincing.

i will skip the storyline introduction as there has already been so many reviews and discussions about this.

A MUST see. days after you watched it, the image, the movie, the story will stay in your head.

****spoiler below to illustrate the points above****

on forgiving: -- the movie is about Woojin's revenge, and about Daesu's reflection on how he was turned into a monster of revenge.

-- it is about Woojin's forgiving Daesu and Mido, when he asked Mr Park to keep the box closed

-- it is about the futility of revenge, and wrongness of persistence on revenge, as demonstrated at the remote control scene

-- it is about remorse and the need to always try to see from your enemy's perspective, which is the reason Mrs Yoo (hypnotists) finally agreed to help Daesu

-- it is about letting go of your monster side, as Mido has asked Daesu to do when she suggested running away, and when she prayed for Woojin and Daesu making peace with each other

-- and many more scenes that supports this theme",10.0,24 April 2005
There's no halves with Oldboy,"Wow! There's no halves with Oldboy. I haven't seen so many negative reviews for a film so highly regarded by many others. Perhaps its the violence, which is understandable because it can be gratuitous and would make anyone cringe. Major plot holes have been pointed out by others. I would tend to agree with that too. The plot is indeed derivative - the basic Count of Monte Cristo premise has been rehashed before for countless TV shows. Yet despite all these valid criticism's (all of which I agree with), I think Oldboy only falls a notch short of excellent.

The magic is in the execution. The script is quite complex and the editing, camera-work do it full justice. In particular, the entire school sequence and the single-take corridor fight are brilliant.

The plot has Oh Dae-Su, married with one young daughter, kidnapped and imprisoned in a comfortable room for 15 years. When he is released, he does not realise, despite being told that he has merely moved to a larger prison. Hell-bent on revenge, it takes him the rest of the movie to realise that he was better off in prison.

Themes in this movie likely to offend include attempted rape, murder, torture, incest and eating a live baby octopus.",10.0,28 October 2006

Not your typical revenge flick!,"From the moment this movie starts till the end it grips you and takes you into world you don't want to be in but are fascinated with. The trailer is a little misleading because it says he has 5 days to find out who did this to him, although a lot and I do mean a lot takes place before this timer ever begins, so it is not much a race against the clock type of movie that I thought it would be. Instead to quote Kill Bill ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"" and I haven't seen it any colder than in this movie. Makes you look back and say what if that happened to me and that you have to think twice about the things you will say! I'd have to say this movie will cater more to fans of anime since its themes are more like an anime than a Hollywood action movie and that is pricely why I would recommend it. Movies like payback and man on fire are good but Oldboy will make you question after I get my revenge, what next?",10.0,9 May 2005
The best movie I have ever seen,"I wont speak on the plot, or talk about the characters or various scenes. I just got done watching this movie about a half hour ago and I'm in complete awe. this was by far the most original movie I have ever seen. It contains so many different genre themes and yet defies them all and stands as it's own unique work. The acting is top notch I might add.

Don't go into this movie expecting anything at all. Just sit, and watch, and take in the full experience. If you can appreciate an original movie, despite some unpleasant or even disturbing elements, then this movie will likely hit you like a sledgehammer.

For me, this movie will easily be one of those classics in my collection that I value as more than just a movie, and will re-watch many many times for years to come.",10.0,28 August 2005
"Best fight scene ever, excellent filming, excellent music, unique plot.","When I think of the movie Oldboy, I think of a fightscene, a dramatic plot, superb acting, and excellent music.

When sitting down to watch this movie, there are a few things that I advise you to do. Be alone, be in the dark, and have surround sound. This is not a date movie, or a typical action movie... this is a serious film, and a work of art.

There are surprises around ever frame, and there are sequences that will make you gasp with delight, and with horror. If you are reading this, you probably have a taste for movies, so I imagine you won't be disappointed.",10.0,8 September 2005
Strange story - but very entertaining,"When I read some of the negative reviews I began to wonder if I'd just been watching the same movie. But then, I didn't start the movie expecting anything in particular - it always looked intriguing on the trailers and I had a few hours to kill so I got out the DVD. Also, I didn't spend the whole movie trying to second-guess the story and work out the ending before I'd got halfway through - I just sat down and let myself be drawn into Oh Daesu's weird story.

I thought the acting was superb and all the lead characters turned in very convincing performances. The lighting and 'mood' are also perfect. As for the supposedly over the top violence, I really didn't think it was any worse than most Tarantino movies. A fair bit of nasty stuff happens but usually off-camera.

I'd say, if you're a fan of quirky, violent movies with great acting and intriguing story lines - and you don't mind reading fast subtitles then OldBoy could very well be your kind of movie.",10.0,16 September 2005

""Kill Bill"" is another perfect example of a great film with a simple story.

I went into this film with no knowledge of the film or Director and I was blown away by it. The cinematography is excellent, the art direction is amazing, the music is beautiful and the actors are perfect. If you are more into mainstream film then you might not like this but if you are a film buff and know more about movies than the average moviegoer then you will not be disappointed.",10.0,2 September 2005

Unfortunately the popularity of this film tells me just how many such people there are in the world.

Nevertheless, I think it would be a BIG mistake to go for an American remake of this movie, also I would recommend people to watch it with subtitles, the flow of Korean language in certain scenes is important to realise the desperation of the characters there's also the natural innocence and amusement present in all eastern movies. The point of the movie, well, things which for our society are somehow ""tabus"" which can destroy people's lives, I think that is what this movie is about, some kind of eastern-modern version of OedipusRex, but this is only a guess.

I had to special order this baby on DVD because where I live, only ""Great"" films like beauty shop and other crap like that receive fanfare over here. But yeah it was worth it, I have watched it about 8 times and i still cringe every time Mr.Parks teeth get pulled out. The score is also very mellow, but there is a sense that there is more to it. The ending, WOW, I haven't seen an ending like that since Se7en. It really blew me away, i tried to watch it in English and that lasted about a minute. I mean you have to watch it in it's original language in order to grasp the power and ferocity of the actual character of Oh Dae Su and his enemy. I really felt for the guy, he is definitely one of the most developed characters in the past ten years of cinema. Choi Min Sik has a steel gaze, although it may not seem like a lot, that gaze alone you can tell the guy has been through a lot without even hearing his story.

I say that I wish I hadn't watched it because it leaves me with a major dilemma: To tell everyone to watch it, HOWEVER, I'll think each time ""wait...will this person get it?"" and if they don't, ""do I really want to hate them for their opinion?"" While visually wonderful, and technically perfect I found myself most often thinking that the creators succeeded in making it work- for me -by the chances they took. The ant on the subway.

I just lost a few appreciation with the first re-watch .. it was on my top 20 the first time I have seen it but I believe one of the main elements that helped to make it a great masterpiece is the visual effects which will get old and probably in a few years they will look worse & we will start to complain about it.

The plot is very good .. and the script is amazing .. and the performance of Min-sik Choi is one of the best in 2003.

There is so much excitement in this movie .. that is deep and well balanced.

The music is very good and plays in the best time .. completing the nice rhythm of the movie.

It is one of the best movies in 2003 .. and probably the best in 2003 but the problem is that I'm not so sure that it will stand steady facing the time test .. let's re-watch it two years from now and see .. if it is still keeps its good values.",10.0,17 November 2006

If the main actress wasn't so good-looking I would have turned it off :) Maybe the ploy is something special, but I would rather say that is weird and odd. Skills represented by the main characters are worser than in ""Bold and beautiful"", it wasn't even funny. Film is almost 2hours long, and for one hour I was not completely sure what is this all about.

The film itself is not for everyone , but surely it is a modern classic. i hate using words like ""humanity"", and ""journey"", but i think they are appropriate in this sense. through the film, the main character has his humanity stripped from him, and he embarks upon a journey of self discovery that will leave him marked and scarred for the rest of his days.",10.0,25 August 2005

memorable piece of artwork,"Well, as the title says, I think that a good artwork in any platform is not always a pleasant one. To me, what defines any artwork ""good"" is that it has the ability to make us think about issues that we normally wouldn't think or care about.

Oldboy, to me, is one of those works.

No doubt lots of people would find this work distasteful, and I understand why they would think in such fashion, one of the reason been the high level of violence. But then again, since this movie is focused on the theme of ""revenge"", I'd love to see people express about their opinions on that they would do if they had been locked up in a cell alone for 15 years without any apparent reason.

This movie showed me, a unique view, something that one would not see in normal daily life. A view from the mind twisted, hatred filled, yet still passionate man. It is chilling to see how 15 years of isolation can turn a middle-aged middle-class man into.

Chilling.

After watching this movie, it makes me think about how lucky I am that I have a normal, mostly happy life. Compare to the main character, we are all very lucky.

The movie itself handles the character emotions really well. The actors performed both positive and negative emotions flawlessly.

The music is great too, and the tone varies a lot. The last scene combined with the music, gave me a deep impression and after that, a long, deep sigh.

Personally I put Oldboy among the ranks of ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Godfather"", and ""Forest Gump"" as my favorites. Though they all have distinctive themes and different ways of expression, there's one common thing between them.

They all make me think, and think hard.

I certainly hope this film does the same for you.",9.0,4 November 2005
wonderfully awful movie full of genius,"Look there's an awful lot of pompous hot air written about this movie but I fell I have to get the record straight. This is a gleeful, irreverent, hip, mad genre beast of a film. If you like wacky, twisty, Coen Bros like movies full of artifice and inventiveness and sheer irreverence for every moral convention and you're not afraid of an awful large dose of horror this is for you. Of course its silly, and if you must, it might even be offensive but its at least three times better than anything the West is producing. Here is genre film making at its very best (SHEER VISUAL WIT) and its worst (sheer narrative awfulness). Many reviewers have written about its terrible story line but they're missing the point. Of course its a daft storyline, but then again who said Todd Solontzs story lines are wonderful but his films are rich, insane and daft at the same time. At its base its just laugh out loud funny and awful. THere are scenes of true horror and true pathos and scenes of mind bending po-facedness but thats the point. Think what Dario Argentino was doing twenty years back and add in the humour and wit and you have it. Wonderful and of course truly terrible as well.",9.0,9 May 2005
Fantastic,"Others have stated the facts about the movie many times over. And this has been churned over and over, so I'll be brief: The cinematography was excellent. The introduction when Daesu is attempting to escape his prison, while world events play on the right side of the screen really aid in showing the passage of time(Many of the things are Korean related, but things such as the Year 2000 celebrations and the World Trade Center attacks bring it home for others).

The music was good, at times rocking(see above scene).

The plot was also good, well written and maintains a pretty good pace, save a few scenes. The twist ending(as mystery movies always have) was surprising to me, but appreciated. The explanation and conclusion to the story make it worth at least a second viewing.

The Adult Stuff (Sex,violence,language) was really not that bad. All R rated pretty much. Though many say perhaps not enough gore, too much sex(The way most Americans feel about movies and TV) I felt that the fighting scenes were for the most part not about the gore. They were fights, with or without blood. The one torture scene near the start, short lived, provides most of the blood until nearly the very end. The sex, also short lived, seems to cause much more controversy due to it's taboo nature, however any adult could easily tell you it's really nothing(not to mention neither character is aware of the taboo). Nope not explicit, like I said rated R. A high R, but R none the less. There's more sex on television. Language, naturally many expletives at times.

Overall: Fantastic, many great lines, great visuals, and worth at least 2 viewings. If not for the whole movie, at least that wonderful Hallway fight.",10.0,3 November 2006
It has been hyped up to something that it hardly can deliver...,"I remember seeing t his movie back in the day when it was first released, and I remember the movie as being quite good and entertaining. So when I got the chance to sit down and watch it again in 2018, I did so.

Either my taste in movies have changed dramatically over the past 15 years or my memory of the movie have been somewhat deluded. Why? Because this movie was not all that spectacular as I remembered it, nor as the high rating would otherwise indicate.

The movie is unfathomably long, dragging on to the point where it feels redundant. Especially because there isn't a whole lot actually happening in the 2 hours that the movie run for. So it was somewhat of an ordeal to sit through it and not have my attention wander elsewhere.

It was solely the performance of Min-sik Choi that made me stick with the movie to the very end, this second time around. He was phenomenal in the role and was really so well cast for that particular role. But just a shame that he had so very little to work with.

The storyline was mundane and rather stumbling. It took forever to get from A to B, because a whole lot of nothing had to be told and shown on screen in the process of getting there. Which made it feel very prolonged and strained in a way.

I will not be returning to watch ""Oldboy"" (aka ""Oldeuboi"") a third time, that much is for certain.",5.0,29 August 2018
Pleasantly shocking,"Old Boy is the second film in the Revenge Trilogy by Park. The first is Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and the final being Sympathy for Lady Vengeance.

After being imprisoned for 15 years, Ho Dae-su (whose name means ""getting along with everybody"") is released and finds he only has 5 days to find his captor and seek his revenge. Once the captor is found, Dae-su will learn about a past he conveniently forgot and find he is in for an even bigger surprise during the final confrontation.

The film is mesmerizing, hypnotic, and well edited with flashbacks and jump cuts. Park makes an elevator ride feel like a roller coaster. There is a notable fight sequence referred to as the ""one-take corridor scene"" where Dae-su takes several men in mostly hand-to-hand and hammer-to-head combat.

This is a powerful film. It is a meditation on our addiction to TV, the bloody thirst for revenge, and the tomfoolery your mind resorts to when it is forced to relive your memories. The film will make you question the importance of forgetting, forgiving, and the satisfaction, or lack there of, in seeking revenge.

The movie has an incredible build leading up to the finale. The end scene is full of twists. You will be amazed and you watch the truth slowly unravel. You learn that one memory is not as it appears and that another more important memory holding the key to the puzzle was completely forgotten. You will learn that getting the revenge is not the most important thing, but instead be able to live with yourself is. You will find that neither man will be able to do so, which leads to an explosive ending. There is also a bizarre, if not disgusting, love story at the center of this.

Favorite Quote: Too many good ones to mention. It is a tie between ""Be it a grain of sand or a rock  They both sink"" and ""Revenge is good for your health, but Pain will find you again.""

DVD Extras: Commentary, Multiple Deleted Scenes, Interview with director, Still Gallery, and Trailers from Tartan Asia Extreme.

Bottom Line: You will be entranced while following the plot and pleasantly shocked the surprise ending. I will be seeking out Park's other work as well and I suggest you do the same.

Rating: 8.5/10

I didn't like the Catcher in the Rye when I first read it either ...,"Those who are lamenting on how poor a film Oldboy is do not understand some of the fine points that were made in the movie. I thought the Great Gatsby and the Catcher in the Rye were pointless at first, and I had no idea why they were so critically acclaimed. It was not until I realized how applicable those novels were to universal issues (of the era they were written in, but also for future purposes) that I realized the true strength of their messages.

In the same way, I believe Oldboy is more of a thinker's film than a simple revenge film, but that lies in how you interpret the dialogue. It may be that the translations do not carry over very well. But in any case, if you watch Oldboy focusing on just the obvious visceral elements, you will not catch everything. Similar to what Lee Woo-Jin says in the movie, there are reasons why this movie comes out now rather than 15 years ago, but in other ways, it would be meaningful in any era.",8.0,20 February 2005
"The best ""revenge"" movie ever made","This movie is totally awesome!!! That was the feeling I was left with after watching this movie, and I bet that most of people who've watched this movie must have felt the same. The script was so well written, with absolutely brutal tension throughout the movie, plus superb acting make this movie simply spectacular.

The movie begins with an ordinary guy, married with one girl, going sort of crazy in a police station, after night of heavy drinking. After getting out, he makes a phone call to his daughter to tell her that he'll be home soon with her birthday present, then his whole life turns upside down.

He becomes kidnapped by unknown men, held in a solitary room in some building for 15 years, then one day, he was suddenly let out without any kind of explanation. While in captivity, he finds out that his wife's been murdered, and he has became the prime suspect.

After he's been let go, he falls in love with a young woman, and together they solve the mystery behind his capture. When he finally confronts the man that held him for 15 years, he promises him that if he finds out why he was held in 5 days, he'll die for him.

From this point on, the focus of movie shifts from why he was held for exactly 15 years to why he was let go after 15 years. And when the truth becomes finally unveiled, it's so painful and shocking that it makes him wish that he was never let out.

This movie is revenge movie at its best. It will definitely blow away any American revenge or mystery movie you've ever seen, and acting of Choi will leave you breathless, especially the final confrontation between the two men. No one would've thought that director Park would be able to top his previous masterful revenge movie ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance,"" but this movie is even much better, which in itself is unbelievable.

This movie will make you gasping for air. And expect unexpected.",10.0,18 February 2004
"Great, violent comic-like movie.","Funny. This movie has been rated a respectable 8.3 (as January 30, 2006) yet all comments are bad! The problem seems to be that some people can't recognize a comic when the hero does not wear a costume.

Sure, the story is darker than your every day Marvel classic. The final twist quite painful for some of us. And the Hero's morality is more than doubtful.

But some scenes I can't get out of my mind. And the travel thru the darkest passages of hate and revenge is really intense. You have some laughs too. And some good old days punch fighting.

A great movie!",9.0,30 January 2006
A very well made Greek style Korean tragedy.,"This is not a film for puritans, conservatives and anyone who can't see art for what it really is. This is a film obviously inspired by ancient Greek tragedies such as Oresteia or Oedipus tyrannous. The tragic elements and the catharsis are set exactly as in a Greek tragedy. Even the self inflicted punishment is here. This is a real masterpiece in all levels. The acting is just unbelievable, the direction is amongst the best I have seen in the past couple of years. The cinematography is wonderful.

I will not comment on the scenario because as I already said it is based on pieces of literature that have been loved and admired for thousands of years. This movie manages like few others, to induce both sympathy, fear, rage and tears in you. The protagonist is far from a villain. He is merely a victim of a villain and he just wants his life back. It is on my top 300 list.

Whoever didn't get the plot and found it confusing, I guess they watched it without subtitles...",8.0,12 November 2006
Absolutely Awesome,"Anbody considering renting this movie, take my advice and do it. In my 22 years on the planet I don't think I have encountered such an engaging movie which sends the viewer on an emotional roller-coaster. ""With whom do you sympathize? Is this justified?"" are questions that you repeatedly ask yourself from beginning to end.

It brings a new kind of film to the watcher had this film been made in English for the western world with the same crew and cast involved I would put it up as a dead ringer for an Oscar on two. I can not bring myself to say a single bad thing about this movie. Camera angles superb. Lighting picture perfect. THe musical score MIND BLOWING. This is also the type of film I suggest one watches with total concentration as I had to watch it twice and the second time brought with it new revelations that had flown over my head during the first screening as I sat in awe of what I was watching.

This is worth it and I have developed a new respect for the relatively unknown director and will make a point of renting and watching other films he is responsible for. The acting is superb and the action great. Definitely one to own...",10.0,8 May 2006
FREAKIN' AMAZING,"I saw this movie the other day at a film festival, and HOLY ****! This movie is an amazing, stunning piece of work. Incredibly cinematic, beautifully shot, and one of the most intense movies I've ever seen. And not just the obviously intense parts, such as the heavy issues it deals with, but even the fights, which take action and turn it into a piece of art. Check out the one-shot hallway fight for an example. Violent, at times very funny, it never let's go, and it'll take your breath away. Having seen this, most other movies I thought of as ""very good"" have now been reduced to average in the shadow of this behemoth. Check it out and know for yourself.",10.0,14 October 2004
Never such abysmal content has been presented with such brilliant style,"If you've watched a few films off the Saw franchise, you probably know what it is to watch a ""torture porn"" film with a completely ludicrous, ridiculous story, with a style ripped-off from awful MTV videos. Oldboy is exactly like that, with the difference that the style is actually brilliant and gorgeous beyond words. But what's the use of great cinematography, mood and beautiful imagery when its sole point is to deliver a story like this? I have NEVER seen a story so richly pointless, absurd and unrewarding. Yeah, I can deal with films that make ""no sense"", that have ""no meaning"" or things like that; sometimes that's what the director is going for. But the trouble here is that you, as a viewer, is supposed to RELATE to this story, to feel attached to it, as if it could be actually happening. You're intended to connect with the protagonist, or something like that, and that is simply unimaginable. The story is written with the sole purpose of being shocking and disturbing, and that's ALL there is to it. Trust me: the twists and surprises along the way will give you no reward whatsoever, it's just there to shock and disturb you. And if you want to be shocked and disturbed, why not go watch films that address TRULY shocking and disturbing things that are happening around the world, instead of a stupid ""torture porn"" fantasy of a filmmaker? Yeah, Oldboy is not ""torture porn"" in the same strict sense as Saw and Hostel, but in the end, that's pretty much what's going on. And actually, it is doubly so: not only the characters are being tortured, but so is the audience. Ignore the hype and leave this Asiatic garbage aside. No, the beautiful cinematography is NOT worth it.",3.0,11 January 2011
S10 Reviews: Oldboy (2003),"Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) one day on his daughter's 3rd birthday gets picked up for a drunk-and-disorderly charge. When a friend comes to bail him out his life takes a bit of a strange detour that has him kidnapped by anonymous cretins who put him away for 15 years. During his 15 years of captivity Dae-su manages keep track of the outside world through television while the captors do weird things to him. One day he is just set free and he will need to find the answers he needs and the vengeance he craves all while finding the remnants of his shattered life.

This crazy Korean flick has had the scene abuzz for months and after viewing it I see why. 'Oldboy' is a pretty twisted take on a standard ""You done me wrong"" style revenge flick that will keep you engaged and on your toes to the end. 'Oldboy"" is wonderfully shot from its maniacally paced action scenes to the New Zealand landscape in the finale. Min-sik Choi does an amazing job in the lead. He runs practically the whole gamut of human emotion, all in a hyper-convincing matter. You can't help but feel for the guy when he finally gets all the answers and the plot gets uber-evil. A must see for Asian enthusiasts and for exploitation fans alike. The ending is way twisted and one wonders how the American remake will handle it.",8.0,4 September 2005
Simply Outstanding,"Its too bad that most North Americans will not understand this movie. Its not like the pablum that Hollywood likes to feed everyone.

I sat completely glued to my seat watching this movie, wondering what will happen next?

If it wasn't for the ANTI-American(Anti-Dubya?) sentiment at Cannes, this could have easily won the Palme D'Or.

I've really become a big fan of movies coming out of Asia(more so of the horror genre.. not interested in Kung Fu movies), and this has been the best so far.

If the opportunity presents itself for you to see this movie, jump at it, you won't be disappointed.",10.0,17 June 2004
a must see for anyone interested in korean film . . .,"oldboy is a must see for anyone interested in learning more about korean films. the direction of park chan-wook is slightly clumsy, but it matches the pace of the movie. so i'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt when i say that i believe it was fully intentional.

critics argue some of the scenes are too violent or unnecessary, but that misses the point. this movie is solely about revenge, and what we do to achieve it, and the prospect of living life once it has been fulfilled. the violence is simply a collateral matter. and while arguably the violence does force itself into the substance of the movie, mr. park incorporates enough humor to offset the blood.

and the storyline is so twisted, it's almost too unimaginable to be true, which was precisely its draw to me . . .",9.0,1 February 2006
I don't even know why but it worked!,"Calling this movie original doesn't even suffice. It's an unique one really, that takes its own approach with its storytelling and keeps on doing its own thing throughout. It's unlike anything else which also makes it hard to explain why it works out so well all.

It's Asian, so you know that 90% of the time you are going to get something weird. Weird sounds perhaps a bit disrespectful but I mean this is a compliment really, since this often means you're getting something unusual, unexpected, unique and I just absolutely love it most of the time, even when I have no idea what is going on.

And this movie can also get complicated but only when you are not paying full attention to it, or watching it without subtitles perhaps. Fore the story of ""Oldeuboi"" is in essence quite simple and very straight-forward. It's a revenge flick, in which a man searches for the one that held him captive for 15 years. On his search and surrounding his story lots of other stuff is of course happening, that are however often important as clues, as to what is truly going on and what the big reveal at the end will be. It's makes this movie work on a mystery and thriller level, without really following the usual pattern of a mystery or thriller movie. Same goes for all of the other aspects, such as its romance and drama. The movie isn't really black & white with any of its themes and good persons aren't just good and bad persons aren't just evil. This whole approach to its themes of course help to make the movie a surprising one, in which you never really know what you are going to get next.

It's also a movie filled with action and plenty of graphic moments. Many people experience this movie as very disturbing because of that, also since it gets all combined with its unusual and uneasy style and atmosphere. To be honest if have seen far worse things done in films and therefore also never really felt too disturbed by anything in this movie but I guess I'm also not average moviegoer, so my opinion of it isn't very representative for the average viewer.

But I think you can say that the biggest power behind this movie is the directing by Chan-wook Park. It's both technically and visually really a well made film, especially also when you're considering that this movie only cost apparently $3,000,000 to make. Not in anyway does this movie ever look cheap or hastily put together. The movie is made with attention to detail and its filled with plenty of unforgettable, well shot, sequences. So lots of credit also needs to go to Chung-hoon Chung, who did the cinematography and we also really shouldn't forget the musical score by Hyun-jung Shim, who did a more than great job!

But Min-sik Choi performance was just as important for the movie really. He plays a really, complex and divers character, that goes through lots of transitions throughout the movie, though people will mostly see and remember him as an extremely awesome character, that backs down for nothing and nobody. Charlie Bronson would had approved of him! He made Dae-su Oh a real classic film character, at least in certain circles.

Fore ""Oldeuboi"" remains mostly a fan favorite and a bit of a cult classic. a Bit of a shame, since the movie is one that deserves a far broader audience. Just don't let the sort of 'geekdom' that is surrounding this movie scare you off and experience this movie for yourself. Big fat chance you end up really liking it.

I had mixed feelings on this one.,"First off, I'm going to confess to seeing the dubbed version and advise anyone wanting to see this movie to try and see the subtitled version. That version wasn't available to me at the time, and I think I would've liked this movie a lot more if it had been, because as it stands, I wasn't that impressed, and I struggled to get through it all. Which is a shame, because it looked like some of the performances were really good. I don't even know why they dub movies these days. It should be against the law or something. I digress.

This movie is definitely different, and the benefit of foreign films is that you're almost always going to get something stylistically that's a little different from American films. And from that angle, this was an interesting movie. It's also very cringe inducing and not necessarily meant for the squeamish, but the violence is there for a reason and not entirely unjustified, which is good.

The story follows a middle aged guy named Oh-dae-su. Oh-dae-su isn't a bad guy, but he has a knack for trouble and does things like getting drunk and missing his daughter's birthday, so he's not an admirable fellow either, but that's kinda what makes him interesting. Unexpectedly, he gets kidnapped and held prisoner in what looks like a hotel room, except there is an iron door locking him in, and in this room he stays for 15 years until one day he is unexpectedly released. He comes out a changed man, and the rest of the film deals with him seeking revenge on his captors and finding out why he was imprisoned.

I was somewhat disappointed, because in the beginning of the film, I was expecting something along the lines of an introspective look at the human condition, and it turned into more of a regular action thriller with choreographed fight sequences and a diabolical plot that aims pretty close to the heart, but is completely far fetched. And contrary to some reviews I've read on this film, I actually found the ending to be slightly predictable. I just couldn't entirely buy into the story.

Overall it's pretty well directed but at times in-cohesive with scene changes that give little explanation as to where we are or what's even going on. Perhaps it was intentional to allow the viewer to relate more to the main character's bizarre set of circumstances, but the way the shots are assembled, it feels like the movie was either rushed or uncompleted.

And despite good performances all around, some of the casting decisions made no sense to me. For example, one of the major characters is played by an actor who looks about 15 or 20 years too young for his particular role, based on the information we're given about his character. Not a major gripe, but it irritated me throughout the film, and made the movie slightly harder to follow, but not in an intended way.

Again, I know I would've liked it more with subtitles, and I may go back and watch the subtitled version at some point for a re-evaluation, but the movie didn't really leave enough of an impression on me to do it any time soon.",5.0,14 April 2010
a true example of cinema at it's best,"Okay, if you enjoy film at all, in any genre, this movie is exactly what you have been waiting for.It takes a lot for any movie to impress me and this film is so incredibly well made and entertaining that i completely escaped my reality and was enthralled in dae-woo's experience. This script is one of the best i've ever seen, and parks directing is so stylized and so immaculate that it would make Tarantino say""wow i wish i were that good""!The plot line is so intelligent and i don't care who you are you will NEVER see the twist coming. Putting a twist towards the end of a movie is very cliché and overused, but this one is so intelligent, well placed,and well executed it makes fight club look like a Disney film.Speaking of fight, the fight sequences are soooo well done. The famous one shot corridor fight sequence is soooo incredible. THIS is what a fight seen should be.

"""The Definition of Wisdom is that You Can Still Be Shocked""","I'm not really interested in hearing from the people attacking this movie, because it's readily apparent from their comments that they didn't even watch it after the first couple of minutes-- like one who listens to a song without actually hearing it. This is one of two movies I've ever seen people walk out of during a particularly graphic scene-- this is different from someone walking out of a movie because it's out-and-out bad. In a terrible film, people just give up and walk out at any random point (which I've done, too). Something is effective and effectual if you walk out not just because something graphic is happening on screen, but because you emotionally connect with it, and it rattles you. Violence on film, without context, isn't rattling-- it's boring.

""Oldboy"" will rattle you, and I'm sure there's no shortage of reactionary folk who will call it disgusting, offensive, horrid, blah blah blah. Maybe they're right, but it doesn't make this a bad film. You can't look away.

Oh Dae-Su is kidnapped in the film's opening moments, and then held in what looks to be a hotel room (with fortified door and fake window) for fifteen years. This is a 21st Century noir folks, bad things happen. If you're expecting the mainstream violence of a Denzel Washington or Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, stay home. If you're not emotionally involved with this married man, father of a daughter, in the first few minutes, the movie is not for you. It's hard, it's harsh, and though the graphic violence (read: blood) is subdued to keep it in R-territory, it's the psychological power that will grab you by the throat. It's the psychological terror that makes ""The Ring"" (minus the otherworldly) terrifying, and made ""The Blair Witch Project"" so deeply unsettling. Again, if you disagree that those movies were scary, you won't like ""Oldboy."" I can think of no other way to define it.

These are psychologically, emotionally, physically scarred characters. You will travel with them and experience every moment, see things you didn't want to see (not of the blood variety) and learn thing you don't want to learn. If you're ready to go along, then buy a ticket and step inside. If you're not so sure, then I'm sure Denzel Washington will have another movie coming along shortly. Whom I like, but we all know Denzel is going to be okay when the closing credits roll. 10/10, though your mileage may vary.",10.0,23 April 2005
"No, not a masterpiece, but....","While it is true that Old Boy isn't a masterpiece, it is a well-constructed piece of cinema. There isn't anything particularly revolutionary regarding the themes of Old Boy, it is well-acted, beautifully shot, and the characters are engaging.

The movie is both beautiful and sad. Although vengeance is the underlying motivation for our protagonist, the film does not capitalize on a lot of cheap violence. If anything, the film demonstrates the folly of seeking revenge.

Unexpected total involvement,"I have, only recently, become appreciative of Korean films (another fine one is ""Memories of Murder"") and, when I saw a dvd available for ""Oldboy"" and had read of its recent awards, I bought the SE set... The quirky beginning irritated me, but I soon got into the mood of the film and no holds were barred in my total attention to every frame of the movie. It is a masterpiece of directing and editing. Every frame either holds relevance to a previous point of the film or relevance to what will come later on. I was so impressed that I have also purchased the director's previous film, ""Sympathy for Mr Vengeance"" and I look forward to watching that dvd soon.",10.0,1 August 2004
Bitter - Sweet Revenge!!!,"Oldboy is a second film in Parks revenge trilogy, and i personally think that is the best one. Also for me it is the best Korean film i saw, and trust me i love Korean cinema. An excellent story directed with a lot of creativity,and visual beauty, chains the viewer to the screen until the end. Great atmosphere supported by excellent music and very good performance from the actors makes this film very interesting to watch. The use of color is also very good.

I watched this film many times, and i advise you to watch it at least twice, cause first time watching, you may find it confusing.

I was reading latest posts from people who watched it, and i get upset with people rating it low, but the final score talks for itself!

Oldboy is an amazing experience, but not suitable for everyone. This days people tend to like crap for the masses, and forget about being original and creative.

Do I Deserve to Live?,"Director: Park Chan Wook Duration: 120 minutes

Some films just do not allow themselves to fall into generalizations and these films pose conundrums when one tries to explain them. I've owned _Old Boy_ for a number of months now, but for some reason or another I had been able to make myself sit down and watch the film. For some reason I thought it was a horror film and being that I generally do not care for horror films I let this one sit on the sidelines while I watched other films. However, I was finally inspired to watch this film when my Korean office partner told me how much she enjoyed the film, been amazed by Choi Min Sik's acting, and how long the film stuck in her head after watching it. Trusting my friend's taste in film, last night I finally settled down to watch the film and similar to my reaction with other films that I had underestimated, I wondered: Why the heck had I had not watched this film earlier?

The film begins with a drunken Oh Daesu, Choi Min Sik, sitting in the police office. He is a noisy drunk heaping abuse on the police officers and constantly trying to urinate on the floor. He tells the police to let him go because it is his daughter' birthday, but when his pleas fall on death ears, he becomes even more recalcitrant to remain calm in the police office. Eventually Daesu's friend comes to pick up his inebriated friend. However, while talking to Daesu's daughter on the phone, the friend notices that Daesu is missing.

Daesu finds himself imprisoned in a room that resembles a cheap motel room. Fed a diet of dumplings and with a television as his only companion, Daesu will live for fifteen years inside of that small room. Occupying his time watching television, punching the walls, writing the names of all who might have had him imprisoned in that room, watching television, and carving a hole in the wall with a metal chopstick, Daesu grows older his youth withered away within that room. However, one day, he finds himself on top of a building finally free to hunt the individual who had imprisoned him. Daesu eventually makes a new friend in the personage of the young sushi chef Mido, Gang Hye Jeong, who for some reason seems to fall for Daesu as he consumes a live squid, who accompanies him on his search for the individual who ruined his life.

This is an extraordinary film. Choi Min Sik's acting is top notch and one can really feel his anger and frustration inside of his prison. I won't go into details here, but his performance during the final minutes of the film must be witnessed to be believed. The music is grand and the special effects are nicely done. The ant poking through Daesu's skin is creepy as hell.",10.0,23 April 2005
Asian Cinema out-matching Hollywood,"I'm totally new to watching movies with subtitles. I've been a movie fan for over 10 years, and if i run through the top 100 list on the site, I'm certain I've seen 99% of the movies on there, sad but true.

But much to my surprise, OLDBOY, my first ever Asian movie, was a tickle on the feet. Though I've read some of the remarks on this site regarding this movie, i think many of them are nonsense, a lack of appreciation for superb acting, great screen play, a story line that actually works with the characters, and a plot which was successfully unravelled within the 2 hour mark.

Many people write off movies like these based on 2 notions, one is HIGH EXPECTATION TO ONES PERSONAL LIKING and the other, DISAPPOINTMENT DUE TO LACK OF FICTIONAL ERA IN MOVIES. Oldboy, is a realistical production, which outlines emotions, hate, vengeance and love with all fairness and much to my liking an excellent SCRIPT.

What an annoying little pretentious slop of a movie. If it's any indication, Quentin Tarantino worships it. That alone should send up some warning flags (that fruitcake should go back to his decapitated Barbie dolls).

I feel sorry for the 4 squids that were killed in the making of this movie (shoved into some guy's mouth and eaten alive & thrashing about). For what? So that some punk boys in the audience can say, ""Yuck! Coooool!"" It's a sad day for the human race when this is a celebrated form of entertainment.

Btw, the star of the movie, supposedly a devout Buddhist, excused his actions by saying he prayed for each squid after he chewed it up alive. How sweet.

Aside from that, the movie is about as juvenile as one of my 4th grade crayon sketches. I guess that's why this film is popular with 4th graders. (Does your mommy know you're sneaking out to watch R-rated films?) I'm appalled at how many internet kids love this movie. But then again, a lot of Romans loved the gladiatorial games. If you're one of these people, go ahead; ignore this review and go back to slurping your raw meat & watching porn. You're just one of the (internet) masses.",1.0,18 July 2007
Unexpected total involvement,"I have, only recently, become appreciative of Korean films (another fine one is ""Memories of Murder"") and, when I saw a dvd available for ""Oldboy"" and had read of its recent awards, I bought the SE set... The quirky beginning irritated me, but I soon got into the mood of the film and no holds were barred in my total attention to every frame of the movie. It is a masterpiece of directing and editing. Every frame either holds relevance to a previous point of the film or relevance to what will come later on. I was so impressed that I have also purchased the director's presvious film, ""Sympathy for Mr Vengeance"" and I look forward to watching that dvd soon.",10.0,1 August 2004

In Response To...,"I'm writing this comment in response to another comment by an IMDb user. I've watched a fair number of movies in my time with a wide range of genres... I'll have to say that although this movie does have some details that may irk some, as a revenge film it is outstanding.

While the aforementioned comment was made in a similar fashion as the ""overpraisers,"" (overpraisers, under-praisers they're all the same, LOL) he fails to recognize some of the important elements that he/she perhaps lost in translation. The story of Oldboy has many elements that only eastern viewers may understand, or a more rounded out western viewer. For example, Oh Dae-su's name is very important to the movie, if you've missed this, watch it again. There are small bits and pieces in this film that many viewers will fail to understand because the movie has that subtle layer below the obvious that the aforementioned user ""saw."" The movie's ending is also quite intriguing. While many will see the ending very simply and only skim the surface of the reality presented to them, there is an argument that the director has presented to the viewers that needs careful attention, examination and discussion.

It is difficult for a western audience to truly appreciate this movie, or Park's Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance. While many will dub either of these movies as ""gorefests,"" Park is presenting the bare and raw version of revenge that humans often desire. He shows us the limits to which many are willing to go for attaining said vengeance. If you don't believe people like this exist, simply browse through a paper.

If you watch this movie, watch it with an open mind. AND PLEASE, please, please, dive deeper into the surface of the movie, question everything you see and discuss the movie. Don't just say it's ""extreme"" cinema or that it's a ""gorefest."" Most of all, don't rely on the opinion of others to sway your decision to watch this movie. Watch it, if you don't like it, turn it off and save yourself the displeasure of sitting through it.",9.0,7 June 2006
Memorable,"I just rented this film and it really is pretty good. Good enough to register (despite having to fire up IE) specifically to disagree with the headline ""User Comment"" for this film. The plot jumps about and has a drunk camera man (which seems to be all the rage these days) but the overall impression is pretty good. You can watch 99% of mainstream films and turn off half way but still be able to describe the entire film in pretty good detail. OldBoy has unexpected plot twists / memorable imagery / unpleasant imagery / flawed main characters and is in all ways better than any standard blockbuster.

General summary - I liked it and it will stick in my memory for some time. Well worth watching.",8.0,6 April 2006

a great B-movie,"Seeing so many comments on Oldboy,I find it difficult to comment on it. I personally like the film.Everything is magnificent--the directing,the acting,the music... I admit that I felt confused and uncomfortable the first time I saw the film.But it got better and better and now I can enjoy it over and over.It's just like Fight Club or Muholland Dr.The perfect directing of the film will make everything unbelievable believable.I know why some people hate the film.It's just suit for those who like violence but don't have a history of violence. Oldboy will set their pressure free.The attitude toward this film should be like this:if you love it,rate it for 10;if you hate it,rate it for 1. There's no middle area.Even though the film has many weak points,I think it's still better than some blockbusters that when you're watching it,you think it's spectacular,but when you rate it, you just give it a 6 or 7.

See it again,maybe this time you'll be hypnotized by Chan-wook park.",10.0,5 June 2005
Hard to endure this.,"Undoubtedly cleverly construed film. I finally got to see this film as the film The Handmaiden of the same director is one of my favourite films of the last 2 decades. And I will be seeing his new film Decision To Leave very soon. I have to say I don't get all the rave reviews for this film. The film is a bit of a puzzle to me. It is brilliantly shot with some very special filmed scenes and sequences and I read later it is based on a manga cartoon. That explains a lot, I guess. The film has 2 primary colours you will see throughout the film: green and red, for obvious reasons, but I won't be giving any spoilers. I was really appalled by the grotesque and over the top violence and really incredibly stupid fighting scenes (manga). I am sure the violence must have brought a smile on the mouthwatering face of Quentin Tarantino, but it is just sick to watch. Understanding the film in 1 view is impossible (but I for myself would never watch a film like this twice), so I read some stuff afterwards. That did not make my decision for this film to be more positive, au contraire. As I found it very pretentious, indeed. 2 characters who were in school together and one hardly aged at all a few decades later, that was a flaw. 2 Hours this film is. Be warned: that's 120 minutes! Watch the Handmaiden instead.",4.0,9 September 2022

Amazing Film From An Amazing Director,,10.0,2 August 2005
No way of forgetting this stunning product of genius film making,"From the very start, this film won't leave you with a single dull moment; every actor convinces, every scene is there where it has to be, every character can at least claim something of our sympathy and antipathy, in short, it is the perfect Greek tragedy. By that, I mean for example that the main character is not only vulgar and blunt, but he's also funny and likable. His enemy seems to be cold and repulsive, but then even he turns out to have his own reasons for what he's doing. The end is more than shocking, without being cheap (don't tell anyone in advance). Colours, photography, direction, timing, it's all flawless, as far as I can judge. I was wondering whether I was drunk or something when I saw it in the cinema, because I was so impressed, but I wasn't! I would really like everyone to see it. For those who haven't seen any good Korean films yet and still think that because it's Korean, it can't be absolutely great, well, sorry guys, but I don't know if any western filmmaker could beat Old Boy in the next ten or so years!",10.0,15 May 2005
"Brilliant, twisted, revenge thriller.","Oldboy is quite simply the greatest movie I have ever seen. I am not overrating this. In my opinion, words cannot begin to describe the feelings this movie left me with. I was left totally speechless while I contemplated this masterpiece.

From the opening shot, director Chan Wook Parks's intelligent use of camera angles is a joy to behold. He instantly adds a grittiness to the story with the use of his camera work, which in places can be extremely subtle. The soundtrack to this movie is the perfect accompaniment to what is unfolding on screen. It grabs you by the ears and slams you head first into the story line. Brilliant.

Min Sik Choi is excellent in this movie. I can honestly say that in places his acting ability and the depth of character he creates can be quite disturbing. The end scene in particular. The character Dae Su Oh is an interesting one, and the journey he is forced to undertake is quite simply, brutal. I feel that although the story line can be conceived as far fetched, it makes compelling viewing, and at no point during this film did I think it was in any way ridiculous. It is testament to the director's ability and that of the actors involved, that this awesome movie has been such a success both in Asia and more recently Western markets.

Although this movie will not be to everyones taste, I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is quite simply wonderful.",9.0,6 March 2005
Excellent movie,"This is the 1st Korean movie that I've ever seen, & I think it's excellent ( I already saw a lot of Japanese & Chinese movies ) . After that I saw Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance, Painted Fire & A Tale Of Two Sisters. I found them all quite good but Oldboy remains my most favorite South Korean movie. Of course I read the review in the newspaper but by the time I sat down & watched Oldboy, I already forgot what it's all about so I was able to watch it without any preconceived notion. I find it fascinating that even though it's a crime drama, the movie offers a look into the South Korean society where people live with such passion. I know the story originates from Japanese materials but it does not really affect much the art of film-making.",8.0,4 November 2006
all the ingredients of a Greek tragedy,"I am not a man of profound words and like to say things as i see them.Korea is not the first place that comes to mind when thinking hard edge or originality. but that may just be my lack of Korean viewing.

This film has a pace that some may feel is slow, however i felt that it steadily gave you that little bit more and a little bit more that kept you wanting.....a little bit more.

This film is dark and edgy, it does not offer any grand wire work or scenic views to ponder over.

If only Hollywood could see past the money and box office then maybe we would see more stories of such shocking humour and at times shivering ugliness. My comments are i am afraid a mystery, just see this film and you'll see why i give nothing away.",9.0,4 November 2004

"Boring, overrated",,2.0,29 June 2021
Best movie out of Korea--ever.,"Old Boy prays on things that South Koreans hold VERY dear--family, honor, and personal freedoms. The 15 year imprisonment is an affront to the personal freedoms, and the family and honor part is apparent (I don't want to give it away). In order to TRULY appreciate it, you must understand the deep seeded nature of these values. To give this movie an overall classification, I would say Quentin Tarantino meets your favorite mind game/mystery. The movie is, however, GREAT on many more levels. For example the torturous nature of the incarceration is brilliantly portrayed; you truly feel for the character. The element of mystery is unpredictable (especially for American audiences) with reveals coming at just the right time. There is also a scene in which our hero mows down about 40 henchmen in a narrow hallway. It is filmed in ONE SHOT. The only reason this film did not win overall best at Cannes Film Festival is because Farenhight911 was the political favorite in France. Overall it is worth reading the subtitles, even if you are not a foreign film fan.",8.0,9 March 2005
Old Boy,"So many people, so many visions. When I heard Oldboy was said to be one of the best movies of 2004, I was curious. It is always difficult for a movie that blasts some taboos into the theater's to hold on outside of them. Until half the movie I would give it a 7.5, but the final chapter of it makes the jigsaw complete and the it is a 8.5. Then I came to see here, and 8.5 it was as an average of about 8000 viewers. I think I saw around 100 movies, new and old, only this year. And matching old boy to only them, it is a great movie. A movie isn't only great in acting or writing, it is the total concept that takes u. (or not) It is a true vengeance story with, for me, slices of Seven, Kill Bill, other asiamania movies, big brother. An example of a vengeance movie: Abril Despedaçado (Behind the sun) has a 7.6 on 1000 hits and lots of people are going to find this a better movie, but it is a complete different atmosphere and u know what's coming and Oldboy takes u the hardest on the end and that's what people remember most.",9.0,24 April 2005

"Magnificent, one of my favourite Asian films.","Oldboy just blew me away. A month earlier I had seen Seven Samurai and Spirited Away, which are both great films, but Oldboy topped them both in my opinion. I can understand why a lot of people might not like this, but for me it was just everything a great film should be, a good plot, well paced, well acted and with a great soundtrack as well. It was a film which I watched again the day after I saw it for the first time, it had that impression on me.

The premise seemed intriguing, a man is kidnapped for what seems to be no reason and is locked away for 15 years. Then he's released and has to find out what the reason was for his kidnapping. When I saw this plot outline and that it was listed in the top 100 here in the IMDb, I was eager to check it out. In a sense, I got the wrong idea about it, I thought it would be very violent and gory like other Asian Extreme films, and I had heard many people criticising this film for just being out to shock with its violence. I don't really understand this, I winced when a close-up was shown of a person's tooth being pulled out, and it is a violent film, but from what I'd heard I was expecting a lot more violence and I don't see why people make such a big deal out of it.

There are many memorable scenes in this film, an infamous one-take corridor fight is one of them, as the main character Dae-Su Oh takes on a bunch of guys with a hammer. I mentioned how the film is well-paced, and it is, Dae-Su is taken out of the blue, some time is given to showing the conditions he is locked up in, and then he's released, finding out small parts of information that eventually build to this awesome climax. Many climaxes feel rushed, but the two hour film makes sure the whole last half hour is taken up by its climax, meaning it rounds it all off well, and it's one of the best endings I've seen.

Every scene is acted well by Min-Sik Choi, who is good all the way through but really shows off his acting talents in the climax where he's just magnificent. However, Ji-tae Yu is often overlooked and he's also excellent in this, his character is a very 3-dimensional villain with different emotions. Ji-tae Yu is creepy when he needs to be creepy, but also allows us to feel sympathy for his character in places. The villain is really what makes this film work, he isn't just a 2D character thrown in to make it a bit more difficult for the hero, he's just as interesting and integral to the story as Dae-Su himself.

The score by Yeong-Wook Jo is also a crucial part of the film, for me it's one of the best of this decade so far. The music is always there, always fitting the mood of what is happening on screen, but it's in the last half hour when it becomes amazingly memorable. The music playing at the ending and over the credits is brilliant, and there's one scene in particular where the music combined with the scene is so memorable that it now sends shivers up my spine whenever I hear the music now.

I thought this film lived up to all the hype and I think it deserves its place in the IMDb's top 100, everything about it is above average. It's well made and very entertaining, make sure you see it before anybody spoils it for you.",9.0,2 October 2005
"""Brilliant Performance and Direction""","Old Boy Dae-Su Oh gets imprisoned for 15 years not knowing why, every so often music will play and gas will enter the room, knocking him out. Every time he awakens hair cut, shaved and the room have been cleaned. Upon his release he has 5 days to find out why in the first place and by whom his captors were.

This is the second film by Park in series of revenge films. After seeing this film, I am very eager to view Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and the upcoming third installment. Park shows his talent in this film as he shows us a beautifully choreographed corridor fight scene, with no cuts. The camera simply pans back and forth through the action and the fights scenes aren't those one guy takes on ten with high flying action, it's real, it's grounded and he still takes on ten guys.

Min-sik Choi gives one of the best performances I've seen in awhile and the bad guy, although not as dynamic as Choi, holds up well as well. The other supporting cast are able to portray real emotions and make the whole movie work and come all together in the performances. In the climax of the film, Choi gives not only a brilliant performance, but a weird one, that will have you either in tears of sorrow, or laughter. It's great seeing him try to adapt to the world, after being imprisoned for 15 years, like what he would do if he were to see a woman.

The film is violent, not in a killing way, because most of the deaths are taken place off-screen. The violence comes from torture scenes, you know, where a guy takes a hammer and takes out the guys teeth...ouch. There is a plot twist, and it is a big one. I was shocked and it stuck with me for ten or so minutes, the twist is controversial, which may put off a lot of American audiences, but I believe it makes the film what it is.

You feel sorrow for the main character, and even the bad guy, but can't really grasp this emotion until the climax of the film, a little late if you ask me, but the emotion that that scene brings out is in top form. It's a scene that goes down in history as disturbing, heart-wrenching, violent, suspenseful, funny, shocking...all in one.

So what can I say about this film, well, it's one to watch, maybe more then once, because it could be difficult for some to grasp at first, or even if you do, may be hard to actually ""believe"". Aside from that, this film is a treat for the eyes as one of the best revenge films to grace the screen.",9.0,14 September 2005

I will surely watch it again. And maybe again. Anyone with true love for films and with a heart will appreciate films from this country and among many, Oldboy the most. It is so powerful, it leaves you completely speechless, it makes you wanna go back to it, loving it or hating it, for what it is and what it shows. The humanity, oh so incredible.

The cinematography is also amazing. It's a beautifully shot movie, which is a welcome surprise for the action genre. The plot is interesting, thought provoking, and fairly believable. There's no flying in the air or other supernatural elements. For the most part, it sticks to the real world for the action scenes.

Fans of Miike, Trier, and Raimi should thoroughly enjoy this film. It's twisted, humorous, unsettling, and if you're like me, you won't want to take your eyes off it.",9.0,27 September 2005
A good movie with a silent build up to an amazing ending.,"To appreciate this movie you need to pay attention and try to figure out the characters. Otherwise it'll fall flat and you'll be left with a glib, shallow misunderstanding, missing the real value of the movie. This would be unfortunate, as it's a good movie with a silent build up to an amazing ending. It's one gritty, dark, and lurid revenge flick worth watching if for nothing else but the, ""GaaoooOOOO!"" inducing ending.

Minor Plot Details: The basic idea of it is that a man is inexplicably imprisoned in reasonably comfortable quarters of a private prison, with TV as his only companion, and fried dumplings his only meal. After 15 years he unexpectedly wakes up one day on a grassy roof, freed. A relatively short time thereafter he is handed one cell phone and a wallet full of cash. From here things develop into a story of abject revenge and vengeance, with a conclusion that'll leave you realizing how well made this movie actually is. It's one hell of a revenge flick.",9.0,4 January 2006

We see other piece of crap foreign films like Flying dagger or Hero(which wasn't so bad but not as good as old boy) to be premiered coast to coast. And not only old boy, we see other good Korean films like Taegukki AKA bortherhood of the war and Shiri to be ONLY released in certain state or theater.

This film was NOT predictable at all!,"This is the first film by Chan-wook Park that we have seen.. I must say that the plot was so well developed. There was no moments where I felt like I could see through the plot. It worked on so many levels, even the ending was great! The only reason this film did not receive a ten, is that I just saw it and haven't given it a chance to set in. Most films we see do not become instant classics, even if they're great. This film has beautiful women, flash, amazing cinematography, and great dialogue. The violence is also elegant and artistic. It is even possible to watch the dubbed version because the narrative voice is enjoyable and the translation seems legitimate. It's best to let it sink in. It will definitely be added to the collection.

Just the way I like it,"Wait! Hold down to your criticism. I am now commenting on this movie from an Asian's point of view! I watched a lot of Asian movies, and so this movie isn't as bad and twisted as other viewers commented in my opinions. The plot... I know it is kinda shaky and no-brainer at the end... but the main characters' sorrow and consequences of his doing fall at the right place with one another.

Some users comment that ""Internal Affair"" is another bad movie from Asia. Shut your mouth! Asian movies aren't just about konfu fighting and martial art. If you are hoping for some serious fighting and ridiculous moves, just go to your closest Blockbuster and rent a Jacky Chen movie, then practice those stupid moves with whomever you wanna fight with. This is not the genre of the movies you will enjoy.

Another point that I want to make is this movie is based on the plot of a comic book. Therefore, do not expect that the story plot will be 100% logical. If you ever watch the movie ""Sin City,"" then you will appreciate much more how the director has made this movie much more understandable for the viewers. You don't trust me?

"""Even though I'm no more than a monster - don't I, too, have the right to live? "" - Oh Dae Su","It's rare that I see a movie I'm so excited about, that I watch it again the day after I've first viewed it. 'Oldboy' is one of the rare movies, a hyper-active energetic gore-fest with Tarantino undertones from South Korean filmmaker Chan-Wook Park. The film surrounds a thirty-something year-old businessman Oh-Dae Su (Min-Sik Choi) who pretty much gets wasted every night after work. One night he is kidnapped by mysterious captors and help prisoner in a window-less room that looks like a hotel room. He has now inter-action with anyone for 15 years inside there, so he starts to make a list of all the people he's ticked off in the last decade or so. One day he wakes up in an extra-large suitcase on top of an apartment building roof. From there he goes on a mission to find his long-lost daughter and to find whoever did this to him and exact revenge (a.k.a. = he's going to kill their ass!) Along the way, he befriends and falls in love with a young female sushi chef, Mi-Do (Hye-jeong Kang) who helps him on his journey. The feature also stars Ji-Tae Yu, Dae-Han Ji, Dal-Sul Oh, Byeong-OK Kim, Seung-Shin Lee and Jin-Seo Yun. Chan-Wook Park's directing is stellar to say the least while the acting is top-notch 100%. Min-Sik Choi gives a riveting performance as our hero, while Hye-jeong Kang does alright with her role. Dae-Han Ji and Dal-Sul Oh provide much needed humor for this crime-mystery while Ji-Tae Yu creates one of the most effective villains in recent years. 'Oldboy' isn't a film for everyone and if you don't have the stomach for it make sure you avoid it. But, for those with the same flair and passion for great cinema as me, I would definitely encourage you to give it a whirl. 'Oldboy' has very few flaws and a lot to love about it.

See this one for yourself,"First time when I heard the title, because I read the original comic 'old boy' it was not new for me. Ironically, i found out that if you care about originality in terms of technical work, re-engineered plot etc, this one is definitely the one for you. Very weird/ very unique for the eyes trained for Hollywood movies. If you are after matrix type of movie, this one's not for you. If you have an average tolerance and ability to read the subtitle( again not for blockbuster lovers, because even if this were to be a big screen movie, you won't have time to keep your eyes focused on the screen and enjoy the beautiful explosion scene,,,the whole time you will be complaining like a little girl doing a cha-cha), from my experience, there were some people who just hated movies because there was subtitle-i couldn't concentrate while watching 'the last samurai' because those high school American guys were keep asking his friend, 'what was that just before?... what did he just say?' Otherwise, not a bad one for you!",10.0,19 October 2004
"The most unintellectual, mind numbingly boring film you could feast your eyes on...","Frankly I can't understand the rating of this film on IMDb. Eight point something - oh puh-lease. Yes, I wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this utter tripe, in some vain, and hoping for some redemption - however, as the film went on, and with every minute longer that I watched it, as opposed to having reached for the power button, as much as I sensed disappointment looming 10 minutes through, the disappointment continued without abatement until the very end. So my advice to you is, watch it, I don't care if you ignore this warning/review! but should you, 15 minutes through start having reservations - act upon them and save yourself some time.

The worst thing about a film that you've got to watch with subtitles, is, you have to stay focused intently else you might miss something. On the plus side, it means I am able to present to you, my opinion, that you can rest assured is something formed from a full and proper, intense session, of a waste of 2 hours of my life! Not through laziness, but just because this film is so simple in storyline, - there isn't much depth to it and hence I don't really think this film deserves much more time spent on it pondering the rubbish storyline which is very thin on the ground.

Suffice to say, the premise of the entire film is a joke. It's fantasy land viewing with scenes that are too far fetched. Even if the scenes were believable - the motivations of protagonist are not. Of the far fetched scenes, all were mediocre, leaning towards downright laughable and boring.

This film has been over-rated by a bunch of namby pamby wannabe critics without a clue. People who see something from nothing. A joke. I could sum up the entire premise of this film in one paragraph, and the film makers have padded it out to a 2 hour film. There are two times when the majority of people write reviews, when they really like a film, or and more often, when they really despise it. This film falls into the latter category, because there are people out there who believe this is a masterclass and have almost coerced people like me into wasting 2 hours of my life to watch this - so here I am, offering balance. Watch to your detriment - this film is for simple minds, and reviewing this in 2013, and decades down the line, people will look upon this film with contempt, the same way I have. My two cents!",1.0,16 March 2013
"It's not about revenge, it's about meaning and life","There are movies that aim to entertain, and there are movies that attempt to say something. This movie aimed to do both, and succeeded admirably. Sure, upon reflection, various parts of the plot don't seem to follow from one another, and so many things in the movie are implausible. But does one want a movie that is as smooth and plausible as yesterday afternoon? Like it or not, human life is tortured and zigzags without warning. What matters is making sense of it afterwards in a way of one's choosing.

This movie is not really about revenge. It is about the human need for knowing things not just about oneself, but about other people. The protagonist could never have lived with himself without knowing why certain things happened to him. Our lives make no sense when the intentions of others are ignored.

Most touching in the movie was the woman's sacrifice for the protagonist and his for her. They were entirely dedicated to each other, and showed that one being willing to do anything to make another happy alone induces happiness.

Thus, the movie invites the viewer to contemplate his need not only for narrative meaning in his life, but also for the intersubjective quality of that meaning.",9.0,27 August 2005

Very enjoyable thriller,"Very nicely done with neat twists and turns in the plot ! Visual effects were pretty well done.

Very well acted and paced.

One gripe was the main character gets a bit overly melodramatic at times throughout the movie, but I think this is a form of Korean machismo, and I've definitely seen this type of Korean machismo firsthand. So I guess it's true to life.

This movie reminds me of the mathematical object -- the Mobius strip. Watch the movie and I think you'll understand what I mean.

I think one fight scene should have been reworked by the director to make it more believable (the one involving the hammer).

The last scene -- I didn't see it coming, but it fit the movie perfectly.",9.0,14 September 2005
A well done film. Better than 90% of what is out there today.,"I will make this brief.

A lot of people have come on here to talk about how this movie DOESN'T live up to the hype.

In my opinion, the hype was just right. IMDb gives this around an 8.5 and that is about what I would give it. It's an incredible well done and stylish movie. Is it GROUNDBREAKING? Well. Yeah. It kinda is... in a few ways.

I am not going to write a long review. Sufficed to say.... if you have a brain in your head, you will appreciate this movie on some level. It IS violent and tasteless in some ways... but... really nothing that new or brutal. I was actually surprised at the low level of violence in this movie (after reading all these negative reviews about violence for the sake of violence). I felt every moment of violence in this film was justified. If I went through what HE did... I would be just as violent.

Anyway. Thats all I have to say. If you are grappling with the decision to rent this... here is all I can say: If you play a lot of Skateboarding video games and like Adam Sandler.... or if your idea of a good horror movie is ""Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte"",... then you should probably skip this one. If you are a fan of original, innovative film making and you don't mind a little of the old ""ultraviolence"", then try this one on for size.

I (personally) cannot wait to see the rest in the series.

Twisted and unusual; A film that will stay fresh in your mind for a long time.,"Oldboy is unique from plot to soundtrack; delving into depths western cinema would not even dream of going. It requires your undivided attention throughout as it questions human moralities and how far one will go to seek vengeance and keep secrets under wraps. The plot twist Oldboy hands to the viewer is frighteningly well executed, leaving you blind as it hits you like a tonne of bricks. With twists and turns like this, Oldboy will drop jaws and leave you tearing up with its clever ending.

However, Oldboy will leave a bit of a strange taste in your mouth at times and leave you neither liking nor disliking any of its characters. Its plot does rely on a few coincidental actions. For example, how did Oh Dae-su just so happen to stumble upon Mido's restaurant? This and a small amount of other scenes in the film could have been explained a bit better. Whilst Oldboys fight scenes are arguably sparse and cheap-looking, they are used to the right effect and are frequent enough to keep you glued to the screen throughout. They will, however, leave some viewers with the desire for more scenes similar to the hallway fight scene, which is filmed brilliantly and thoroughly enjoyable but not as convincingly as they'd like to think.

Despite this, these flaws are drowned out as Oldboy still manages to deliver enough evidence to strongly support the plot, leaving you thinking ""how, why and really?"" rather than ""this makes no sense"" and this is exactly what it wants you to do. For you to ask questions of yourself and the people around you. That's the beauty of the film and what it performs so well, never before have I seen a film that has left me drawn back, a film that is so twisted that I have questioned the conclusion I have come to. For these reasons Oldboy is a must watch, an incredible piece of cinematic and directorial genius which Chan-wook Park should be proud of and renowned for. Oldboy will stay on your mind for a long time, accompanied by its memorable quotes.

An Excellent Korean Masterpiece,"This is the best Revenge/Thriller movie I have ever seen. I watched in in 2014 after many of my friends recommended this movie to me.

*****NO SPOILERS , JUST READ IT FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF PLOT****

I read the plot on IMDb and it looked interesting. A man (protagonist) who is a drunkard is captured by police. His friend comes and gets him out of the jail. It is protagonist's daughter birthday and he is completely drunk. His friend makes a call to home from a public booth and after that he finds that the protagonist has disappeared.

Now we find that someone has kidnapped him and he does not know why. He finds himself in a room. He passes him time by watching TV where comes to know that his wife is dead and daughter is missing. Police are thinking that he killed his wife and ran away. So he is wanted. He is wondering why somebody has kidnapped him? He learns how to fight by watching TV programmes for 15 years. He thinks that once he gets out of this place, he will kill the person responsible for his kidnapping. 15 years pass and suddenly he is released.

Now he has to find out what happened and why he was captured. He has only 5 days to find out.

Sounds Interesting. doesn't it? Now go and watch the movie and you will be blown away. At first I thought its not a reason to do such thing to a person but the last third of the movie is spectacular when everything becomes clear. When you come to know what exactly happened and why?

Highly Impressed,"Something different. Something new. I'm impressed with the story. This was one of those movies that made me say ""Damn, Fo real! That's F'ed up"". I enjoyed it and would recommend it. I like the story of it better than the movie itself if that makes sense. Some reviewers don't like the fact that it's voice overs rather than subtitles but I'm fine with that. Some people with short attention spans or who can't comprehend longer developing movies might not understand what's happening. I had to explain what happened to my mother. An American version/remake would/will be awesome. There are a few minor things I would have changed had I been involved with the movie, but hey who am I. This is one of those movies that sticks in your head long after watching. To sum it up the movie was cool.",9.0,8 September 2012

brilliant!,"Please don't watch this movie with the English over-dubbed. It ruins the acting of the original actors.

That said this movie is a masterpiece. I was looking for movies like Momento, The Usual Suspects, Inception, Primer, etc that had interesting plot twists and premises and this happened to be on a list. I didn't much care for the description on the back of the movie but Ebert giving it 4 stars convinced me to watch it.

The acting, especially by the main character, is astoundingly good. Thankfully the script is equally intriguing and, as the pieces start to fall into place, yields some ""ah-ha"" moments to the baffling premise.

This movie warrants re-watching. Some of the subject matter is a little more extreme then normally what Hollywood would allow (though not in terms of gore). Its definitely not a good date movie. I would recommend watching it when you are alone or with friends and in an open-minded and patient frame of mind willing to put a little effort into the viewing experience. If you are just looking for some quick entertainment, laughs, or something you don't have to pay complete attention to save this for later. There is actually quite a bit of funny stuff in here but is very much dark comedy material.",10.0,11 July 2012
Stylish human suffering,"Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) has spent fifteen years imprisoned within a highly guarded motel room. He doesn't know where he is, why he has been imprisoned, or even by whom. All he has are dumplings to eat, television to watch and nothing but time to spend. And suddenly, one day, he gets released and told that he has a short amount of time to figure out why he lost fifteen years of his life.

From that intriguing setting we end up getting one of the best thrillers ever made. Directed by South Korean Chan-wook Park, Oldeuboi is perhaps the best film he has made to date. And this film truly shines because of its director. The story, based on a manga series of the same name, is iron tight and translated to the silverscreen very well. Park utilizes camera angles, lighting and colours with a master's hand and the film looks phenomenal. Long shots without cuts are used when needed, the whole film has a very stylish neo-noir look to it and it's also paced so that you're always held at the edge of your seat. It provides just enough information to keep you satisfied, but it's only at the end when all is revealed, and that ending twist is perhaps the best I've ever witnessed. Horrifying, sick and yet logical all at the same time.

Min-sik Choi is also a very strong leading actor. He ranges from pathetic white collar loser to a hardened avenger without never missing a beat. It's also a very physical role to pull off, as he has to go from an overweight office worker to a man who has spent fifteen years with nothing else to do but work out. And yet he does it seemingly effortlessly.

It's rather hard to talk more about this film without spoiling everything, but trust me when I say it's worth a watch. Personally I'd raise this to my personal Top 20. It's that good.",9.0,28 July 2014
If only we were all living in Asia...,"Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.

Firstly, his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously, Oh Dae-Soo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee Yu-Jin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo. In South Korea, criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven/overlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed, which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh Dae-Soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus, he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee Yu-Jin could play with him at his own discretion.

Secondly, nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him, I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So, please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.

I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean, most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.

I hope my talk helps.",9.0,26 May 2019
old boy... good movie,"I from Korean , my name is Park Jung Wook and my English name is Chuk! This movie is very exciting , very nice sound em..... very nice interesting Old Boy sucks! No, wait, let me rephrase that: Old Boy is a stylistically challenging, highly innovative, but ultimately hollow and repugnant exercise in genre film-making. And just to let you know where I'm coming from  'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance' was brilliant; an unforgiving and touching descent into doom. In that movie everything that happened somehow had to. One action triggered the next one and we experienced a vicious circle of violence and revenge. The characters seemed trapped in their situation. This movie good movie and very exciting My advice to people who haven't watched this film yet: Go see it! This is definitely a must- see. If you have a weak stomach , pull yourself together and still watch it. Don't be as shallow as a lot of people here tend to be.",10.0,18 March 2009
Revenge And Hatred?,"I thought that Old Boy was a great piece of film work. The gritty violence and in your face hatred just added to the scenes for the movie. Quentin Tarantino even said some great items about this independent film. I could only have imagined being imprisoned for fifteen (15) years and then being released. I knew that one of the driving factors on my mind would be revenge and to find the beast that was responsible for the incident. I would make the monster suffer and to suffer dearly once I got my hands on him. Old Boy showed the determination of one man and what he was willing to do to find the kidnapper that led to his ordeal. It delivered much more that I read about it and that was a great sign of an independent movie. I am always willing to have more than less. If you have ever thought about any type of revenge or deep hatred for another human being, I suggest that you watch Old Boy first. It might change your mind and steer you in another direction.

Well that was different...,"Oldboy is a really interesting and messed up movie. You may need to be a right kind of person (or perhaps a wrong kind of person) to watch it. It is not going to be for everyone's tastes, which is all the more surprising just how well it has been received.

This film was really something else. Something I have not seen before.

The scenes in this movie catch you off guard, with your mental pants down. You think you are about to see something but then it surprises you ahead of time with a close up of something else. Your mind is hopelessly out-gunned. And there you sit, with your mouth open wondering what the next scene may bring next or what other camera angle they will invent. Just remember to breath in between the scenes. And it is awesome.

You may have seen graphic movies before, movies that pour gore and yelling all over you like a big electric saw. Oldboy is less like a saw and more like a scalpel or needle piercing the skin.

Having said that, Oldboy tries a bit too hard. It becomes obvious that it tries to shock you with a new image or thought or sick twist.

It goes a bit over the top in certain parts, sometimes breaking a mostly serious and realistic tone with a more extreme cartoony style, which is not surprising considering its manga roots.

Towards the end of the film, when some key things get revealed, the explanation is a bit contrived, deus-ex-machina-ish if you will. You have to buy into the movie wholly to buy what the story sells.

The music was very interesting and noticeable. There was a fight scene and you get a minimalistic track of a lonely trumpet and beats. And it totally works, making a scenes take on a wholly different tone than you would expect.

If you can stomach its style, Oldboy is a movie that needs to be seen once in a lifetime. It was a mind-bending experience.",8.0,19 December 2014

What I did think was however, is that it is one of the most powerfully moving and tragic movies I have ever seen. And it is packaged as a gripping, slickly made thriller that one can't help but devour right until the shocking climax, which hits you like a ton of bricks. And another nice thing is that the movie doesn't lose any of its emotional/psychological impact on repeat viewings. Not only does this movie boast an excellent plot and screenplay, it has wonderful acting, gorgeous cinematography and a divine soundtrack.

"A brutal, haunting, dark and brilliantly twisted masterpiece","This demented Korean revenge thriller is one of the rare movies which despite being absolutely full of graphic violence, unpleasant scenes and shocking twists is still brilliant, strangely beautiful and captivating. Oldboy tells the story of a man held in solitary confinement for 15 years, who is released without explanation and is given 5 days to find the identity of his captor and find out the truth. The truth hurts. Oldboy is a strange, powerful and twisted tale of revenge. It starts off slow and will to be too much for some to take, but it's not quite as bad as you've probably heard in terms of the violence, although the plot is brutal and disturbing. Oldboy is a hypnotically brilliant movie in almost every way and manages not to feel like mean spirited trash. Oldboy is an incredibly powerful film because of the emotions it depicts. Almost a foreign Get Carter, it's captivating due to its convincing portrayal of the extremes of human emotions and powerful performances.

The various actors in the film, who I haven't encountered as I'm not at all familiar with Korean cinema, are extraordinary. The main character is flawed and well rounded, while the villain is one of the sickest and most disturbing on screen bad guys ever. It's got a twisty and unpredictable plot, leading one of the most shocking twist endings of all time. The fascinating and brilliant story is what makes the film so memorable, but Chan-Wook Park creates a visually brilliant and utterly nightmarish canvas for the story to unfold on. The film looks absolutely extraordinary and although it's not an action based film, the one take corridor fight sequence is 3 minutes of beautiful, badass combat I'll never forget. Oldoby, overall, is a twisted, haunting masterful revenge tale with the power of a hammer blow between the eyes. A true nightmare you won't want to wake up from, this is a perfect example of how to make bleak art. A masterpiece.

Absolutely amazing film,"Thank you, Denis Bakirov, now that's my fav movie!",10.0,2 January 2019
Fantastic movie - not for everyone,"Lot's of reviews for this title already but I just have to write one, too.

When I saw this movie for the first time I really liked it. I finally watched it again and this time my admiration reached a peak.

This movie is fantastic in almost every way.

The cinematography is gorgeous. I love every scene, every shot of the camera, the atmosphere is amazing not to forget the creativity in presenting the pictures; colorful, original, inventive - like many Asian movies are. However many influences of famous non-Asian filmmakers can be found. I was reminded of directors like Kubrick, Fincher or Tarantino. I also loved how some of the scenes where cut and put together. The pace of the movie is also really balanced. There are times to cool down, parts when the picture takes time to develop in depth and atmosphere followed by ""action"" scenes that come along literally like a hammer on your head. Completed is the whole with a fantastic and perfectly placed score. I think classical music playing over violent scenes did not sound that beautiful since ""A clockwork orange"".

The main character (go look up his name) gives an incredible performance. Absolutely crazy, emotionally gripping and most important believable.

Not as believable may seem the plot for some people ...

A drunk man is kidnapped on the street and trapped for 15 years of his life in what looks like a shabby ""hotel room"". His only friend during this time is the telly. He gets food through a small shutter in the door and after being intoxicated with gas, the kidnappers clean up the room, wash his clothes and cut his hair. He never gets in contact with other people and is not told who is doing this to him or why. The reason why he is not going totally mad is his rage and need for revenge. Finally he is free again and tries to find the guys and kill them. Now this might not sound as complex as it actually is. Maybe even a bit too complex. The revelation kinda is a bit improbable but I think it still could work... and within this movie it definitely worked for me.

It's an extremely powerful movie, even disturbing not only for the gore itself. In fact this whole movie is pretty violent and therefore I can not recommend this for everybody. But it is not violence for its own sake but really has a purpose and also a motivation. This film is a complex character study about the alienation of an isolated man and how human psyche is influenced and/or manipulated.

My only little problem that I had with the movie especially the first time I watched it is the confusion. Not only the plot is quite confusing and at times hard to follow but most of the trouble I had with the picture was memorizing and assigning all these Asian names to the correct characters. They all sound so strange and similar that I was wondering more than once ""Who is that person they were just talking about again?"". The second time around this was not longer the case and I finally fell in love with the movie.

All in all this is an extraordinary experience that you definitely don't see very often or maybe haven't ever seen before. It is unique, compelling, violent, creative, at times funny and perfectly crafted.

Cause of some weaknesses in the plot (developement) I rate this film ""only"" 9/10.

So ******* see it!",10.0,6 June 2010

A Captivating Journey of Revenge and Redemption,"Have you ever watched a movie so captivating that it stays with you long after the credits have rolled? Oldboy is one of those movies that has earned its status as one of the best Korean films of all time, captivating audiences with its gripping storyline and masterful execution.

At the heart of the story is Oh Dae-su, the protagonist who finds himself imprisoned for 15 years without any explanation. This intense premise immediately grabs the audience's attention, immersing them in Oh Dae-su's nightmarish world. But what is the reason behind this outrageous act? The gradual unfolding of secrets and enigma builds up to the climax that will leave you eager and intrigued.

Director Park Chan-wook's artistic visualization of the action and the mystery with the help of subtle visuals and shades of fluorescence allows the audience to be witnesses to an immersive experience. It's not just the storyline that captured the audience, but also the exceptional performance of the protagonist Choi Min-sik. His portrayal of the tortured and conflicted Oh Dae-su brings depth and intensity to an already captivating character.

Screenplay and cinematography also play a significant role in making Oldboy a movie that resonates with viewers. The screenplay is exceptionally well-written, keeping the audience engaged from start to finish, while the cinematography captures the rawness and beauty of each scene.

The movie indeed delves deep into the exploration of the main character's traumas and suffering, as he embarks on a quest for answers and redemption. The journey he undertakes is a compelling one, filled with emotional complexity and layers of storytelling.

Oldboy also explores the significance of considering the outcome before speaking and the consequences of impulsive actions.

The antagonist's sadistic nature may lead you to suspect his motives for seeking retribution. Still, his character manages to play the role of a helper to the hero and adds a deeper dimension to the overall narrative.

Oldboy's unique and visceral story structure and themes of resilience make it an exceptional cinematic masterpiece. It is an experience that taps into the depths of human emotions, leaving an indelible mark on anyone who watches it.

As you embark on this captivating journey of revenge and redemption, it is sure to leave a sublime experience that will stay with you for a very long time.",9.0,5 August 2023

"A great Hitchcock movie, and perhaps a homage to an American Actor","That the director of this film liked Hitchcock films is clearly evident. Though I would have to put also in there Brian De Palma (Another Hitchcock devotee) since the film was reminiscent for me of his film Obsession.

The movie is very suspenseful, though I have to admit very unreal. You mean to tell me you can be locked up for 15 years, watch TV, practice fighting by yourself, and knock out 22 guys at a time. Though perhaps one could think that these characters were told to make sure they didn't kill or triumph over this main character by the protagonist. Much of the other issues of the film, regarding his 15 years of captivity are in my opinion far fetched.

As for the age of the protagonist, on the DVD I saw, the commentary by the director gives his explanation of the youthfulness of the protagonist.

If you can stand the violence of this film, I recommend it, but I can't say I would want to see the other works of this director, though I believe some say his other two revenge films are better.

The acting by the lead actor is excellent, (Sorry that I can't put his name down), we see him go from this drunken fat slob, to becoming a supper man. Also something that I noticed, which others I don't believe have mentioned. When the main character becomes this superman, he bears a curious resemblance to an American actor who died the same year this film was released, that actor being Charles Bronson.

Wow!,"When I watched it for the second time, however, I really started to notice how well it's made, in addition to liking it more.

The actors really gave it all, especially the 2 male leads who really blew me away. The music is a varied mix of beautiful classical music and some pretty cool techno. The screenplay is brilliant; the characters are developed very well, extremely complex, and the plot is not only ingenious, but the payoff and twists are 1000x better than any Shamaylan movie.

Simply put, from a technical point of view, it's one of the best movies ever. From a critic's point of view, it is a very well-done movie that goes a little overboard in sex and violence, and is just a little strange.",10.0,10 March 2012

A simple plot to begin with. A man, taken and imprisoned for 15 years in solitary confinement is released suddenly and has a limited amount of time to figure out the meaning behind his captivity.

Chan-wook Park at his finest, this beautifully told story twists and turns through the beautiful landscape that is Korea.

Don't really want to go into plot details or anything concerning the ""meat"" of the film, but this is something I have watched over and over and have enjoyed every-time.

Side-note.

I guess you could say the violence is graphic and not suitable and if you're easily squeamish be prepared. Personally, I love how the violence is portrayed and at no time do I find it over the top in any way and I don't see any glorification of it for the sake of shock (i.e) Hostel, etc.

This films burns more as a psychological thriller and has those same bone-chilling moments brought on by ""Silence of the Lambs"" An original thriller for a modern audience, a must see for anyone interested in superb film making.

Anarchy!,"The intrinsic nature of the Woo Jin Lee & his erratic revenge is pure & utterly brilliant in it's form. This movie is about revenge, pure. And it's furiously paced with a very twisted plot. But only when it needs to slow down & focus on the basis of Woo Jin Lee's revenge, it takes it's time & gives us a brief, but excellent narrative of what his revenge consists of.

It's a rare movie, very few to come by. Imagine art-house action fantasy (The exceptional fight-off sequences), blended with a very dark & gripping synopsis, stylishly blended and served on a well dressed celluloid platter. The gore is in loads & the sinister plot demands some good moments of it, where patches of blood draining from faces & bodies is justified, because Oh Dae Su's ruthless rampage to reason his enduring punishment of 15 years is utterly relentless, only to find out that his struggle is worthless, for Woo Jin Lee, has a very dark hidden secret for him, a plan which he brilliantly executes, & is worth admiring while it unfolds in front of you.

There is no hero in the movie. It reflects strongly on human nature & the way we all perceive things. One man's strong revenge for something does not make him a villain, when you realize what the basis of his revenge his. We all wish we could avenge for something & bring someone to justice. If we do, would that make us evil?

One of the most well made plot twist in the history of cinema,"It's amazing how few details can make you completely reevaluate your whole vision of a film. Personally, I was a bit confused most of the time, many things seemed to make no sense or forced, but during the last 20 minutes, everything was finally clear.

Many scenes are shot well and with style, even if not perfectly. The lead actor gave a performance, for my taste, outstanding.

The reasons why I don't consider this film a masterpiece, It's because for the slightly too far-fetched and over the top atmosphere of certain events, also the screenplay tends to focus quite a bit on the final plot twist.",9.0,31 May 2023
Butterfly effect,"This movie goes directly to sensitive, and knows how to do it; it's a scratch to the moral of the world, for showing the true(ugly) behind the characters.

That kind of revenge is far from people, but some beings are not as human, and that should be enough to explore into the movie. A kind of wicked mind should have write the movie, but inside the heart, eveybody can become a Daesu, a Woojin for nothing, that's the key, for ""nothing"". In Old Boy you can see through the demons that can rip or steal the soul.

I don't think is a movie for everyone, though everyone should experience this movie, because it shows what some words can do... a twister or so.",9.0,21 August 2005
Description of Oldboy,"I've seen thousands of movies that supposedly ""shock"" and ""disgust"" the moviegoer, but Oldboy took this to a new level. Rather then using gore or gratuitous sex or violence to ""shock"" me this very intelligent thriller used an entirely different method. Needless to say this is a movie I will never forget as long as I live, and it represents something that not only kept me in rapt attention and thoroughly entertained, it opened up my eyes to the abilities of the human emotional spectrum and turned my stomach as to the depths of humanity. A movie I would recommend for everyone to see, just because of the time spent after it is finished reflecting upon ones self. People who do not like this movie do not understand it, and Oldboy deserves to be placed on a pedestal above any other movie attempting to serve up the same kind of action or drama. Ten stars, exceptional film, any faults are minor and covered by the charisma of the actors and brilliance of the cinematographer. Recommended for all, even the weak of heart, since a masterpiece can be appreciated by all.",10.0,3 April 2005
Grand Prize Winner,"I first had the privilege of viewing Oldboy at the Toronto Film Festival back in 2004. I knew nothing of the film and even less about the actors or the director prior to the screening, but I somehow ended up with tickets for the late night viewing. The local newspaper quoted the tagline, 15 years forced in a cell, only 5 days given to seek revenge, so I was expecting a violent indulgence (and let's get one thing clearAsian violence and Hollywood violence are two separate entities). What I wasn't expecting was a movie that would stick with me days later and end up as one of the best films of 2004.

Oldboy opens by introducing us to Oh Dae-Su as he gets wisped off the streets and is imprisoned in a holding cell for what will amount to 15 years. The cell has a bed, bathroom and television, but there are no windows. A steel door with only a small opening at the bottom so that food can be delivered is all that connects him to the outside world. Gas is emitted into the room periodically to subdue Dae-Su allowing a crew to provide medical attention where necessary or attend to any housekeeping agendas. Dae-Su's next decade and a half will consist of watching television and staying fit in hopes of an eventual release and identifying both his capture and the reason for his incarceration.

That day finally arrives when Dae-Su awakes in the middle of nowhere. The world around him is foreign and the movie takes just the right amount of time showing us how Dae-Su appreciates new smells, communications with others, cigarettes and even new swear words.

A cell phone found ringing in his jacket pushes the story to the next chapter. The voice on the other end of the line is that of his former captor that reveals that a game is about to be played and that Dae-Su's job is to figure out the who's and why's that reasons Dae-Su's captivity. Dae-Su seems numb to the voice but passes out soon afterwards only to awaken at the house of Mido, his waitress at the restaurant at the time of his collapse. Their relationship will take center stage as the two new acquaintances try to unravel the mystery man behind the wizards' curtain that seems to be pulling all the strings.

Revealing any further information about Oldboy might take away from the pleasure of letting the story unfold, so I'll stop here. But what I will tell you is that through Dae-Su's journey towards various reveals we are treated to memory etching scenes including the self mutilation of one's tongue and an absolutely invigorating scene involving Dae-Su's battle with an Asian gang down a narrow corridor armed only with a hammer and utter determination.

Oldboy has just enough of all the right elements to make a good film better. The mood, pacing, lighting and even the music punctuate through the screen to create an atmosphere of dread, sorrow and desperation. But what separates Oldboy from the pack is that it paints a picture of a character that thinks he can walk through the violent world of the Asian underground with reckless abandon on the notion that nothing can be done to him physically or emotionally that could compare to the hell of his 15-year imprisonment. But in the final act, director Chan-wook Park (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance) turns the table on our protagonist and forces him into the realization that as a pawn in the sick and twisted game, he is not the cold and fearless seeker or truth, but rather a vulnerable and forever imprisoned character that pleads his own life in order to maintain a level of secrecy over the final revelation. The payoff is one that you just won't see coming no matter how seasoned a veteran you may be to films of this genre, and it incaptures everything that Hollywood films would steer clear of if originally presented the script in raw form. And the result was the Grand Prize of the Jury award at Cannes in 2004.

BURN Hollywood BURN!,"1st things 1st: ""OLDBOY"" is based on a Japanese Manga (Graphic Novels) and therefore is as real as say ""Lone Wolf & Cub"" or ""Spider-Man"" for that matter!

Bottom Line is this: MONTEPYTHON_ROCKS's all-time favorite movie was ""SPEED 2"" until ""Gigli"" came out now she's confused, What I really meant to say is if you like Takashi Miike's works of art: ""Fudoh"", ""Ichi the Killer"", ""Audition"" etc. then chances are you'll enjoy ""OLDBOY"" as much as I did...And I really liked it!",9.0,5 May 2005

A Film that Shows Perpatratiors as Victims and Vice Versa,"Oldboy easily one of the three best movie I have seen in 2005. Although it was made two years earlier, this is when it made a theatrical run in my area and I'm glad I was able to even see it theatrically. Easily one of the best foreign films to come in sometime and could only have been made in a foreign land due to the themes and twists involved in the feature.

The plot is already listed so no need to go over that. As far as the film goes, it takes a fresh angle on revenge where those commit crimes are also victims and as the movie goes on both the protagonist and antagonist are developed so while we still root for the hero, we sympathize with the villain just enough to keep him a bad guy. It's use of violence in the rawest form gives it a realistic undertone and shows how consumed a man is by vengeance he doesn't stop with even a knife is his back. In one of many memorable scenes, the hero takes on a room of fifteen guys with nothing but a hammer and it plays out almost as real as it could get.

As for the twists, which I will speak little of, all there is to say is they are red herrings that are very hard to figure out but aren't just meant to make you go ""wow!"" There is meaning to it and is part of a the story's flow. It's hard to find movie that use that kind of tactic when surprising the audience anymore.

The performances are spot on and the direction uses style for substance and not once is a neat effect use just for looking cool, it all adds up to something. So overall, an awesome film to come out of the Asian market that isn't martial arts or an epic drama set in the past, but one that takes place in present time in the vicious city where good and bad people roam the streets just like USA and Europe. And the violence is almost poetic in getting it's point across. The director's revenge trilogy takes the age old formula of vengeance and puts it a new spin on it creating modern classics that should give anyone with an open mind a visual pleasure.",10.0,24 January 2006

1000 emotions in one movie,"Let me start off by saying I have seen this movie more than 3 times in the last week. You might ask why. Why would anyone waste their time and watch the same movie 3 times in one week? The answer i leave you with, is because this movie is human.

In the first 5 minutes of the movie, the main character is kidnapped. From then on, i was completely sucked into the movie. Every action that the main character does is incredibly human. what i mean by that is, if you were him, you'd do the same thing as him. This isn't a crazy ""all the sudden, i become a hero"" kind of story that Hollywood gives you. This movie reaches down into every possible emotion that i can think of, and it does it very very well. I spent more time thinking about the movie than the 2 hours of absolute genius that it offers you.

The acting in this movie is SUPERB. All of the actors are very well casted, and perform a superb job. I dare say that there are no bad actors in this whole movie.

Revenge is the theme of this movie. Some say revenge only brings more blood, but the acting had me convinced that the bad guys deserved everything the get. As i said earlier, the acting is amazing. I can't even start to describe it using words. I even thought that it was better than Kevin Spacey in The Usual Suspects, and on par with Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left foot. The acting in the movie would EASILY be nominated for Oscars and probably win it too.

I am unable to run out of complements for this movie, because the movie was so well made. After watching over 300 movies in the last 3 years, I believe this movie deserves to be on the top 100 movies on this website.

I can honestly say that this movie is 2 hours of pleasure that you wont regret.",9.0,7 March 2006
Absurdity of hate and revenge.,"The plot outline provided by IMDb is quite inaccurate.

The protagonist disappears without a trace one rainy night after a boozy night.

He is not jailed and paroled. He is kidnapped, drugged regularly and kept imprisioned for 15 years without ever getting an explanation until he manages to escape (or so he believes).

Once outside he plots revenge against his captors, but without suspecting why he runs into a cute, young girl he has seen on TV (that became his only contact with the outside world) which will eventually play the biggest part on the protagonist's fate in unsuspected, chilling ways.

The movie is quite a wild ride and will be infamous for its moment of gastronomic audacity and madness.

Although the plot thickens quite a bit in towards the end and some of the propositions are a bit stretched, some questions posed by the movie are quite interesting: would you be happy living without knowing terrible truths? Is love without reserve always a good thing?

The movie has some quite realistic (for East Asian cinema tastes) fight scenes in which the hero beats gangs of young assailants, in contrast with Chinese action movies or even some Hollywood action movies, the protagonist is badly beaten, dragged and humiliated until the point of self destruction.

But at the end he prevails. Kind of...",8.0,22 October 2004
Solid film-making and thrilling story-telling,"Oldboy tells the story of a man imprisoned for fifteen years for crimes unknown to him. Oh Dae-su has five days to find out who incarcerated him and why. Starting from the helplessness of a clueless man stuck in a cheap hotel room, Oldboy shows Oh Dae-su's growing schizophrenia over the duration of his jail-time culminating in ruthless vengeance in finding and eliminating his enemy. Gory and explicit at most times, Oldboy spares no effort in telling the story as naturally as possible.

Fans of the Chekhov's Gun school of thought (season three of Lost, woo hoo!) should find Oldboy squarely in their alley. Numerous clues are dropped throughout the movie, providing an interesting exercise for genre fans to sleuth around. The protagonist is just as blank about his predicament as the audience, and both of us start on his journey of revenge and retribution with a clean slate. The movie keeps you on the toes at all times with its carefully crafted suspense. The tension mounts slowly, but surely, as the different pieces of the puzzle gradually fall in place. Admittedly, I didn't consider Dae-su's crimes to be a big shocker. But at the end of the day, the film is more an exploration into social mores and adventurous film-making than just a stomach-churning twist ending.

So with all these kind words, why does the movie not get a perfect score? The violence in the movie, which is talked about much, does not seem as hard-hitting as it should have. Even the most gory scenes are easily digested. More effective violence rather than plain gore would have better suited the film. The editing could have done with some more work. At close to two hours, the movie does seem to stretch a little. And finally, it would have been really good had the kicker been more potent.

Oldboy is a well-told tale of schizophrenia, vengeance, and morality. A fairly simple tale of revenge is wound into a more complex tale of trickery, paranoia, and a bunch of twists. Recommended!",8.0,27 October 2006

Rare Quality,"I don't believe there's many headline type words which can be used about this movie, since they all seem to already have been used. The reason is simple: Oldboy is a movie you either hate or love, although considering the subject and theme of the movie, love probably ain't the right word to use. Still, the movie seem to part it's audience and it's understandably, but unfortunately, it also reflects on it's reviews. Oldboy is a tough movie to be objective about, since you almost have to take a stance about it's story, and the problem here is, that if you like the movie, it couldn't indicate that you can also relate to what the protagonist is doing', and of course the same goes, if you don't like the movie. So what is the protagonist doing' ? he's searching for truth. It's as simple as that, but the truth about what ? On the surface its the truth about who did him wrong, but underneath, it's the truth about human nature: How dark are the dark side of homo sapience, when the fire which fuels us, has been brought to a boiling point, where we find ourselves falling' from the edge towards the darkness ? And is it possible to stop the fall by uncover the truth, or will the truth just reflect another dark aspect of human beings: That sometimes, we are so blinded by our own self-righteousness that we can't c', that it is that same self-righteousness, which pushed us over the edge to begin with. Simplistically the love/hate aspect of Oldboy can be put into a question: Is it cool to tell a friend about something you have witnessed, if you know that what you have witnessed, probably wasn't something you should have seen ? Some will say yes, some will say no - same with Oldboy: Same love it, some hate it, and for that rare quality, Oldboy is worth watching.",8.0,9 September 2005
Another magnificent film from the far end of the world!,"Whenever i watch films which i know aren't influenced by the glowing shinny lights of Hollywood, i know that i am going to enjoy it.

There is something about films such as Amelie, Delicatessen, Hero and Oldboy that i can't put my finger on. But it is there and it is one of the main things that make me enjoy the film even more. Maybe it is the little anecdotes that are displayed or the way the films unravel.

Anyhow Oldboy, i was intrigued by the movie to begin with after watching a trailer but...as i watched the film i found my self becoming more immersed inside it. The sheer determination and will of the main character to avenge who imprisoned for 15 years was really cool. And the fights scenes where Oldboy would never lose against a whole hallway of kungfu killers.

The ending was the most explosive part of the film for me where i and Oldboy got to learn why he was imprisoned for 15 years and how the other character was feeling. I truly excellent film for me as it ticked all the right boxes.

"A brilliant, emotional, yet comic book style revenge film.","Let me start by saying this- Oldboy, while being quite difficult to watch in places, is not a stereotypical ""by-numbers"" thriller which the Hollywood audience seem to have grown accustomed to in recent years. I, for one, would not have guessed the ending in a million years. The explanation for a major event in the story I found o be very unrealistic and disappointing as a result, but I can assure you that this does not make the film any worse.

The plot. A man, Dae-su Oh, is locked away in a hotel room for fifteen years, with no explanation. The only company he has is a television, which really is his window to the outside world. On the news, one day after being locked up for a while, he finds his wife has been murdered. And guess who gets the blame? Dae-su Oh essentially becomes a fugitive, locked in a tiny hotel room.

After fifteen years of being locked up, he is released- with no explanation. However, he is given new clothes, a phone, and money. Diven by is desire for revenge, he embarks on a journey that truly makes you feel for this (as some may describe him in places) anti-hero. Eventually he comes face to face with the man responsible for getting him locked up. Dae-su Oh is given an ultimatum- he has three days to find out why he was locked up for all that time. If Dae-su Oh does not achieve this, his newly found love will be murdered.

Coming from the director of Sympathy For Mr Vengeance, this is truly piece of art. A blood-pumping, emotional, ""makes you think"" piece of art, but art nonetheless.",9.0,10 July 2005
Shocking,"After being kidnapped and imprisoned for fifteen years, Oh Dae-Su is released from his tiny cell. Though he doesn't know why he was imprisoned in the first place, or released. Though this is his task. He has five days to find out who did this and why it happened, and seek his revenge.

This is a great romp through the revenge genre and for the violence. This does have intense violence, but its not all in your face. A lot does happen without you seeing it, but psychological violence is so much worse. I wont talk about any of the scenes as the impact wont have that kick to the face that it deals out.

The look and feel is real dark and gritty. Mostly using a bleak grey wash to up the disturbing atmosphere, there are shots of seedy wood grain, contrasting scenes and giving you a few moments to relax before your shot back into the dark side of this revenge tale.

Oldboy i found did feel like the movie Saw, but did it much better. Like Saw, person is taken and locked away and must learn what they have done to survive. Though there is Kill Bill thrown in here as well; revenge to be bestowed upon all who get in Oh Dae-Su's way. The music is also like 2001, a space odyssey. Contrasting ultra modern settings with classical music, mostly violins, creating a tight dark atmosphere.

old boy deserves the win,"Set in Korea 15 years ago, Oh Daesu finds himself a captive in a hotel room that acts as a prison cell without knowing who his captor is or why he has been held. The movie follows Oh Daesu's emergence from his cell to find both himself and his captor of 15 years.

In short, old boy is a captivating revenge movie that doubles as a great, refreshing movie-going experience. While it is a polarizing film (i.e. Fight Club, Saw, movies that ppl HATE or LOVE), I guarantee most of you will like it. I came out of this one thinking, Man, I've never seen anything like this! While it may be heavily derivative of something else I don't know of, it feIt and looked highly original and well-imagined. There are some gory scenes, but nothing I would consider gratuitous within the context of a revenge thriller. Despite its considerable violence, it's not mindless and it's not cheap: the story is fantastic but the characters and their motivations are not unbelievable. The movie admirably attempts to enter the psyche of each of the pivotal characters, including one memorable scene with a large insect. This represents a great leap for Korean/world cinema, and the world would be a better place for brave cinema as this (not necessarily as violent, though).

The cinematography is gorgeous, the direction is slathered with technical excellence, and the dedication to the craft of film-making has to be seen to be believed. I found myself wanting to see the story-boards...

Tired and cynical critics will probably compare OLDBOY to other films and attempt to tear it down, these same critics probably couldn't take a digital photo without screwing it up, so beware of Western critics of Asian films. Critics are like 'focus-groupies', and all they do is moan and gripe about that which they cannot understand or appreciate.

"Fantastic film, not without faults","Wow, the reviews of this film on IMDb astound me. Now I'm not one of those hyperactive film students, a person who watches ""films"" instead of ""movies"" or someone who's trying to work their way in the business. I'm simply a college student who enjoys movies. That being said, I have to say, I absolutely loved this movie. The story (which I won't go into because it's pretty much everywhere else) was well written and acted. Dae-su does in fact appear to be quite the afflicted protagonist. It was refreshing to see a character that the audience was supposed to sympathize with not exactly be of the highest (or even a normal) moral character.

The psychology of all the characters presented in the film seems dead on to me. Many a times during the movie I couldn't help but say ""if it weren't for my morals I would do the exact same thing."" Those who can't understand why certain characters do certain things need to stop observing and think ""if that had happened to me..."" As for the ending... maybe I just don't have the negative outlook on life that some others on the board have, but I found it very surprising. Not only that, but I went with my roommate and we're both in the Navy, we've seen some crazy stuff, yet we both were sickened by how twisted it was. It was so surprising that anyone could end a movie in such a messed up fashion.

"Visually Exciting Update of ""The Count of Monte Cristo""","""Oldboy"" is a visually exciting update of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" as played out in Korean gangster style.

It is a thrilling ride that dramatically visualizes the revenge theme, much as ""Memento"" dazzled the murder mystery genre. Not only does the script, co-written by the director, create realism out of fantasy like Dumas's story, but each scene tops the next with production design, cinematography, camera movement and striking imagination. This film makes the case for cinema as a separate art form from literature, even as various proverbs and sayings are repeated with increasing irony.

I had not read much about it in advance, other than Quentin Tarantino's understandable enthusiasm, so was alternately reviled by the cruelty and enchanted by balletic juxtapositions, such as what I gather is now considered the classic ""corridor scene"" that is like ""The Matrix"" meets ""A Night at the Opera.""

If the imagery wasn't captivating enough, Min-sik Choi is mesmerizing in a tour de force lead role that demands a ceaseless exploration of emotions from catatonia to hysteria to brutality to tenderness.

Not only do U.S. audiences miss what I'm sure are many keystone cultural references throughout the film, but key dialog is unfortunately exchanged when the subtitles are white-on-white, though I'm fairly sure I was able to infer the details sufficiently to follow the twists and turns of the plot, as for all the breathless film flam the core revelations become a bit predictable as they recall other infamous noir films even as they go way beyond Dumas.

I could definitely have done without the repeating violent scenes that seemed an unnecessary tribute to ""Marathon Man,"" unless this has some resonance for Korean attitudes about teeth.

The plot is one of the finest, most intriguing i have seen and there is no shortage of violence, empathy and twists to keep it interesting till the very end.

A great film in virtually every way.,"This is a great movie. The music is excellent, the acting is superb, and the plot is intelligent. The directing has artistic merit, and I would say it is as good as in movies like Requiem for a Dream and Amelie. However, the movie is more like Requiem for a Dream in its darkness and pacing (rising action to intense climax). It is a psychological thriller though, so in that respect is nothing like Requiem for a Dream (don't take the comparison too far). Anyways, the only complaint I can make about this movie is that there is one major fighting scene that is not very well done. In addition, there are some plot elements some people may not find believable enough for their tastes, but these people probably don't enjoy psychological thrillers in general. This movie is certainly not for young people or really conservative types. It is definitely for those people who like to watch mindf*ck type movies. Highly recommended. In fact, I would say this is the best movie I've seen all year, and this year I watched Requiem for a Dream, Hotel Rwanda, The Sea Inside and Brazil. Unfortunately, I simply cannot see the upcoming Hollywood remake doing it justice. Chan-wook Park (director) and Min-sik Choi (lead actor) are just so good that I think it is unlikely anyone in Hollywood will be found that matches their talent. The action scene will be improved in the Hollywood remake, though. Still, see it in Korean. It's almost guaranteed that the Hollywood version will be inferior.",9.0,10 March 2005

I could never figure out how the ending would turn out. When the truth was revealed I literally became speechless. You think you know the ending, but you don't!

A total surprise...in a good way.,"A complete surprise for me.

I had heard lots of praise and acclaim for this film, and decided I needed to watch it. I had imagined a revengeful bloodbath in similar style to Kill Bill, but was pleasantly surprised to find very little bloodbath, but a whole lot of heart and storyline instead.

The idea of trapping someone in a cell for 15 years, and then letting them out, is quite original for its time, and its execution is just something to marvel. The cinematography and editing is fantastic, as is the entire visual scope of the film. The writing is superb, with many laughable moments coming to break the silence of the hugely dramatic moments. The much talked-about one-take fight scene in the hallway is something that will be remembered and ripped-off for years to come, as was the lobby scene in the first Matrix film.

The acting is excellent for everyone, especially the main character. His broken heart, and troubled mind lead to plenty of excellent sequences, as is his female co-star.

If I have anything bad to say, its that the movie goes on a bit long, and there should have been a bit more fleshed out of the past and why he was imprisoned without reason, just so the entire scope of the final act of the film doesn't hit you like a ton of bricks. Yes, it was probably meant to be like that, but there were more than a few scenes that could have been changed or replaced just to make the whole thing flow a touch better.

And just for the record, I can't even begin to imagine how they are going to pull off an American remake.

view just one time!,"Old Boy should be watched in a special time. That is not a film to be watched second time. I see some closer points with ""Requem For A Dream"". After viewed these films you can't find your two hour before energy. When you think happy end is coming, that is possible that you will be demonstrated. It is hard to believe or accept the end. End is the time which you are looking without thinking anything to the screen. At the end of this film if there is something bad, that is: you are crying. And the worse thing: you can not crying.

Old Boy's technical dimension is another reason to like this film. Every scene has an effective side. Especially past of Oh Desau at the high school is given wonderful and intelligent. It's certain that who is interested with cinema must see this film. For a cinema school student it's like course.",9.0,12 July 2005
Sick Plot overrated movie,"Dae-Su is a terrible drunkard released on bail from the police station by a friend. After talking to his daughter from a phone booth he disappeared. He was abducted from the street and wakes up in a cell, where he is retrained of his liberty for the next 15 years, he is constantly drugged, human contact is unavoidable, framed up for his wife's murder and provided with only the television as company. And then, suddenly released, he is invited to track down his abductor. At first I thought that I will be watching a revenge movie considering that the main character was imprisoned for 15 years without any legal basis. I was expecting an action film that turned out to be a comedy with the main focus is incest. The incestuous brother main purpose in life is to stalk the main character. The incestuous brother raised the main character's daughter since she was three only to set them up for incestuous sex. The movie is sick. What a waste of your precious time.",3.0,19 June 2017

"Great film, just don't watch the dubbed version!","My summary sums it up me thinks. Very enjoyable movie, keeps one interested and thinking through out. The English dubbing was enough to make me want to turn it off, so thank bob for subtitles. I give it a 9 out of 10 and will be checking out Mr. Parks other work. The special features are quality entertainment, especially the extended opening sequence. (the lead does some genius improv). I read a couple reviews in which the writer said the dialogue was poppy/corny/cliché or some suchness, but I have to disagree here. The dialogue served it's purpose for the film (noirish narration at times), and there were some genuinely funny lines. There are enough fight scenes to keep your average action movie buff interested, and plot twists aplenty for those who like to use their brains at the cinema. Enjoy!",9.0,18 November 2006

The fight scenes, especially the one take hallway scene, are incredible. For this actor to do much of his own stunt work was great. It gave the film a presence.

bloody impressive,"my filmgoing buddy & i really enjoyed this one. the story was a real trippy ride, and kept us wanting to know what happens next. yeah, so there are warnings about the language, violence, etc, but it wasn't sickening like i thought it would be... its usage was just enough to move the story along & in fact the viewer is spared of lots of the off-screen stuff. (for some reason, the gal in our row kept eating her popcorn during the more gruesome bits, but i needed both hands to cover my eyes for some scenes.)

why did this film blow us away? well, let's see. it was morbidly interesting. there was a mystery to be solved, like a puzzle. there were loads of unexpected things, even some surreal events. ooh, ooh! i know-- the score was beautiful, and the lauded cinematography was also worthy of its praise (even though it was filmed in a dark, overexposed gritty sort of way). all the Hollywood clichés in storytelling were mostly if not completely absent (i have to wonder if Korean natives found this movie to be ho-hum typical of eastern film-making-- prolly not, considering the awards it went for). so it was welcomely refreshing in that way.

the climax & ending offered some fine apres-theatre discussion, to try to piece together the events & what the meanings were. what is fun is that some of the mysteries can't be solved with a textbook answer, 'cos AFAIK the writer/director deliberately left in ambiguity. what was the glowing thing in the suitcase in Pulp Fiction? well, is that wholly important? it's whatever you thought it was... but you knew it was impressively valued. what does the final scene in Oldboy signify? well, you're in luck, viewer, b/c you aren't dictated to what to feel and how to interpret... like other types of art, you can interact with this film & come up with meaning yourself. but, you aren't cheated out of answers either.

can't wait to see this again!

Many of you were wondered why Soo- ah had to get killed by her brother because of rumor. That explains this. There are some dialects that you can not possibly translate into English,which is funny and meaningful. Anyway I agree that this movie is violent and hard to watch.

Bizarrely Lauded Comic Book Adaptation,"Oddly very few comments remark on the fact that this is a comic adaptation, because that's exactly how the film strikes me. I watched this very close to watching ""The Punisher"" and would be hard pressed to say why this is lauded as a masterpiece and ""The Punisher"" is pulp. The plot is pretty well incoherent, which given the nature of what one can make out is just as well. The acting is awful. The ludicrous fight scenes make WWF look realistic, and teeth pulling was far more sinister in ""Marathon Man"". ""Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance"" is far better (though very short of being a great film) but the risible ""Lady Vengeance"" and this suggests that Park is the latest over-hyped Asian talent.",5.0,23 July 2008
"Dark, disturbing, brilliant.","Oldboy is a Korean film based on the Japanese Manga of the same name. It is definitely one of the more known Korean films that has been released in recent history which I believe established Park Chan-woo's name to the rest of the world. As it's a really tightly wound plot with twist and turns galore, I'll just say that it centres around vengeance and revenge in a dark manner.

First off, Choi Min-sik delivers one of the best performances I've seen in a long time. The desperation, hope and then hopelessness, joy, despair and weakness are all played out with such commitment that you feel it with him. Yu Ji-Tae, the antagonist, plays a rather more understated role but I felt he had such presence that I looked forward to his appearances. The 2 leads carry most of the film and it really just centres around them both.

The cinematography is definitely different to what I've seen and it was refreshing. The Manga influence shows through with most shots towards the end, and I'm sure they were close to how it was portrayed in the manga. Then there is that famous one-shot fight scene that's pretty impressive when you think about it. It has caught a bit of flak for the excessive violence and sex scenes but I felt they just added more to the plot and keeping the viewer immersed. Definitely a must-watch.",9.0,13 March 2013
Park Chan-wook's 'Oldboy' a Haunting and Masterful Revenge Thriller that Demands Attention,"""Oldboy"", directed by Park Chan-wook, is a powerful and disturbing film that demands to be seen. From the very beginning, the audience is thrown into a world of violence and revenge that is both shocking and mesmerizing. The story follows Oh Dae-su, a man who has been imprisoned for 15 years without any explanation. When he is finally released, he sets out on a mission to uncover the truth and exact revenge on those who wronged him. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that nothing is as it seems, and the twists and turns keep the audience on the edge of their seats until the very end.

What sets ""Oldboy"" apart from other revenge thrillers is its attention to detail and depth of character. Oh Dae-su is a complex and flawed protagonist who struggles with his own demons throughout the film. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with each actor delivering a standout performance that adds to the film's overall impact.

Park Chan-wook's direction is masterful, with every shot and edit serving a purpose in the storytelling. The film's use of color and sound is particularly noteworthy, with a haunting score that perfectly complements the dark and moody visuals.

Overall, ""Oldboy"" is a cinematic masterpiece that should not be missed. Its themes of vengeance, redemption, and the human condition will leave a lasting impression on viewers long after the credits roll.",10.0,28 March 2023
Oldboy: A Violent and Haunting Masterpiece,,9.0,20 March 2023
A Must See For All Adults,"Oldboy is based off a manga (like many pulp Asian movies such as Ichi The Killer). However, not confuse you with the nature of most Asian pulp movies, this one was done with all seriousness and a great cast as well as director.

If ever, you are searching for a movie that has one of those endings that make you sit up in your seat, or race to be the first one in the living room to shout the 'concluding answer', then this movie is for you.

The movie is pretty long for you pretty much being extremely confused (two hours), however, every little thing in the movie is pretty much necessary, if not to define Daesu (Oldboy), but to truly hit you in the end.

Oldboy takes the human aspect of several details and puts you on a near week odyssey of a man trying to commit to vengeance and a quest to find the truth behind 'why' and 'who'. The movie was suggested to me by one of my friends when I asked for a movie title that would leave me struck and speechless in the end. This movie was suggested and I regret buying it and waiting a week to watch it, as it was ultimately the best foreign film I have seen.",9.0,21 April 2009
Top of my list!,"Oldboy is certainly one of my favorite films of all time. It is, in my own opinion, the perfect balance of brutality and drama. It shows that if a man is given enough reasons, he will see nothing but revenge.

As most of you already know, the story involves a man (Oh-Dea Su)being captured and held captive for unknown reasons. After 15 years, he is suddenly released and he only has a fews days to figure out who did this to him and even more important, why.

Sadly, this movie fall in the ""less I tell you, the better"" category but I will say this. While this is not a perfect movie (no movies are), I can honestly say that every aspect of this picture is done with care and with an almost flawless attention. Every shot is beautiful. All of the characters have good reasons and motivation to act the way they do. It is a violent film but there is a purpose to it all and in the end, it could move you to tears.

I want to take time and make a special mention to the soundtrack. A great example that powerful imagery can be amplified if you have to right track. It is simply awesome and make a good movie into a great one. The storyline is also worth a mention. It's very strong on its own but its the way it's told. Many questions are asked from the beginning and you get a good pace throughout to get all the answers you need.

Not an easy film but a very very enjoyable one.Highly recommended for anyone that like effective drama and/or violence.",9.0,10 June 2013
"Deceptively gripping, hypnotic ride","Deceptively gripping, we're taken on a hypnotic ride down a slow-burn revenge opus. The payoff is thunderous, with a conclusion that could only be described as a visceral Shakespearean flourish. The final 20 minutes devastates like a sledgehammer, and its morbidity will forever be imprinted in my mind. The aggravating plot might not be for everyone, but for those who can stomach its psychological brutality, Oldboy will prove to be a masterpiece like no other. Never have I been so conflicted as to whether or not to recommend a film! A poetic soundtrack and compelling performances complements this jaw-dropper of a Korean neo-noir drama perfectly. If you have yet to see this one, you miss. In my opinion, the greatest Korean film of all time, and an amazing parable on revenge. What a story, what a screenplay, what a protagonist... Excellent performances only seem to aid the plot of a person who is imprisoned for 15 years for no reason, and who attempts to find out who is responsible for this. Great direction and excellent, hard edged visuals. The action is beautifully orchestrated and choreographed, and I still firmly believe that the corridor fight scene is one of the best film sequences ever. The villain is bizarrely engaging, and I can't seem to either hate or love him, particularly because of his ambiguity, immorality, charm and troubled past. The ending shocked me, to say the least, and the twist was unprecedented and impossible to predict. I'm also adding some unsettling, symbolic imagery in this one that is merely transcended by lovely cinematography. Though some parts of the film might drag a bit, it doesn't make the experience any less amazing than it already is. I definitely recommend this one.",9.0,21 March 2023

Oldboy : A Park Chan Wook film which has divided viewers into two different camps.,"Park Chan Wook's film ""Old Boy"" has divided viewers into two different camps. On the one hand there are many viewers who have voiced their positive opinions about it. On the other hand, there are also some viewers who have not been able to understand this film and its message of revenge. Whatever one might say, there is no point in going into details regarding this film's popularity neither would it be worthwhile to discuss its notoriety. All that can truly be said about ""Old Boy"" directed by Korean iconoclast filmmaker Park Chan Wook is that it can make one learn more about a Korean person's psyche. This aspect of human behavior is revealed in the character of Oh Dae Su whose role has been amazingly played with heavenly aplomb, tremendous maturity and remarkable agility by Korean actor Choi Min Sik. A film critic has to be trusted when he states that a film like this has not been made in the recent past. This is one of those rare Asian films which doesn't walk on the crutches of exotic Asian elements even for a second. There is one sincere advice for the Victorian prudes who criticized the scene in which an Octopus is eaten alive. Kindly have a look at Pasolini's film ""Salo"". Compared to that film the octopus scene appears like an angelic infant. Those viewers who lambasted the portrayal of incest, it must be told that it has always been a part of human civilization since olden times. Hence, why are some people making unnecessary noises now about its depiction ? The best thing about ""Old boy"" is that it makes us aware of the fact that the time connection is extremely important for all of us. Everything about the film is brilliant indeed mind boggling. Whether it is catchy music, quick pace, ample suspense, raw violence or maudlin melodrama. ""Old boy"" is a first class product in the truest sense of the word. It is a film which gives its viewer complete value for money. Whichever format one chooses to watch this film, it is surely going to rest in the viewer's mind for a long time.",10.0,20 September 2014

This middle-aged man suddenly finds himself imprisoned, after 15 years, he is released no reasons given. While he is seeking for his revenge, he realizes that himself is the object of another revenge. Despite the mind-numbing suffering in the movie, it is about love. But it is love that is misplaced. Does that make love still as what we think what love is? Oldboy certainly asks the question, and creates the climate for the audience to form their answer in a fair way. The magnificent acting makes us more involved. The story line is so well connected and the suspense of the story progress so cleverly. For those who like to receive a thank you to listen to this man's saddening story, you will not regret it as long as you are open enough to see the love that is blurred and hidden within the violence.",8.0,25 August 2012

Plot : An average family man with a wife and a daughter is being kidnapped and his wife is killed and he gets framed for the murder and his daughter is made an orphan. He is being set as a prisoner in an isolated room for 15 years without being informed as to why he's kept there. He tries to escape, tries suicide but all in vain. Exactly after 15 years he's released from the room without any explanation. The remaining story revolves on him finding who is his captor and why he did this to him and who takes the final vengeance.

A very enlightening look at life, love, revenge and the importance of keeping your mouth shut. The production of the film is way better then I expected. The camera effects seem to be a little forced into the film but they fit in pretty good. There are a few fantasy scenes with some visually pleasing graphics thrown in.

Intense Korean thriller...,"I have been wanting to see ""Oldboy"" after reading some rave reviews.

Just the thought of watching a movie in Korean language, subtitled in English was making me postpone it! Anyway, I caught it on the Sundance channel the other night, and I watched with amazement, as what unfolded on screen was one of the most powerful stories of vengeance I have ever come across.

This is not your ordinary, run of the mill Asian action movie. Although it may seem like it is...in the first half; but as the mystery begins to unravel, you realize that this is something different altogether! The complete package comes as a brutal, disturbing and shocking tale of revenge that is bound to haunt you for a long time after the movie ends.

Min-sik Choi delivers a terrific performance as Dae-Su Oh.

This movie is certainly not for the squeamish..it contains some scenes that are difficult to sit through.

An important note for viewers from India (especially lovers of Bollywood movies): Please see ""Oldboy"" before you see the upcoming Sanjay Gupta movie ""Zinda"", starring Sanjay Dutt. It is a blatant copy of ""Oldboy"", as is obvious from the plot line and the trailer. After you see ""Oldboy"" you may not want to see ""Zinda"" after all, since you wouldn't want to spoil the powerful effect of the former.",9.0,4 January 2006
"""And now?""","This movie is great and anybody saying otherwise is either jealous of its brilliance or hasn't got a clue. I won't bother in explaining the plot since knowing it will only ruin you some surprises (but I saw the movie aware of the final twist and it didn't make it any worse), and, if you already know it, what for? I think the biggest mistake is to take this as a normal movie with a normal plot and characters with normal motivations. Because is not. (SPOILERS AHEAD)This is a movie about revenje and who says revenje needs a reason? stop looking for one: that's OldBoy's whole point: a reason doesn't make any difference. You could take revenje on virtually everything. The whole sister story is probably just there to introduce incest's subject (which is not treated as a sin, but, rather, as a punishement), not to explain anything. This movie is so great because the director seems to know exactly how much information we need at every time to follow him; sequences are never too long or shot (save for the ending maybe?), and include some highlights such as...yeah, the giant ant, and of course the one in which Dae beats up 20 guys in a very Kill Bill fashion. WOrds are concise and beautiful, and music...a world apart. And the details...the line when Guy and Girl are screwing, that seems so pointless, assumes a huge, terrible meaning when we hear it again at the end of the movie. Does that make you think? It is conceivable to sexually hurt a girl, but what happens when you hear it again knowing it is your daughter? Or like the seventy steps the ""Monster"" takes at the end...

Every little detail, every little scene is meaningful to the whole movie, and it is in that detail that unknowingly gets the viewers fallen into the movies. The fight scene in the corridor... I gotta say, it's one of the best scenes one could ever make, since it is an uncut fight scene in a closed space, making it as real as it can get. As to the music, I gotta say, the music is so powerful that every time I hear the OST, I feel like I am on a hunt for revenge. Overall, the acting of Choi Min Sik is what made this movie big, even though he himself is not a young Brad Pitt kind of character, it's all in his eyes, and the way he speaks. I hope the viewers enjoyed this movie, as for there are a lot of Korean movies that have interesting and powerful stories as Old Boy. Since the Korean movie industry is not as rich as Hollywood, it would be quite impossible to create a Gladiator or a Star Wars effect due to its budget, yet the way Koreans put together complex and powerful stories shows how much talent they have.",10.0,8 May 2006

Now that being said my advice is to just watch the movie in Korean and read subtitles.

Don't listen to critics when it comes to foreign movies; especially if the critic is from another culture different than that of the intended audience (Korean language speaker). I don't have much else to say because I don't want it to be spoiled. Just take the movie as it is and don't try to pick it apart.

Cinematic Masterpiece,"See title.

This film is just that, a masterpiece. The tone perfectly matches the pace of the film itself. It manages to give off a sense of hope through slowly building it up, then totally decimates that feeling just as quickly, proceeding to repeat again until the climax of the film is reached.

Daesu is a tragic character through and through, and the film keeps you cheering him on through every hardship, every punch, every blow. His struggles in turn become your struggles and you feel a certain empathy towards this man who has lost and gained everything through the whim of another. The transformation his character undergoes from the beginning of the movie is absolutely staggering and a testament to the human spirit, as well as its weaknesses.

Others have said that this film is overrated; in order to be so, it would need to have much more viewership and have wide-spread knowledge and influence. Sadly, it does not have any of these qualities as of yet, so one must argue that it is actually underrated and badly in need of more viewers. I can't stress that enough - more film-goers need to see Oldboy.

The film itself is dark and gritty, which is really an understatement. Colors are always displayed in drab earth-tones and mottled patterns, giving the atmosphere a more visceral feeling and does a great job of placing you there along with Daesu. The film's ""villain"" provides a great contrast to this in the colors of their surroundings and their lifestyle. This gives a reversed role to the typical dark/light stereotypes that villains and heroes are usually labeled with, though using comic book terminology is misplaced in relation to this movie, even though it did actually have those roots. Settings in the movie are entirely mired in sadness and permeate all the characters, save for the villain (and this character again contrasts very readily apparent stereotypes).

The acting matches the setting. Constant sad and miserable undertones mixed in with clearly feigned happiness and even some idealism. Life is clearly a miserable experience in this envisioned world, and the cast portrays this perfectly.

I encourage everyone interested in foreign cinema to watch this film. However, it is not something that should be viewed by someone wishing to be apart of another ""magical happy journey"" film, because this film certainly does not cater to the normal constraints for expectations.",9.0,19 January 2006
"Excellent ending, but the journey suffers","Oldboy follows a fairly standard story structure: The audience is presented with a ""mystery"" which the protagonist must solve. However, while pursuing the mystery, information and characters are gathered which are significant for the ending, when a huge surprise is revealed. Other films that follow this pattern are ""No Way Out"" (1987) and ""The Usual Suspects"" (1995).

The setup for Oldboy is: Dae-su is kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years by an unknown antagonist. On release, he is given some clothes, money, and a mobile phone. He learns that he has five days to discover who his antagonist is, and why he was imprisoned.

Much of the movie is devoted to gathering clues to solve the mystery, and this is the film's weak point. The director, Park Chan-wook, must provide the audience with all of the clues which are important to the ending, without telegraphing the ending. He must also make the search for clues interesting on its own - as if the audience is watching an ordinary mystery film. It is in the latter that Oldboy fails.

The story of Dae-su solving the mystery is not involving. Likewise, the romance that begins between him and a young woman is not developed very well. There is not much sense of character development, and events seem somewhat random. Director Park tries to spice things up with violence and odd behavior by characters, but it is just ""window dressing"".

In some mystery genre films, such as ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941) or ""Lone Star"" (1996), the ""journey"" of solving the mystery is the interesting part of the film. The solution to the mystery is not particularly important, but the journey is entertaining and rewarding.

Not so in Oldboy. I felt bewildered as to what direction the film's events were following, and I was not engaged in the storyline.

A good test that Park should have used in developing the story is: If the ending was removed or changed radically, would the remainder of the story stand on its own merits? Would it engage the audience?

The ending of Oldboy has tremendous impact. It is very well executed, and very intense. It is too bad that the journey to that ending is so weak.

When ""No Way Out"" or ""The Usual Suspects"" ends, the viewer re-evaluates everything he has seen, and sees it all in a very different light. Oldboy's ending does not trigger such a revelation.",5.0,23 March 2005
Better than Kill Bill,"Both speaking about the same general theme, as to say blind vengeance, Old Boy and Kill Bill are quite similar on paper.

But if QT has clearly chosen an esthetical and graphical approach, I think that Chang Wook Park has an even better story to propose and his characters are more presents and alive.

Old Boy has a really great story and deserves a second vision on cinema, since the first time the spectator is too deeply involved in the story. A second vision really enables a take a distance from the ""what is said"", in order to understand the ""how it's made"", which, on the present case, is absolutely fascinating. Various scenes have already entered in the cinema history, but beyond this, it is the general atmosphere that gives the movie his strength and beauty.

A masterpiece.",9.0,1 November 2004
Great film but too much for me to see again,"I have to say this is a great film but I kind of found it a bit too much to take. It was really dark, and made me grimace on some occasions but mostly it was the ending that I found kind of sick. Sick possibly makes it sound worse than it is but I just can't find a better word.

I can't criticise it for that reason but it's something that made me feel unpleasant and uncomfortable to watch.

However, away from that the film was a tremendous achievement. The execution of directing and acting was great and there was just so many twists and turns, it was edge of the seat stuff.

Overall, I recommend watching the film but put it this way I wouldn't want to watch it again.",8.0,3 July 2005

"a twisted, cathartic experience that I absorbed for days afterward","Oldboy reviewed by Sam Osborn

rating: 4 out of 4

To describe Oldboy would be to imagine Franz Kafka's novella The Metamorphosis mixed with Quentin Tarantino's revenge saga Kill Bill and placed in the cities, schoolrooms, and prisons of South Korea. That would give you a vague idea of what this film attempts. Now add elements of thick brutality, sexual torture, bizarre time-jumps and head-spinning revelations, and you may be able to envision the strange and beautiful symphony that is Oldboy.

Oh Dae-Su (Min-sik Choi) wakes up in a room. The window is plastered over with a cheap painting of the countryside, there's a bed, a television, and a small bathroom. Each night, gas is spilled through the crack in his door, Oh Dae-Su passes out and is awakened later with his hair cut. All there is to do is watch TV, beat at the walls with his fists, and chip away at the brick wall. Dae-su is imprisoned in this room eating fried dumplings and being hypnotized into amnesia for fifteen years. All without knowing who has imprisoned him and why they did so. He vows that his only objective when he escapes is to hunt down his keeper and eat him. That's right, eat him. The premise sounds as simplistic as a general revenge thriller but believe me, there is little about Oldboy that could be described as ""simple"".

You'll first notice Director Chan-wook Park's take on his material. Like Kafka did with The Metamorphosis, Park skips interim fluff between important sequences and nearly always just cuts to the chase. Rarely are we faced with a scene that doesn't contain an essential revelation or storyline twist. Each scene is essential in constructing Park's maze-like screenplay and does so with a pace that's unrelenting in its speed. Also, Park loves to confuse reality with dream in Oldboy. Again relating the film to Kafka's novella, Park never really discerns between fact and fiction. Many times we're presented with a scene that seems strictly dream-like (a woman on a train inhabited only by a giant ant), only to have the film carry on in the very reality we previously realized only as imagination. And he never lets us settle with characters we believe to be human. For instance, because Dae-Su's only linguistic interaction for the last fifteen years was with his television, most of his words in the real world come straight from the ""truths"" he heard from the TV. And many of the characters, despite making human mistakes, take vengeance in the most inhuman of ways. Dae-Su's weapon of choice is a hammer for pete's sake!

But much of Oldboy's power comes from its incredible honesty. Park uses his Kafka-esquire plotting to keep us on the edge of our seats, even in the most inhumane of moments. His violence is brutal, his sex is real, and most of all, his taste for revenge is simply palpable. He grips our psyche to mold us to his film's will, drawing us deeper into its convoluted reality and spitting us out when he's all through. It's a twisted, cathartic experience that I absorbed for days afterward. It works on all angles of our cerebral organ, evoking emotions and images that I will not soon forget.",10.0,18 April 2005
Brilliant Film of it's genre!!!!!,"You folks are sad. This is an extreme Asian film. It is part of a genre that goes against Hollywood film making. They are gory, sadistic,and open ended, and if you go in with an European mind set of course you are going to hate it. I have watched film from this genre since it started in 1960's Japan.

OldBoy - Modern Revolution,"This film goes beyond words. If you are the sort of person who enjoys a film that constantly keeps you guessing, keeps you gripped from the first minute to the last, I fully recommend OldBoy.

Imprisoned for reasons he cant explain, Oh Dae-Su finds himself wondering if and when he will be released. When the day finally comes all he has is wit, some cash and a mobile phone. He then has five days to find his tormentor if he has any hope of explaining his own personal mystery, and that of others involved in his life before and after imprisonment. Slowly unveiled is a myriad of complex links between various other characters from his life, and he has to make the link between them all.

OldBoy is a truly deserving, multi-award winning film that I guarantee is unlike anything else you have ever seen. Watch this film with an open mind and be bound by the same mysteries that face Oh Dae-Su as he struggles to find answers. Trust me, you will not regret seeing this film in the slightest.",9.0,14 March 2005
Artistic violence,"OLDBOY is a movie that comes around perhaps only every several years. The second installment of the ""Vengeance Trilogy"" following the well done Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, the result is a supreme advancement over the previous effort. Visually, it will leave you floored. Personally, it will leave you devastated. Based on interviews I've seen of Chanwook Park, this was his intention; to create a film mentally, physically and emotionally exhausting. I can honestly say he achieved this on all levels and then some by making something richly philosophical.

Min-sik Choi gives the performance of the year and potentially his career. As Oh Dae-su, he undergoes a transformation of at least three different personas, performed almost all of his own stunts and otherwise poured his heart into the movie.

Forget the naysayers, OLDBOY constitutes what original cinema means. Well deserving of its place on the IMDb Top 250.",10.0,13 November 2006
OldBoy is great,,9.0,1 April 2005
"A great plot, maybe a little violent","I saw this film and I liked it much. I found the plot just great, well devised and quite mysterious. The tangled plot makes the viewer feel confused about the story, because he can't guess what's going on for great part of the film. Furthermore there are some crucial objects, like the purple box, that enrich OLDBOY's mysterious atmosphere (it's not a case that some limited edition of the DVD were published in the ""purple box"").

Apart from the plot, I really appreciated its photography and camera work, I think it is really good, and it makes the movie convoy its meaning easier.

I just heard of a remake in future years, I hope it'll be as good as the original, even if I can't believe that there's a living actor who would make better than Choi Min Sik in the same movie.

modern masterpiece!,"Oldboy is the second film in Chan-wook Park's revenge trilogy. The films are unrelated, but all share a common link in the plot.

Because Oldboy is about revenge. unknown revenge...

the main character is taken into captivity by an unknown villain for 15 years. that is the plot description the back cover gives you. and it is great that is so ambiguous. Because when I watched it for the first time half a year ago I was stunned and mortified by the plot and its twists. It is impossible to say too much without letting the goods spill, so I wont.

But this film doesn't only sprout a grand plot, it also carries it self with great style! the colour tweaks done in RGB are quite subtle, but they add immensely to the atmosphere. the atmosphere clearly states that this is a serious movie. the main character is confused and angry, barley away from hateful.

The film only builds this atmosphere deeper and deeper the further the movie progresses. it is violent, yes. but all the violence is done in such a fashion that you feel the need for it. it is very emotionally strong violence. And in the midst of all this Chan-wook Park finds the space for some dark(as it can be) humour. but the great thing is that the humour only adds to the depth of the characters and strenghten the plot, making it very plausible and extremely believable.

To summarize: this movie is not for the faint hearted. the subject at hand is more or less one of the final taboos in this liberal world(next to farming babies for the black organ market)...

Strong, sad and ultimately stunning film for the mature minded",10.0,3 March 2006
Almost perfect,"To me, because I was fore-warned that there is a big twisted ending by some douchebag, well the same douche that recommended me to watch so I guess half a douche? So I saw that plot a mile away. Which kill the surprise. There are entirely too many sign of it along the way, even though admittedly director tried to hide it and did a pretty job at it.

Action sequence was disappointing. It's like he got this ability of been a good fighter, but used none of it. I guess the argument is it doesn't help with the plot. But I just wish to have seen a bit more action in this.

****** Spoiler alert *********

I've a lot of interest in that prison system. Why are rest of them locked up for? You don't have that many solitary prisoner without some crazy story before, during and after the imprisonment!!

It would've been way cooler if the penthouse elevator door closed and room became another prison with that background sound play non-stop forever, until the guy kill himself (probably take all but 15 seconds)

The bad guy shot himself, which was another let-down. Sick bastard like that should've waited until the guy go crazy in that room and kill himself before the end.",9.0,26 July 2014
A smashing movie that will leave you dazzled,"Being a gripping, thrilling and harrowing tale of revenge, Oldboy attacks the audience with its unsettling atmosphere and graphic scenes of brutality. From the very first minutes the film successfully grasps one's attention and doesn't stop to astound until the final, shocking moments. It's an intriguing, mysterious, and bloody seductive movie, which presents a story so gruesome and unforgiving that it's almost unbearable to watch.

When Oh Dae-su is imprisoned for 15 years for unknown reasons and eventually gets out, he has only two questions in mind: why and who? While trying to capture his oppressors he wants to uncover the real purpose behind this outrageous event that ruined his life for good. With the help of a lovely young girl, he succumbs to the lone warrior's way and finds out more about himself and his life than he intended to.

In the film the revenge goes both ways, and as soon as we discover what the whole story is about we won't be able to forget how powerful and, at the same time, discomforting the film really is.

Chan Wook Park did an amazing job directing the film, but probably his greatest decision was casting the superb Min-sik Choi in the titular role. His frighteningly beastly attitude serves everyone right, as he defeats his enemy with cold blood and uncovers all the clues one after another, only to arrive at a conclusion that has much to do with a forgotten past.

Excellent Movie!,,9.0,12 February 2006
Clever and original piece of movie making,A guy is kidnapped and prisoned for 15 years. He doesn't know why he was prisoned. Then he is released and is hungry for revenge. That's the basic plot of this movie. The story is great with many clever twists and turns. Sometimes the movie was a bit confusing but there is nothing too complicated. The movie was also a bit violent and included few realistic but cool fighting scenes although it's by no means an action movie. Hollywood is remaking this movie for the year 2006 and I think if someone like David Fincher directs and we add some great actors to the soup it could be even better for me at least. Not to say things were bad here. Just with a even bigger budget and things I can see this movie being even better if they don't change wrong things. They could sharpen the edges of this diamond.,8.0,19 January 2006
Just awful. Who thinks up a story like this?,"Tonight I worked out while in front of the TV watching Oldboy. If you've thought of watching it, DON'T - be warned. It was recommended to me by a friend and was ranked in the top 250 movies of all time on IMDb, so I decided it was time to watch it.

HOLY CRAP did it leave a bad taste in my mouth. It started amazing, the cinematography and music were incredible, I couldn't turn away (which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 1)... but it took a VERY DARK and disturbing descent at the end, (mind you, it was pretty dark throughout) and I truly regret having seen it.

I wish I'd have read this review first from another IMDb user, it sums it up pretty well: ""A good plot twist should leave the viewer going ""wow, why didn't I think of that?"" not ""OMG what kind of sick %#@$% would even begin to think that?""

excellent film,"This is a marvelous film, although sometimes unbearably cruel. The two characteristic points of the film that impressed me were: 1) The effect of the unexpected. We watch a man dreaming of vengeance, and organizing it, and finally we find out that he himself is the target of a vengeance. 2) The exaltation of the feeling of love. This exaltation is hardly convincing in ordinary heterosexual love. It reminds me of the love stories of Marques, in stories like ""Del amor y otros demonios"", ""mis tristes putas"", ""Madam Butterfly"" of Henry David Hwank, and ""Mary's dog"" of Andreas Mitsou, a Greek writer. Here we see the incestuous love sanctified, the love between a brother and sister, and the love between a father and a daughter. The pursue of vengeance is what magnifies this feeling of incestuous love, always condemned by society, which leads the girl to suicide and the man to self- mutilation in an attempt to avoid the revelation. The act of forgiveness makes the story evade the typicality of an ordinary vengeance plot.",9.0,4 February 2006

"Visually stunning, no doubt about that, but....","Many things have been written about this Korean movie, both praising it and bashing it. I just watched it for the first time and found a movie that, even when it's not perfect, it's definitely worth a look, at least so one can make an opinion about it.

The plot is well known these days, a man is locked in an apartment for 15 years, and has 5 days to get his revenge. Very simple, and very complex at the same time. What has this man done to be locked like that? Why is he released after 15 years? and why doe she have the chance to get a revenge? These questions are what drives the main character, Oh-Dae-Su, and the questions that keep the suspense among the audience.

Adapted from a Manga(Japanese comic), the film's beautiful camera work and outstanding direction really create a visually stunning piece of art. There are scenes full of surrealism that really display a visual poetry and flow like water, thanks to a near-perfect edition. The infamous corridor scene must be seen to be believed.

The acting is for the most part good, and we really feel for Dae-Su, who is some sort of bizarre Count of Montecristo. We go from this regular guy who after 15 years of torture turns into a subhuman being, a monster as he calls himself, a pawn in a game that he doesn't know. It's a very Kafkian feeling.

The main criticism to the film goes to the way the script is developed. It's not really a bad script, but the story unfolds in a way that leaves the audience unsatisfied. I won't spoil a thing, but it has to do with the fact that one ends up wondering if the revenge had any sense.

Personally, I'm not sure if the cultural differences are responsible of this, but I felt that when the motif of Dae-Su's 15 year torture is revealed, the movie loses steam and wraps up the wrong way. Maybe it's because western audiences are used to a more active attitude towards revenge, but somehow it doesn't live up to the expectation. As I wrote above, one ends feeling that everything had no sense at all.

Nevertheless, and putting that aside, ""Oldboy"" is still a movie worth a view, if only for the astounding camera work and the solid direction. Watch it with an open mind and make your own opinion of it.

Solid 7.5/10",9.0,25 November 2005
Oh Dae-Su is my favorite hero...,"After watching this movie, I felt out jumping out the window and hurt some random people with a steel hammer, just because of sheer excitement.

I can't say that I have ever had that feeling before, and I don't mean that in any negative way(except for does who were to get hit by my mighty steel hammer). Oldboy is extreme, provoking and over the top. It's a typical revenge story, but it just gets so much more under your skin, than something like Kill Bill.

Even if you're one of does people who don't like foreign movies, you shouldn't pass the chance of seeing Oldboy. It does something that Hollywood wouldn't dare in ten million years. No matter who you are, I guarantee you, that you will at the very worst, have absolutely appreciated, having had the chance to see this unique movie.

"Such promise, let down by a poor ending","I felt compelled to write a quick criticism of a film which I enjoyed, but was nevertheless disappointed with. This film held some superb acting and some superb dialogue, however it was marred by a frankly pathetic ending (the last 20 minutes were without structure or directorial construct) and some cringeworthy writing. I am a great fan or Korean cinema, however I also understand that not all writing need be in a faux-haiku style. Though much must be lost in translation, there are metaphors, similies and general speeches which make little or no sense, hugely detracting from the atmosphere of the piece.

Other than these critisisms, the film was overall a very good watch. How it has achieved an 8.2 rating I do not know, however to each their own. I was disappointed with what seemed like a hugely sold-out, Hollywood-ised twist at the end of the film; a structure which is no longer shocking or surprising, and which detracted from an otherwise atmospheric and effective piece of film-making.

Secondly, the PAIN. The physical pain wasn't nearly as bad as I expected, but the psychological torture was beyond anything I've seen before. Imagine the strength of sledgehammers, and then imagine the same amount of strength toying with your head. That's why the peak of psychological abuse was a tad more than I could bare.

The photography is superb, the editing and pacing keep the viewers glued to their sits for the entire 120 minutes. And the plot itself, is an unequaled wonder. It's a Greek tragedy (or a Shakespearian tragedy if you will) set in our modern world, and yet it always looks real, much of it is due to the breathtaking performance of the cast, but they could never do it if the plot wasn't there to carry them through.

The plot is utterly unique: Seoul businessman Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi), is kidnapped one rainy evening by parties unknown. He awakens in a seedy motel room – complete with hideously tacky wallpaper, threadbare carpet, a double bed, and a television – but in reality, it serves as a cell. Days, months, and years go by with no explanation given for his incarceration. A daily meal comes through a tiny slot in the door, and every so often sleeping gas seeps in as well. From the television in his room, he learns that he is the prime suspect for the murder of his wife –- and now, even if he escapes, he's a wanted man.

Fifteen years later, Dae-su awakes one day on a grass-covered roof of a downtown building in Seoul, outfitted with a finely tailored suit, a cell phone, and a wallet stuffed with cash. Before Dae-su can begin a new life, he must answer several key questions about his imprisonment. Only after he has these answers can he exact his revenge and turn the page. Meanwhile, his captor decides to turn Dae-su's quest for answers into a cruel, exhausting game that will push him to his limits. Additionally, he has just five days to not to only find out why he was held captive, but to also identify his tormentor, and seek his revenge.

The committed performance by Min-sik Choi strikes a genuinely tragic note amid the mayhem and cartoonish excesses of violence. He does a marvelous job walking on the edge of insanity, while retaining likability and compassion from the audience. Superlative acting across the board, and a pulsating score to compliment the arresting imagery, while the true astuteness of the script will reward only on further viewings.

""Oldboy"" has a wild, twisty storyline on such an epic scale emotionally, and it rarely slows down to consider the logic of some of its most outrageous plot contortions. The revelation in the third act is a bit of a letdown considering the thrilling, ambitious set up. Cinematic in the extreme, the movie has an emotional core that will leave some viewers stunned, yet others disgusted. As tough as it is to endure -- it is brutal, yet brilliant -- and it is undoubtedly a work of art.

""Oldboy"" is the second installment of The Vengeance Trilogy, directed by Chan-wook Park, preceded by ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" (2002) and followed by ""Lady Vengeance"" (2005).",9.0,5 October 2013

Film At Its' Finest,"I am astonished at the comment that I read before this one, which has definitely lead me to defend this truly amazing bit of movie history.

At the place of my employment, I was privilege with free film tickets to go see the Canadian theatrical release of ""Old Boy"". Unfortunately, I saw it without the ability to read the subtitles due to my lame eyesight, but this did not take anything from the film away. Being forced to rely on visuals to understand, I was thoroughly pleased.

""Old Boy"" is visually astounding. Cinemaphotography at its' absolute finest. With excellent attention to detail and beautifully rendered music, words alone are not needed to enjoy this embracing tale of the impeccable Oh Dae Su and his quest for revenge.

Just recently I have had the opportunity to view this movie with subtitles with its DVD release, and I must say I am pleased. I was just as shocked and impressed the second time as the first, and I know I will continue the feeling onto the 5th and 6th times as well. This will be a movie I will be able to watch again and again.

Coming away from this movie I am left with a sense of despair that American filmmakers just have NOT been able to produce anything of this stature since Forrest Gump. I am learning more and more that pure, untainted and amazing film is hidden within Asian movies, and I now continuously chose Asian movies over Hollywood junk.

If you have a good stomach, appreciate forgien films and are really looking for something to keep you on the edge of your seat emotionally, this is definitely for you.",10.0,15 January 2006

thought provoking and deeply disturbing at the same time.,"When I first heard of this movie I was rather dismissive about it but what a mistake that would have been had I choose not to see it. The lead protagonist is kidnapped on his daughters 3rd birthday and imprisoned for 15 years in a room in the guise of a sleazy motel room without any explanation. After being driven mad from solitude he's released into a world he no longer knows to uncover why he was imprisoned and for what ends would he go for the sake of vengeance?

But the bigger question soon becomes can this rabid dog escape his lease and return to the man he once was?

It is an interesting piece; a excellent film on the dysfunction that is rapidly becoming human existence and proving all is never black and white. If you want to see a truly twisted tale check this out if nothing else it delivers and keeps you hooked wondering what next?",9.0,16 July 2005
Brilliant made cinema.,"Jeez, everyone seems to giving this film so flack! I have just watched it again after buying it on DVD, and I enjoyed it more and appreciated the film a lot more than the first time round.

It is visually stunning, the camera work and scenery, spot on in my book and suits the films grittyness. The acting is perfect and the characters are interesting to watch.

Comments on the violence, first of all people saying that this films violence is unrealistic, eh? He gets the crap beaten out of him, he doesn't jus beat up ""a million guys with no problem"" like a zillion Hollywood films I could name, and we don't have the over the top sound effects when fighting, its realistic and the teeth scene made me cringe slightly, and I've seen some violent films in my time.

The story, which I won't spoil is a good twist! It made me surprised and I enjoyed/was disgusted at the turn of events! I highly recommend this to open minded film viewers as it is a great piece of foreign cinema.",8.0,21 October 2005

A Very Different Movie,"This Movie has a very Dark and Different theme than most other movies, One has to watch the whole movie to understand what is actually happening. The story makes no sense to some people and may even be Repugnant and meaningless as it looks very absurd why a person is locked up for 14 years and then he is in this endless quest for finding his Vermin etc etc. What I feel deserves praise in this movie is a very realistic portrait of an Average Korean man who turns into this person who has been framed of killing his own wife and has lost everything for a reason he does not know. The answers are there at the end of the movie. A very natural and good performance by the character playing Oh Dae-Su. Direction is quite slick but has many small flaws like the Man whose teeth are pulled out and he gets replacement Gold Teeth in a day or so (instead of 2 to 3 months) , which is humanly impossible. I have seen remakes of this movie and now realise that Old Boy is pretty well made.",10.0,24 January 2006

O -Dae Su is imprisoned for 15 years and given 5 days to seek the truth.,"Like most English speaking movie goers, I had my doubts when going to see the Korean film Oldboy. Thankfully my faith payed off because the film I saw was mind-blowing. Within the first 10-15 minutes it became obvious that this was the work off an incredible director, Park Chan-Wook, reason being the look of the film is a cross between Se7en and Lost in Translation, which is o bad thing. The basic premise is that the main character, o-dae su, is imprisoned in what looks like a hotel room for 15 years without any explanation by an unknown enemy. He is then released without warning and given 5 days to seek the truth as to why he was imprisoned and who the culprit is. What follows is a bloody trail of destruction that o-dae su walks along. I have to say that it is so refreshing to have a film that pulls no punches, both with the graphic violence and the final revelation. When analysing the direction, parallels are drawn with masters such as David Fincher and it is without doubt that chan-wook will make many more excellent films. The pulsating score gives the movie pace and the acting by the leading man, Choi Min-Sik, is subtle in places and the polar opposite in others but always believable. Likewise, the love interest is a character that avoids the usual cliché's and she is depicted as a kind but lonely girl. To sum up, I have to recommend this film to anyone with an open mind and I would ask vegetarians to avoid it like the plague. Don't say I didn't warn you!",9.0,10 April 2005
Great movie even though i had seen the Hindi remake (zinda) i thoroughly enjoyed this film.,"I admit after seeing the Hindi remake of this film (Zinda) i went into this movie expecting the world, shockingly so this movie actually lived up to almost all its expectations.

I thought that the concepts in the Hindi movie were hard hitting but these movie is gut wrenching, squirming, mind bending etc etc all in one.

I always suspected the end but when it actually happened, i was shocked and still stomach churned. It makes Hollywood revenge flicks look like children's play games.

The acting, music and film-work was top notch. The movie really is a cinematic masterpiece and the only reason why is not rated higher by me is because i still prefer the masala (spice) variety of films and i definitely had hoped for a lot more stylish hard hitting action from this film.

Also i would have liked the confrontation in the end between the 2 protagonists to have been different but the way it is also adds to the beauty of this film.

All in all a great film, but i could have done with a little more action. Please watch this movie.",8.0,14 March 2006

Combination of Tarantino & Kubrick,"I enjoyed this movie for two reasons... It has a taste of Tarantino, and a taste of Kubrik! A Tarantino theme as far as directing is concerned, and Kubric as far as the story and the feeling of the movie is concerned (relating to clockwork orange)! Acting is good, and to my surprise, there were not many fight scenes, like most Asian movies! Screenplay is deep, though a bit confusing in some parts, but maybe it was just me Another good part is that the story kept me wondering till the last minute, and that is always good for a movie that lasts 120 minutes!

Reading some other reviews and comments, people complained about the language, and the subtitles! Well subtitles were fine in Greek, and the language, you just get used to it after some minutes! SO, don't waste your chance of seeing this movie cause of that reason!

so, i gave it a 9/10, as 10 goes to my all time favorites sin city, Donnie Darko, and pulp fiction! Cheers",9.0,21 January 2006

Oldboy - the truth,,2.0,15 July 2020
A difficult but beautiful revenge-powered mystery that can't be passed up,"It's amazing how incredibly well-made movies like ""Oldboy"" manage to slip under the radar, at least in America. It may be a South Korean film, but it appeared at Sundance and its plot and style are easily catered to a Western audience. Regardless what happened, ""Oldboy"" is a film that can't be missed. It is a crime thriller and mystery that is delivered with such force and style that you can't help but be wowed.

The movie is sort of like a much more contemporary spin on Alexandre Dumas' ""The Count of Monte Cristo."" Oh Dae-sue is kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years then suddenly released. Naturally, Dae-sue seeks answers and more importantly, revenge against his captor, but there's more to his situation than he realizes and he will soon find that the outside world is a giant prison in its own right.

Chan-wook Park directs and writes the film based on a comic by Nobuaki Minegishi. That's a good place to start. Both the writing and directing is absolutely fantastic. There is a strong mix of active dialog and reflective narration from Dae-sue's perspective. The transitions between present action and past memory are not only creative but clear and seamless. While the film's only weakness is that it's difficult to follow and understand as it moves at mind- pounding speed, what you can follow is quite a lot considering the film's complexity and how little detail we know through so much of the movie. Nothing starts to really make sense until maybe halfway through.

Park is also incredibly creative. The two-dimensional (like an old video game) fight sequence where Dae-sue takes out some guys with a hammer is unforgettable. His transitions to past memories that combine footage of the previous and upcoming scenes are quite smooth and interesting. One critical flashback, that (without spoilers) involves a hand-held mirror is elegant and powerful. So many amazing choices are made and they're not just good, they're highly memorable.

Min Sik-Choi, who plays Dae-sue, gives an astounding performance, taking us into the tortured, vengeful and penitent heart of Dae-sue. There are times where he's comedic and times here's pitifully comedic. A lot of the film rides on feeling that emotion, feeling his motivation as if it's part of our own.

This is without question a difficult film. Torturing images, incest, scenes that will nearly scar you litter this film. It is its greatest strength at times but obviously it makes it very difficult for some people to tolerate. Also littering the film, however, are quotes and phrases that gain meaning as the film progresses that are beautiful and thought-provoking. No matter the scene, ""Oldboy"" will grip you and make you think long and hard about it as the credits roll.",9.0,14 January 2009

It's not even particularly gory, but it's so inventively sadistic that it brings psychological torment to a whole new level. Most of the credit belongs to Park Chan-wook as I've heard many of the worst implications in the film aren't even present in the source manga. He approaches the depravity with an artistic flair though, bringing life to this seedy underworld through a keen eye for colour and set composition. It just hooks you into it's mystery right out of the gate, keeping you intrigued in watching it unravel, glued to every new development until the final shocking reveal.",9.0,7 October 2022

Beautiful piece of foreign cinema,"It's not often that a thoroughly foreign film is a hit on the Western market. Most of the times, they are loved by a very specific and small community, but not by the general public, who find it hard to relate to the differences to Western cinema. This is not the case for Oldboy.

The story is absurd, but at the heart is the classic ""journey of the hero"" as Joseph Campbell described it. It's classic Greek drama, told in a unique Korean style. Because of this it is easy to relate to the story even though it is foreign.

Our main character Oh Dae-su provides the audience with a solid anchor point in the absurd story he is caught in. Despite all of the things he faces, he remains solid, which is very important because it can be hard to stick with a story that is very weird. There's a point where the story gets so weird that the audience will disengage, but thankfully this movie does not reach that point, in my opinion.

The movie contains many fighting scenes, but does not sacrifice substance for these. It does not devolve into a mindless fighting movie, how enjoyable they can be. It shows these scenes while also displaying many emotional moments which really help the audience find compassion for Oh Dae-su, and help keep them engaged.

Rips Out & Lays The Depth Of Human Nature In Front Of You. ♦ 87%,"Perhaps, this is one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. That is because its climax is the single factor why it is such great cinema.

Talking about a well-planned kidnap with a single purpose, the actors in here portray their respective roles so finely, you get absorbed into the plot. Not to mention the versatile way of narrative & screenplay. I am baffled by the camera work & editing. But, music is the best part of this mystery thriller as it goes low & high in accordance to the scene i.e. brutal or calm. Fantastic!

So brutal & genuine & wild it has its elements described as, the story will blow your mind. Some scenes do induce ennui but in a later sequence you will realize why that was placed there. Bravo!

BOTTOM LINE: It has to be watched to feel the rawness of human nature. A huge 8.7 out of 10 for this South-Korean masterpiece. Highly Recommended!

1000000 Stars,"Oldboy is my favorite movie of all time. I don't know why I haven't written a review yet. I am a huge horror and thriller fan, and the first time I watched it was probably when I was in my 20's. I remember it made an impression on me, but for some reason when it popped up in my feed on Shudder a few years ago I couldn't remember the details. So I rewatched it then - I guess it was when I was like 40, and it completely blew me away like nothing I had ever seen before. The entire movie was a huge adrenaline rush and the ending was like skydiving. I don't think I've ever literally been out of breath from watching a movie before, and I think I just stared at the screen for like 10 minutes.

I have been affected by films before. I tend to lean towards those that are disturbing and evoke deep emotions. Some other films that have affected me, for example would be Martyrs (French), Audition, Antichrist, Funny Games and a few more. I find myself trying to chase the feeling I get from these films without overdoing it and really traumatizing myself.

Oldboy delivered on all of this plus had this dark comedy/satire that just punched. I also tend to prefer foreign films in general, especially Korean and Japanese.

I have not experienced that head rush again since (like I said the closest were the others I mentioned). Oldboy is just like the perfect movie. Chef's kiss***",10.0,8 January 2024

Great performances, great cinematography, this is just a great movie overall. A little dark, definitely not too dark for my taste.

Also, it's pretty consistent throughout the entire running time. There are no ups and downs when it comes to this movie, not a dull moment. The ending was AMAZING. Bottom line is: watch this movie, you won't regret it.",9.0,15 October 2014

Video that doesn't get the respect it so easily deserves,"Any person who cannot handle a few scenes of violence, animal cruelty *overstatement*, and a little incest none of which is very graphic are the ones who do not appreciate this film for what it is. You have to look into the complex structure of the movie, including the precise camera angles, emotional distress of the main characters, and a wonderfully place soundtrack.

The ending is outstanding, and anyone who didn't get premise of the movie refused to give ""Oldboy"" the attention it deserves. Everything is done so well, even the order of events leading to the shocking end which has several twists and turns along the way. Yet, as in every drama/thriller there are a few plot holes.. Ones the general public shouldn't even be able to comprehend unless they have seen the movie several times or have some historical knowledge. All in all, a wonderful film created for people who can look deeper than the gore and immerse themselves in the pain.",8.0,12 February 2011
A violence fest made valid by a remarkable psychological depth,"It's not often films stand out and excel on the basis of narrative structure, but the 2003 South Korean power-house Oldboy is one such example. This is a film that wriggles along like a species you probably haven't seen before, and it does so with an unusual and unnerving combination of grace and brutality. Without disclosing much of the idiosyncratic plot, let's just say the story contains most everything you'll ever want to know about humanity's dark sides - all of which are presented in chilling waves and with quite a bit of artistic merit by director Park Chan-wook, whose compositions, transitions, cuts and imagery give the thematic controversy an attractive filmatic foundation. Oldboy is a violence fest made valid and interesting by the remarkable psychological depth it covers.",8.0,17 October 2023
Amazing movie.,"This was a movie that was virtually unknown over here in the West. Sure some people saw it, said how great it was, but it took a while before it had garnered enough attention to get a release. And when it did it's popularity just exploded.

The story deals with an drunken man who one day, for no reason we know, is captured and imprisoned for fifteen years in a small room. He's fed, he has a TV and a shower, occasionally he'd doused with sleepy gas but neither he or we as the audience know why.

Then one day he's hypnotized, set free again with no knowledge of what transpired or why and it's now time for him to find the people responsible for his imprisonment and exact his revenge. But the people responsible for this are still out there and they're still gunning for him.

There's some amazing fight scenes. Some gorgeous camera work by the director. And a very tightly written story that once it gets going it just doesn't let you go.

Highly recommended for fans of action, psychological thrillers or just Asian cinema. I'd also recommend seeing the subbed version. The dub takes away from some of the emotion.",9.0,3 June 2019
Definitely 1 of My Top 10 Movies! Simply Magnificent!,"I decided to watch this movie after checking the reviews & I was totally blown away. My eyes were glued to the screen from beginning to end. Before this, I never thought Korean movies could be so good. I started to pay a lot of attention to movies from Korea especially from Park Chan Wook. There are still a lot of good movies from Korea like Sympathy from Lady Vengeance, Sympathy from Mr. Vengeange, Thirst (all Park Chan Wook's movies), Memories of Murder, The Chaser, Mother, My Sassy Girl, The Host & etc but Oldboy remains as my favourite.

I don't want to spoil this movie for you but in a nutshell, it is about a man trying to find out the person responsible for imprisoning him in a private jail for 15 years. Great acting from all the cast especially Choi Min Sik. I would like to see him in Hollywood one day.

Once again, if you haven't watched this movie, do not hesitate & go watch it (it is No. 113 on IMDb best movies). However some scenes might be too gruesome for some viewers (not nearly as gruesome as Saw or Hostel in my opinion). Those faint hearted could find out & skip those scenes especially one towards the end of the movie. It is too good a movie not to watch.",10.0,20 July 2010
Wonderfull,"Complicated, violent and full of meaning film, every scene and every little thing is built to put the viewer in difficulty, especially the ending is hallucinating and makes the whole film extremely uncomfortable. In general, the film is very entertaining thanks above all to the action scenes and the very confusing but linear narration, even if it can be a bit out of tune the fact that there are very few lines and very few spoken parts. The plot is very particular and truly original and is made on purpose to make the viewer uncomfortable. Despite the originality, the plot still has some inconsistencies that appear as ugly dirt spots on a beautiful white film.",9.0,16 October 2022
Oldboy movie review,"The Korean easily operates with the ""historical"" names of Hitchcock, Aldrich, Tarkovsky as well as with the ""current"" ones - Kaurismäki, Fincher, Blier. Although his film is based on the manga comics of the purely Oriental man Tsutia Garon, it refers to ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" and the fifteen years in the dungeon are marked by TV newsreels about the fall of the Berlin Wall, Britain's rejection of Hong Kong, the world boxing championships. At the same time, they are marked by the purely Oriental logic of making annual notches by tattooing one's own hand. A Westerner would put them on the wall. In the soundtrack, a European almost vintage waltz is assembled with Eastern-generated techno music. ""Oldboy"" may be the first example of such a loose orientation in all of world culture for a purely individual, private showdown on a single issue. ""Revenge and what to eat it with."" With octopuses.",8.0,19 January 2022
This Movie didn't need a Reboot,"Several Years after watching this movie and being really impressed with the tough story line mixed with the wicked philosophic sarcasm. With this movie the Korean film makers prove that they can make movie's that match the quality of the western counterparts.

I came across a western reboot of the film. Although the reboot wouldn't be that bad if it were an original, it clearly lacked everything that made original so perfect. It showed absolutely no dark humor, the new story line was a little less cunning and they seemed to have no budget to match the CGI effects the original had. If you wan't to watch old boy, make sure it's this version.",9.0,16 March 2015

Ideal foreign cinema,"Oldboy is ideal foreign cinema. Its structure is familiar, but its creativity is transformative. Generally, American films aren't brave enough to highlight taboo topics, conclude ambiguously, or get surreal. Because Oldboy dares to go there, it's a blast of fresh air. Its premise is strange and captivating: a man is mysteriously imprisoned in a motel-like room for fifteen years and suddenly released with no clue why. From there, the protagonist searches for answers and revenge. Through this journey, we consider themes of truth, acceptance, and self-fragmentation. Although it's packed with action and mystery, Oldboy is driven by its psychological examinations.

Meanwhile, Oldboy is a technical force. First, its cinematography heightens the visceral atmosphere. Contrast, focus, methodical camerawork, and diverse shots (such as overheads, close-ups, and Dutch angles) contribute to an intense experience. Next, the editing is nonlinear, abstract, and stylized (using techniques like jump cuts, match cuts, and slow-motion to accentuate the action or drama). Plus, there's an iconic fight scene shown in a single, extended shot. Furthermore, the incorporated music adds melancholy juxtaposition, the abstract sound is emotionally impactful, and the special effects are magnifying. Overall, Oldboy is a unified vision that will leave a striking impression.

Writing: 10/10 Direction: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Acting: 10/10 Editing: 10/10 Sound: 9/10 Score/Soundtrack: 9/10 Production Design: 8/10 Casting: 8/10 Effects: 9/10

Also has great editing tricks as well as subtle storytelling and of course.

Amazing,"This is an amazing Korean Mind Trip that was the basis for the Spike Lee film starring Josh Brolin and Elizabeth Olsen. I loved that crazy film, and I love this one too. I saw the remake first so I know the story and the twist in the original, but it did not change my enjoyment of it. It is terrific. Korean cinema, because of films like this, has been dominant for twenty (20) years. I love how Spike Lee used much go the imagery of the original in his version. This is a twisted, sick story that plays out visually and emotionally like a bad dream. My advise to viewers is to see both versions. There is something there for everyone.",8.0,30 December 2023
Outstanding. A Must See!,"Hello From Here - Oldboy is outstanding, absolutely gripping. Do not confuse this with the 2013 English language remake. Although I did like that version it simply can not come close to the psychotic and frenzied cinematography that this original brings. The mesmerising storyline beautifully balances moments of pure tenderness against the crazed violence and eye squinting torture scenes.

Oldboy is superbly pieced together and a masterpiece of foreign language story telling. It effortlessly transcends the boarders of its mother country of origin. Even if you're not a foreign film lover and struggle with subtitled movies, this is an absolute gem and is a must see movie to go on everyone's list! Sit down, strap in and hold on tight! It's a roller coaster ride!",9.0,12 November 2014
Leaves you with a taste for more. Or maybe that's just blood.,"Oldboy is an artfully-done thriller, mixing slickness with directorial lyricism and more than touch of brutality to create a mesmerizing film about revenge, destiny, and closure. Ostensibly, this is another film tackling familiar themes with the predictable sameness. But thanks to the trio of writers' willingness to incorporate twists into the story, director Park Chan-wook mastering elements of intrigue and unsettling fright, and cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung's beautifully seamy visuals, the film is one to behold, absorb, and contemplate.

The story revolves around Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), a businessman who is kidnapped the night of his daughter's birthday party in 1988 and trapped in a room that mirrors the likes of a hotel room. His only contact with the outside world is a Television, where he learns of his wife's murder and that he is a prime suspect. Dae-su doesn't know, however, that this room will be his home for the next fifteen years. To pass the time, Dae-su practices boxing, plots revenge against his killers, pens a will of sorts, and attempts to escape by tunneling through the brick wall.

In 2003, he is inexplicably drugged and released in the middle of a grassy field, trapped inside a suitcase, with no explanation of why he was held captive, who held him captive, and why he was randomly released. Dae-su, who no longer has a family or relatives, does the only thing he can do - wander around the streets of South Korea. Soon after his release, he meets a female sushi chef Mi-do (Kang Hye-jung), a gentle, vulnerable woman who feels sorry for Dae-su and his circumstances. The two begin a relationship, despite Dae-su's questionable mental health state, and both try to find the people that imprisoned him for fifteen years.

Park Chan-wook doesn't make us sympathize or even side with Dae-su in any particular way. His camera simply remains on him, allowing us to think of him as a victim or someone who potentially deserved this imprisonment. Regardless, we want to know right off the bat why this is happening because the idea is baffling on many levels. But even with a solid mystery at hand, Chan-wook throws in revenge and romance elements, making Oldboy a pretty complete package in terms of juggling multiple, difficult genres, especially when they all need to work together to create an entire film. Chan-wook devotes enough attention to each element of the story, emphasizing on intrigue and devaluing the unnecessary, and with Chung's cinematography working to elevate the look and tone of the picture, Oldboy is nothing shy of immersing on a story and visual level.

There are issues I take with the story, however. To begin with, we don't get to experience enough of the agony Dae-su does when he's locked in the room for fifteen years. A good chunk of the film (say, maybe thirty minutes or so) should've been devoted to the monotony and hell of living inside a random place, being beaten, repeatedly drugged, and manipulated for no clear reason. Instead, only about fifteen minutes are spent inside that hotel-room and we see fifteen years skate by in montage. Another issue is, by the end, specifically during the final confrontation, the scene includes laughable dialog and one particular instance I simply cannot accept, even considering how desperate the lead character is.

Despite the issues, the inevitable intrigue and mystery set forth by the story itself make the film worth seeing simply on those merits. Thrillers come and go, especially ones that boast nothing more than star-power and droning action sequences. Oldboy, on the contrary, lingers in your system, and since its release in 2003, sent shockwaves around the world, introducing people to Korean cinema more so than any other film from the country. The film is brash, thoughtful, and pleasantly excessive, and leaves one with an appetite for more of the same material. Or maybe that's just blood.

The definitive psychological thriller,"Oldboy. It is almost impossible to talk about this film without spoiling it but I'll try my best not to. Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and placed in a solitary confinement in an unknown prison-like area. He is trapped for 15 years. Isolated. No human contact. All he has is a TV, food brought to him, and a bathroom within in the room. He hasn't a clue why he is trapped. He just is. At one point very early on in the film as he is watching TV, he learns that his wife has been murdered and that he is somehow the prime suspect. After this 15 year period, he is let go and is on a rooftop in the middle of nowhere. Now, his mission is to get revenge, violent, bloody revenge and try to piece together why he was kidnapped. To me, this is the definitive psychological thriller, the entire movie takes you on twists and turns, you have no idea where it might go next, it isn't afraid to get to the darkest place possible, beat you up as the viewer emotionally, and beat up the characters emotionally.

The camera style is completely unique. At times, it'll feel like a guerilla style of filmmaking. And in particular, there is an incredible fight sequence that feels like a 2D style beat-em up video game with how it's shot in what appears to be a single take, it's different, unique, and absolutely incredible. The acting is superb on all fronts, each actor embodies their role, no matter how psychotic things get. The soundtrack is also top notch with a score that certainly fit's the emotional levels on the film. But, most importantly are the twists. This movie takes you for such a ride, one that'll I wish I could experience again with my memory completely wiped because of how good it was. It is in the realm of Fight Club in terms of how great the twists are, if not better.

It hits on a lot of emotional fronts with it's characters. They are deep and sophisticated, even if it takes awhile to get to there emotional core, it is well worth it. The fact is, a man that has been isolated for 15 years is going to have complex emotions, confusion, anger, tension, everything under the sun. And it plays in the favor of the film in nearly everyway, allowing for an extraordinarily memorable and unique character. For some inexplicable reason (not reallyHollywood just wants money), this movie is getting remade (and actually being released in like 3 days as of posting). My suggestion, forget the remake. Just go watch this great Korean film on Netflix right now with subtitles on. There isn't a single reason why this movie needs to be remade. Essentially, stop being lazy and watch some subtitles is what I'm trying to tell you (besides if you completely ignore foreign films, you are missing out). Overall, this movie is a ride, a strange, unique experience that you won't forget soon, it'll stick with you, it gets crazy, psychotic, and hit's the breaking points of a human being.",10.0,23 November 2013

genuine Best Film Ever contender,"This is one of the few films that I have repeat-watched, probably about 5 times now. Saw it again last night after a 5-year gap or so. Still a rare 10-out-of-10. As ever, you must watch with the original audio so you get to appreciate the full range of the actors' performances.

Invariably with films where the plot's development is paramount you're also advised to stop reading even spoiler-free reviews...just go ahead and watch it.

If you are reading on, then I think the best advice for whether you'll like this film is if you have a strong stomach for dark psychology (and occasional graphic violence), and if you do, that you watch oldboy as if it's a pulp fiction comic (as in Breaking Bad, or indeed Pulp Fiction itself). The violence and story development is, at times, unrealistic, but this only makes the experience more beguiling as the character arc of the protagonist is so recognisably human.

Here's why oldboy deserves top marks and a steady place in those 'best film of all time' lists:













It's the very end, the actual final image, that struck the biggest chord with me. It's incredibly nuanced given what went on before...powerful, involving stuff...genuinely makes you think.

This film touches on taboos I don't think any director (well maybe Roman Polanski) would explore in an English speaking film.

Crazy scenes you won't see elsewhere, including a crazy seafood part, trippy flashbacks or dreams, weird Korean stuff we never see, etc. I could write more.

The pacing is very good throughout and it ties in with the story. There are a,few scratch your head what the hell is going on moments, but fear not it all works out.

I love it!,"Oh Dae-Su, the protagonist of Oldboy, is kidnapped on his daughter's birthday and is held captive for fifteen years without knowing the reason. Once he is released suddenly, he embarks on a mission to find his captor and take revenge. Oldboy is a South Korean movie that is regarded as a masterpiece and is considered one of the best revenge-thrillers ever made.

Oldboy is directed by Park Chan-wook and is a part of his Vengeance Trilogy, but it differs from the other two movies in several ways. The film has a lot of unexpected twists and turns, and the violence depicted is intense and graphic. The production design and cinematography are impressive, and the background score is a mix of modern and classic elements.

Choi Min-sik, who portrays Oh Dae-su, delivers an outstanding performance, while Yoo Ji-tae and Kang Haye-jung also give commendable performances.

that was perfect ❤,"Oldboy was my introduction to Korean cinema, and what an introduction it was. Initially it seems to make little sense the first thing we see is a man with a dog leaning backwards over the edge of a tall building another man is holding onto his which prevents from falling, this man says he a story to tell. Then the story begins with the Oh Dae-Su, drunk police station, a friend collects him but while his is making a call in public phone box he vanishes.

A gut wrenching movie like few others.,"There's nothing new I can say about Oldboy that hasn't been said before.

It's fascinating, sad, profound, astoundingly brutal, and just one hell of a final twist that churns your stomach upon its reveal and how the characters respond to it.

I'd say more like middle aged than Old.,"Oldboy (2003) -

It wasn't easy to write a review for this film, because although it really wouldn't be my chosen genre of film or the style of production that I would usually watch and I do struggle with subtitles, I could definitely appreciate and easily see what was good about it and why it has appeared on so many top films lists. Lists that were obviously decided by people with far more qualifications and a better system for scoring than I've got.

Okay, so due to the language barrier I couldn't really tell if it was well delivered or if Mido (Kang Hye-Jeong) was over the top with her performance, but it was a very interesting concept and a deviation from the usual storyline's.

It certainly kept me intrigued and off my phone for a change. Apart from the fact that I had to pay attention because of the subtitles, the story was enough anyway. I needed to know the why's and the what for's of it all, especially because the beginning had given nothing away about why Dae-Su Oh (Choi Min-Sik) found himself in trouble in the first place. He seemed to be really good in his role and I could certainly appreciate his character.

I could also appreciate that the fighting depicted was at least what I would expect to be fairly realistic. By that I mean that although he went up against a lot of adversaries at times, the actual choreography of the fighting was how I could imagine it happening in a real life version of the situation and not all fancy Kung Fu for the sake of it.

I did guess one of the twists quite early on, but I probably wouldn't have done back in 2003, if I'd watched it when it was first released. So many other films have done twists since then, that I have found I constantly expect one and guess at what they might be all the way through watching a film, even when they are the most basic of stories. It appears to be the new normal for everything now and I find that I'm almost disappointed when nothing does happen at the end of 'See Spot Run' for example, but that wasn't the case with this one, which had many twists and definite surprises.

Other than that, some of the editing choices towards the end were a bit old fashioned and in places it was a tad gory for my tastes, but essentially, although it wasn't my type of film, it was all to be expected from the synopsis and it was a very good production. A clever plot, with no performances that stood out as awful and plenty of action to keep most people entertained.

Peep This Reviews,Although I'm not thoroughly familiar with Korean movies. I can safely say this is the best one I've ever seen. The story is engrossing and the action is off the charts.

"Great movie, no matter what.","My opinion on how the plot turned out is ambivalent, it still is an awesome movie worth lots of recognition.

It certainly is not a waste of time in any kind of way to watch ""Oldboy"", like others on IMDb suggested. Quite the opposite - I very much recommend watching it.

The production is great, it really is a pleasure to see what the team working on the movie created here. Some fighting scenes look a bit unrealistic, doesn't matter much though, since they tried something here for dramaturgical purposes. The main title song is emotionally fitting and catchy, the actors have all been casted well and the plot is the most important part of the movie, it really gets your brain juices flowing.

worth watching and thinking,"Frankly speaking, it's a great film, even though the storyline seems absurd, shocking, and against the common social morality. Never gossip others' personal life as long as it wouldn't interfere with our own interests. People should learn to respect and tolerate with each other's social behavior as long as it wouldn't physically hurt anyone and do real harm to the stability of our society. At the very least, if you don't agree with other people's ""bizarre"" but non-harmful behavior, you can simply choose not to socialize with them and let them be. People should never ever publicly expose others' privacy, let alone insulting those who are different from us. Anyway, I think we all can learn a thing or two from this movie, even though most of us might feel extremely uncomfortable with these shocking scenes.",8.0,4 January 2024

One could say that movies must be entertainment and I do agree. But there are entertainment that promote our growth and the ones that promotes nothing or bad feelings.

This movie does not shock to me it sickens an will get forgotten very easily but some bad ""taste"" may rest in some shadow place in our minds making us somewhat used to expect the worse on the next of our kind instead of the reasonable.

To have such a rank seems that our society still needs / likes to see the worst of ourselves.

Finally I may say the movie storie has no positive side at all although the movie making (acting, picturing...) may have many qualities the storie , in my opinion, is something I'd rather had not known or does not agregate to culture or my character.

I Can Guess Why Tarantino Liked It,"I too have seen mention of this film as I've read about Korean cinema and the surreal qualities this one has. While I will never watch it again, it is more of an experience than a film. It is steeped in violence and sickness as this man tries to figure out what happened to him. Once we realize that he was targeted specifically, things get better. Had it been random torture it would have lost its edge. If there is any charm here, it is the selection of a character with few redeeming qualities who, during imprisonment alone for fifteen years, watching television and working out, does begin to reclaim himself. Unfortunately, his past actions are now a mystery to him as he has been hypnotized and manipulated over and over. But his crimes would be unforgivable, if he knew what he was doing. I have a friend who would say, as he did with Taxi Driver, ""This is so sad and so sick; why would someone want to make such a movie?"" That's a question left only for the director.

It's safe to say my view has proudly changed. Where there was apprehension, now there's nothing but unwavering loyalty and respect for these brilliant, Korean film making aficionados. At least the Southern ones. The Northerners still have some redeeming to do, but I fully support and stand behind South Korea, Hyundai, Kia, and this wonderful work of art.

The world doesn't always laugh with you,"Oldboy is certainly one that is full of entertainment and twists. Unbeknownst of the thriller I was about to watch, this film offers an extremely thick but thought-provoking plot. At each step of the story, viewers try to question and seek out answers--only to be one (or several) step(s) behind.

From the introduction, we follow a flamboyant character who's about to endure hardship like no other. Life is not always fair, and that statement is magnified in this tale. Imprisonment, especially without justification, is torture. Not knowing its extent is even worse. With each day no different than the last, time seemingly runs forever, and sanity is in low quantity as time progresses.

Whether we agree or disagree with the antagonist's decisions is one debate (albeit one-sided), but the lesson taught by this extreme example is one that deserves reckoning. From the ""harmless"" teases to the malicious attacks, everything we do has an effect, whether minuscule or grandiose in nature.

Excellent thriller,"One of the best films of 2003, all the way. A tour de force of emotions and very well executed. Its quite brutal and may scare people under 12. However, for people who appreciate films that are not that simple cliché ridden stories here is a fine treat.

The score is also very good, since it contains even a little Vivaldi, which I appreciate in a film. The score is always a vital part of a film and here we are well treated.

Nice,"This is an enthralling cinematic experience that seamlessly weaves together elements to deliver a captivating and memorable journey. From the very beginning, the film grabs the audience's attention with its opening scene, setting the stage for a rollercoaster of emotions.

One of the standout features of this movie is its exceptional storytelling. The narrative unfolds with a perfect balance of suspense, drama, and moments of genuine humor. The screenplay is masterfully crafted, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats while also allowing for moments of reflection and connection with the characters.

The performances are nothing short of outstanding. The cast's chemistry is palpable, and each actor brings depth and authenticity to their respective roles. The characters are well-developed, making it easy for the audience to invest emotionally in their journey. Whether it's the protagonist's journey of self-discovery or the antagonist's compelling motives, every character contributes to the overall richness of the narrative.

Visually, it is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the essence of the story in every frame. The use of cinematographic techniques enhances the overall impact, making it a visual treat for cinephiles. The attention to detail in the set design, costumes, and special effects further elevates the film's production value.

The soundtrack complements the narrative beautifully. The music not only enhances the emotional beats of the story but also becomes an integral part of the overall experience. The well-chosen soundtrack adds another layer to the film's immersive quality.

In terms of direction, it has delivered a tour de force. The pacing is just right, allowing the story to unfold organically without dragging or feeling rushed. The director showcases a keen understanding of the material, bringing their unique vision to the screen and leaving a lasting impression on the audience.

This movie is a testament to the power of cinema to transport viewers to different worlds and evoke a myriad of emotions. Whether you're a fan or simply appreciate a well-crafted and compelling story, this film is sure to leave a lasting impact.

"Visual Masterpiece, Emotionally Incomplete","A film that discusses a vast range of human emotion and moral questions, Oldboy is merely a plot-driven tale of revenge. The film is composed of extremely rich characters of intensely described emotions and personalities played by very apt actors. However, these characters become consumed in a confusing, but well-woven, web of events, flashbacks, and choppy explanations. The depth of these carefully created characters built by Chan-wook Park is hidden by the carefully created story built by the same person.

The subject matter is full of potential no matter how it is presented due to its intensity and brooding venture into the human soul. But the viewer is rendered unable to connect with the plight of the characters due to the several twists and delicate plot points. While the story is solid and unfathomably interesting, it severely detracts from what should be the major point of the film: the exploration of the human soul.

The filming and production of the piece is beautiful. The director carefully builds his story with perfectly inserted flashbacks and David Lynch-style scenes. The acting by the primary cast conveys the emotions of the characters to a fine point. The writing manages to render dialogue for the film that remains realistic, characterizes, and displays emotion, despite the fantastical situation and many variables. The composition accompanying the film is exceptionally brilliant, mixing classical and modern instrumentals together. The music effectively accentuates the intense emotions portrayed in the movie. Additionally, the filming and design creates a beautiful visual experience. Oldboy is a visual masterpiece, like 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), but all of it detracts from the main purpose and raw emotion of the movie.

It's like Memento (2000) on steroids, or Room (2015) with even more intensity. Yet it misses the mark completely. The emotion is felt, and then lost in the confusing whirlwinds of the story. Park throws the viewer into the Land of Oz and is lost wondering where Kansas went. Tears should be shed for the tragedy of Dae-su Oh, but instead tears are wept for the lost potential of this visually perfect, but emotionally incomplete film.",3.0,15 June 2017

The movie kept the plot going on but it wasn't making enough emotional impact on me, and even though some events surprised me I couldn't understand why the characters responded the way they did.

The acting was great, and I can understand why the movie is artistic, but to me it did not reach, it did not leave me with my mouth wide open, the music was bad, the sex scenes were authentic but inconvenient.

Tiresome,"In this short review I not only review the film itself, but also comment on the tiresome cult following that it has acquired over the years.

I gave the movie a 2/10 simply because it is too contrived. It tries too hard to be everything. In its attempt to visit the entire emotional spectrum, it just becomes a mess and a hodgepodge of convoluted events. With all the ""poetic"" story elements and significant moments I just got tired of it all.

I get that the soap opera plot is just there to help put the viewer through that supposedly profound emotional wringer. For me, it was just disappointing. A gauche and ostentatious emotional manipulation that lost its appeal after just a few moments.

Which takes me to my comments the films' predictable and frankly, rather rabid fans. Since the film does have a heavy, clumsy impact, I see why so many are spellbound by it. They're swept up in its maladroit attempt at profundity and can't seem to take a step back and see it for what it is: overrated trash. Instead they think it's one of the best movies ever made and any dissenting opinions are attacked with the vehemence that only unimaginative fans in great numbers can muster up.",2.0,26 April 2014
I don't know what to make of it,"I was reading a book that analyzes violence in movies, and Oldboy was mentioned. Then I also happened to find the movie so I decided to check it out right away.

I didn't like it a lot. I don't know if it's because I don't understand the Korean/Asian movie making because the mood of the film seemed so weird to me. It has a dark and violent story but then it's also comedic, and also has a little bit romance. I don't know what this movie wants to say.

The story was a bit hard to follow, but that may be partly because of the subtitles possibly being not perfect.

"On the verge of greatness, this close","If there's any film I wish I could like, it would be Oldboy. The film has an oppressively unsympathetic tone throughout, its best strength of many. The opening 40 minutes remain some of the best I've seen in cinema. Perfectly paced and doesn't hold back on showing the hellish, uncaring and nihilistic attitude of our main character, Oh Dae Su.

The cinematography is evocative and grimy. The soundtrack is whimsical and creepy and works really well against all the violence and weirdness. Strong direction carries the opening by holding your attention and creating intrigue. Every actor is giving one hundred percent throughout.

So I'm deeply engaged by the time our 'hero' has been established and the story begins. Unfortunately, this is where my interest in the film slowly ends.

Oldboy is dragged down by its need for exposition. It tells a twisting narrative that seems too complex for its own good. It really slows the pace down to a near halt. The iconic hammer hallway fight scene is great in isolation, but lacks tension as it happens way too early, and starts and stops the pace of this film, going back to exposition straight after until the third act.

Without spoiling anything, the villain has a vendetta against Dae Su that involves an elaborate plan, relying on hypnotic suggestion. The (in)famous payoff is shocking - at the cost of creating massive logic and plot holes. Thinking about the villain's plan makes you realise it makes no sense and only happens because the film needs a story. It's a damn shame, because the twist is deeply unsettling. I feel it could have been developed differently, even if it covered up only some of the plot holes. Also, the villain's motivations are pretty weak. It's basically all his fault anyway, which makes it hard to feel understanding for him.

Oldboy is certainly interesting enough for me to write this long review, but I've seen it twice now, and both times I found myself disappointed by the end. It's a shame as it really has some amazing strengths, but it's let down by a confused story that's too focused on the twist to make sense and remain entertaining.

Man did that suck!!!!,"I have been catching up with Korean films since I viewed I SAW THE DEVIL a couple of months ago. That film blew me away. It was a very violent revenge story. The film was uncomfortable to watch but the story was compelling and emotional, not just violent. I had read a lot of great things about OLDBOY. I didn't know much about the plot, but assumed that it would be good from all the great things I read about it.

After seeing this film I really don't get why it got such accolades. The basic outline of the story is that a man is put in an isolated room for 15 years in a cell that looks like a hotel room. He escapes the cell and begins a frantic search for truth and revenge. All of this sounds promising doesn't it? We it starts out very well. But as the film goes along it gets so convoluted and strange that it just lost me. The film stars Choi Min-sik as Oh Dae-su, the man that is imprisoned. When he gets out he is given a cell phone in which he gets a call from his captor. His captor refuses to tell him why he was imprisoned. What follows is a web of violent revenge and deception. His captor wants to make Oh Dae-su suffer. Again, the basic story could have been very involving but this film is done in such a slow meandering and overall weird way that I just didn't care for it. I won't give away much, but this film is so pretentious and self serious for it's own good. The violence in the film is very brutal, but without the emotional connection it just seems gratuitous.

Disappointing,It's a fashionable foreign film. It made some sense to me but too many large portions passed me by. The style of the film was very cool. It was a professional production from beginning to end. It looks like it cost a lot to make. I found it slightly lacking charm and excitement. The downplayed visuals sometimes became boring. All in all I liked the film. I just wish that I understood more of it. It was stylish and well executed. It was sober but also slightly unique. It certainly looked good. It was a disappointingly dull sound mix. It was not very dynamic and lacked enthusiasm; it was too similar to a sound-mix you'd expect in a comedy but disappointing because I expected more. The music was pretty good though. I don't think that I got the story first time round. I watched it again and understood it and I really liked it. The problem was that there were a few plot-holes that made it harder to swallow. It was also a touch long in some places. The ending was good except it could have lost a scene without losing anything. It slightly reminded me of Pulp Fiction (1994). Good fundamental story and great style suffer from disappointing binding elements.,5.0,28 July 2023
The worst and most confusing movie I've ever seen,"As the title already says, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I just can't understand why everyone is so exited about this movie and I don't know if it's just me and the person I've watched it with, but we both didn't understand anything of what was happening. This was genuinely a waste of time. Everything just felt very random. That's all I have to say about this movie.",1.0,23 February 2022

Please don't waste your time,I haven't added any comments on any movies on here since like 3 years ago but this movie was so BAD & AWFUL that i felt its my duty to let everyone know. Its just a cringe- 2hour waste of time cheap Asian movie full of weird incest curveballs. I was looking for a good movie in top250 of imdb and found this at no.70. HOW???? How can a movie this trash deserve the top 250? Stop wasting your time on it specially if your time is limited like me. Now I have to wait for another weekend to watch a movie. Thanks for wasting my time with this bs. I really don't get how people are calling this a masterpiece with reviews of 9 and 10. TRUST ME AND DONT WATCH IT.,1.0,10 March 2024

It was awful in every way.,The funniest movie I've seen in my whole life. It was awful in every way. It's really a shame that anyone would spend time on this movie.

"Again, Asian movies in a different level","I understand that Asian culture has its own rules and laws and the ppl there have their own way of thinking, but really cmon, the movie was just sick, what was this movie even bout, 100 mins of put-up things, the first brief of the movie was good, it was new and odd and let u question why, why did he got locked for 15 years, then it went through a bunch of nonsense character with no background and without any explanation why they got added to the story, then it gets sicker when they explain who are those character and how they got there, and even the way they presented the character wasn't the best, they just had to butt em in, and the number of things that they overexplained cuz they were meaningless and they just needed to stuff it for the sake of making a movie 100 mins long, and the main story actually disgusting distributing that involved child nudes and incest and gore, and that's literally what the story bout, aside of the nonsense that they trying to make around it to come out with the 100 mins, so if u wanna watch some F-up and feel bad for watching a movie to the fullest, i would highly recommend u this one.",1.0,19 March 2024
Confusing most of the time,"I thought this was a cool movie, I enjoyed watching the main character on his adventure of revenge. However, I thought most scenes and plot lines were confusing and out of place. I may understand more on a rewatch, but the first watch was overly confusing. I spent most of my time trying to figure out what was going on. I feel like the story could have been told better, but was still a good concept and a fun watch.",5.0,13 July 2022

"Not as good i thought it would be, not a masterpiece","I so badly wanted this to be that masterpiece that so many talked about. Escpesially with that gorgeous soundtrack and that beautiful filming! But no i cant call this a masterpiece at all. Its exaggarated, over acted and very consfusing put together. It starts out pretty okey, but it quickly loose that red thread and some basic logic aswell.

The manuscrips gets worse and worse and gets abit too ""crazy"" and exaggarated for my taste, just like some Tarantino movies, kinda same vibe of exaggaration.

Overall its on IMDb top 250, worth to watch and give your view to it, but i would really recommend it.",5.0,19 May 2024
Bad beyond belief,"When a movie is so highly rated and you've seen a ton of movies but somehow missed one, it's a must see.

This is a truly pathetic movie in every way. Academy award for most stupid plot, or perhaps non plot. Acting is non existent. Fight scenes are staged like Keystone Cops, and not even as good as a 3rd rate Kung Foo movie with superficial grunting.

Lots of poorly developed themes that don't connect; talking too much, hypnosis, revenge, incest, catharsis.

Not one character is developed, including the protagonist.

The only positive is the dark relatively colorless (with a few key exceptions), scenes setting the morose mood.

Don't bother; nothing to see here folks; everybody go home.",1.0,17 March 2024
The worst movie at all,Oldboy is the worst movie and no doubt about it so much better than that and the other guy that you will have is a great guy to have a great year of family and he loves it so he is so proud of you guys so he will have a good time to be in a great place in a great family of life he will have a good day to do a great day and family and life and he is a good guy but we will be praying for you and your family.,1.0,29 July 2022
Overrated mid movie,"I watched it with the expectation of a classic cinema, and was underwhelmed.

These are the positives: the movie is well-acted. The protagonist is magnetic. The hallway fight sequence and the long flashback sequence are magical. The premise is imaginative and enticing.

But everything else was underwhelming for me. I was not captivated, surprised or even grossed. The famous twist was obvious before it came. I just did not see whatever it was that other people saw in the movie.

Maybe if I felt some way about the antagonist, there is a chance that I would have had a stronger reaction. He just came across as a weird unlikeable psychopath, but not particularly interesting.

Stylistically too, Oldboy was far less interesting than what I had expected. Except a few scenes and sequences here and there, nothing stayed with me.

This feels almost like an exploitation-type movie that could well have been forgotten, but somehow became world famous.",3.0,12 May 2024
Wtf,"Two stars for the cinematography alone.

Other than that the movie is beyond description.

The plot twist is unfortunately both predictable and too far fetched. The plot in general as well, in its effort to achieve originallity and provoke awe and shock, is also lost in absurdity. While I have no doubt that people can go to extremes to get vengeance, this scenario is just over the top, even for a deeply twisted character.

This film is just another classic example of supposedly highly thought provoking cinema when in reality it's just a classic the emperor's new clothes.

If you're into disturbing absurd plots with unnecessary long takes and slow pace, by all means watch this film.

If you're into realistic depictions of emotions such as love, hate and vengeance, do not waste two hours of your life.",2.0,27 January 2024
I love it! But not really...,"The performances are great and the film is technically perfect. The direction is smooth is shot in a really original way. The action scenes are absolutely amazing and the don't look like anything we've seen before. The film has one of my favorite soundtracks of all time and it actually reminds me of ""A Clockwork Orange"".

The problem is that the villain's motivations don't make much sense and the last 30 minutes are annoying, confusing and they are what ruined the movie for me. I said a lot of good things but the bad ones are just too bad.

Really overrated but worth watching",,24 March 2015
The original 'Turkish Plot',"The point that i was able to make out of it despite the cold blooded nature is to live in the moment, to think about the consequences of what we are doing. I know sooo much people that would not be able to watch this right after the first 5 mins, why? because not everybody likes to stop their stream of 'happiness' just to watch the the 'black side of some korean's imagination' anyway now i know where turkish writers get their plot inspirations from.",,19 October 2018
"Laugh, And the World Laughs With You. Weep, And You Weep Alone.","One of the most shocking & disturbing tales of revenge you are ever going to come across, Oldboy is not only a genre-defining classic that sets a new benchmark for revenge-thrillers to follow which as of today still remains unsurpassed, but is also the finest film to come out from the South Korean film industry & in every way is director Park Chan-wook's best work.

Oldboy tells the story of Oh Dae-su, who is abducted on the night of his young daughter's birthday & is held captive in an apartment prison for 15 years, without any clue of why he is there & who has imprisoned him, and is later freed in the same inexplicable manner. Rest of the film is about Oh Dae-su trying to uncover the identity & motives of his captor to exact revenge.

Co-written & directed by Park Chan-wook, Oldboy is the second instalment of his Vengeance trilogy, preceded by Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance & succeeded by Sympathy for Lady Vengeance but apart from the central theme of vengeance, every other aspect of this cinema is different from those two chapters for Oldboy tears through the confinements of its genre unlike anything before & is an exhilarating work of art.

Ingeniously written & directed, Park brilliantly layers the plot with clever twists & unflinching violence that slowly unravels its mysteries to give the viewers a cinematic jolt they'll have a hard time forgetting. The picture is also exquisitely photographed & meticulously captured by its stylish camera-work. Editing steadily paces the narrative & also adds a grim mood that further enhances the film's dark elements.

Production design is stellar work in every manner, visual design is extremely enticing, sound design also plays a relevant role and its background score has a slight retro feel to it plus it happens to be heartwarming & heartbreaking at the same time. And while there are a lot of favourite moments to choose from, my favourite is the single long take of the corridor fight scene which in my opinion is one of 21st century's greatest cinema moments.

Coming to the performances, it's a trio of terrific performances that elevate its premise with most impressive input coming from Choi Min-sik who simply owns his role of Oh Dae-su & overshadows everything else. Next is Yoo Ji-tae giving us a controlled rendition of the guy responsible for Dae-su's imprisonment. And last we have Kang Haye-jung as Mi-do; Dae- su's love interest who plays a vital role in the film's unpredictable & unexpected finale.

On an overall scale, Oldboy is a disturbing, unsettling & violent cinema from South Korea that will traumatize most of its viewers with its harrowing & sickening depiction of revenge but then, there is also no denying that with its remarkable blend of impeccable direction, clever screenplay, arresting photography, tight editing, amazing performances & classic score, it's also one of the greatest films ever made. A haunting masterpiece. One hundred percent recommended.",,11 October 2013
