The premise of the film is about one mans struggle to do the right thing at when everything around him is going wrong. \n\nDon Cheadle is the best African American actor out there. His passion and heart was so strong that moved me almost to tears. There is a definite wish here to let this story to be known to the world. \n\nIts powerful and provocative in its indirect and subtle jabs at the west for not intervening into such a horror that took place in Rwanda.\n\nVery well made and directed. Please see this and let it inspire you as it did me - to try cultivate selfless actions. \n\nThanks, Ricky Thind", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 10}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 373302, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 8.1}, "contentRating": "14", "genre": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "datePublished": "2005-02-04", "keywords": "rwanda,brutality,hatred,mass killing,female rear nudity", "duration": "PT2H1M", "actor": [{"name": "Don Cheadle", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000332/"}, {"name": "Sophie Okonedo", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0645683/"}, {"name": "Joaquin Phoenix", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001618/"}], "director": [{"name": "Terry George", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0313623/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Keir Pearson", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0669311/"}, {"name": "Terry George", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0313623/"}], "political_m": true}
