This is a genuinely good movie, hands down the best movie DC has put out since Nolan's trilogy. The soundtrack is epic, the movie has some ridiculously cool action scenes (there's legit action here, as opposed to the larger-than-life punches that superman has to handle, which don't really affect the story in any way). Margot and the rest of the cast did a great job, and the villains were nuanced, insidious creeps- which made for an excellent movie experience. The best parts were the quietly thoughtful scenes (e.g. where Harley offers Canary a hair tie bang in the middle of a fight sequence!). Movie never gets cheesy (ahem unlike most other DC movies), and there are only 4 protagonists besides harley (so it's nowhere near as cluttered as suicide squad was). It's a gritty, fun movie, and the closest parallel I can get to the MCU is Deadpool (both gory/hilarious).\n",

I think this is the source of most of the hate this movie got because a lot of the negative reviews I have seen bout this movie are complaining about how the men didn't play a bigger role, or they claimed that it was a movie made to hate on men. Both of these claims do not apply to this movie because the men in the movie were not the main characters, so why would they need to play as big of a role as the women, and all because the men weren't front an center doesn't mean that this movie was meant to bash men. This is why I think everyone should watch the movie for themselves, and make their own opinions. Especially, since the negative reviews seem to have a lot of bias due to the mainly female cast. It is kind of like the people who left overly negative reviews wanted to hate the movie before they even watched, so they nitpicked every little thing.\n",

You all may have loved the bs version of \"Infinity War\" but in reality it failed miserable to actually deliver the correct storyline.... When you change the characters and storyline to satisfy a group or groups you kill the actual creation of it.... This movie played out perfectly like a comicbook from the cheesey oneliners to the over the top action sequences.... I loved it from begining to end.... Marget Robbie, is one of the few women in the world whom can actually play Harley Quinn correctly.... Just like Ryan Renolds playing \"Deadpool\".... There are many comicbook movies coming out and the majority of them won't hold true to the characters or the storyline.... If you want to create a comicbook that centers around a set gender, race, sexual preference, etc. then go ahead I am all for it but leave the damn orginal characters and storyline of other comicbooks alone.... And save the bs film school student \"Thesaurus\" comments as this movie was not trying to be, \"Howard fing End\".... It is a comicbook movie not based off a novel....~\n",

It is absolutely amazing, Robbie is a fantastic Harley Quinn, yet again! All the other ladies are exceptional as well and McGregor makes a fantastic bad guy too.

      "Document: Stunning, Campy Fun This film is amazing: an unreliable and trippy romp through Gotham following a deranged yet likable woman who just wants some breakfast. Seeing all the hate reviews here, it's clear so many people just didn't \"get\" it. This movie was made to serve the people, a brutally funny queer- and PoC-centric entry into the Camp/Cult canon, I left the theater feeling empowered and hungry both times I saw it. The stylizing, the pacing, the motifs, the soundtrack, everything in this film is perfection, and I think Cathy Yan is a genius. No, this is not another boring and terrible DC film, and it wasn't meant to be. This film is, truly, \"fantabulous.\"\n",

      "Document title: crash and burn\n",
      "Document: crash and burn I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences. You started well in the beginning but when you lose my interest from the middle of movie then you seem not to care for the movie anymore that you want to see the ending right away. There is no Birds of prey, at least none recognizable from their source material counterparts. A dud from Warner Bros. Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work}, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best.The action was lacking and uninspired as well. It relied way too much on slow-mo fights or just too much going on to really understand it all. You know you have a poorly made fight sequence when they decide to use slow motion on every punch or hit to make it seem cooler than it is. They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU. The story is told out of order, which would work if it had an interesting one. The portrayal of the characters was somewhat adequate. The best thing about suicide squad was Robbie's performance but this vehicle is a disservice to the potential that was there. Robbie does her best but the direction, script and editing are not at the requisite level. An interesting character poorly treated by a very lacklustre script. Disappointing.When a cartoon does better than a multi-million dollar film, you've failed.\n",

How anyone can even cheer for this version of of the man-hating feminist Antifa-inspired Harley Quinn is beyond me.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example - in the first 5 minutes the movie depicts her father as an evil man who dumps her repeatedly and then successfully at an orphanage led by nuns. Obviously anti-Christian Hollyweird has to depict the nuns as evil who spend their days thrashing Harley. She takes revenge by smashing a nun's teeth out with a baseball bat. Nice eh? It gets better. She gets herself a Hyena, but then feeds the Hyena the owner of the exotic pet shop because he dared being a creep to her - the movie shows his body being fed to the hyena - murder is all good if you are a creepy man I guess. Then in a club she breaks a man's legs because he dared to call her a dumb slut. She behaves badly towards both men and women - by the way - her friends are like a radical feminist man-hating Antifa battalion - gulag chapter 4. Oh - and they claim instantly that Harley was the brains behind Joker - patriarchy holding down women 24/7 - pure feminist psycho-dogma.\n",

For the first time, you get to see Harley Quinn's real bat and hammer action with blood. Margot Robbie is such a fine actress, that I believe she was born to play this role. Her performance as a witty action (anti)heroine is nothing but flawless. I really can't wait to see her in this role again, and for now, this film has left me satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Birds of Prey can be compared more with John Wick or The Equalizer instead of Superman or Batman. This is the best female action movie I've seen till date, and I'm not kidding. You get loads of action, a good amount of humor and a ton of memorable characters. I thought Mary Elizabeth Winstead was excellent as the Huntress, and clearly my second favorite after Harley Quinn in this film. Every action film about a team tends to have at least one tough and serious character and Huntress is that. Harley, however, is a mix of both tough and sweet: presented in a way that you just can't hate her. All actors and actresses were truly awesome throughout the film, including Ewan McGregor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The action is the biggest highlight of this film, and is possibly the best action in a DC movie till date. It uses slow-motion and camera angles brilliantly, and its raw nature is the real icing on the cake. If you like action movies based on comic book characters and are an adult, check it out with a tub of popcorn. There's something really charming about the film's visuals, and it actually feels like a comic book has come alive.\n",
      "\n",

This was a bad decision since you can see that the screen writer did not understand the comedic part of Deadpool and could not find the proper lines and scenes to match. Robbie is also awful trying to give a comedic performance - her performance is so bland and lifeless that it is embarrassing. The supporting cast is beyond idiotic. The writer destroyed Huntress and Black Canary and instead of making them nice strong characters she made them a mockery with terrible performances and dialogue. Avoid is garbage at all cost - wipe it off of your windshield for what it really is.\n",

This movie is funny, action-packed, fun, and has a great soundtrack so I don't know where a lot of the negative reviews are coming from. Margot Robbie plays Harley Quinn to a tee and absolutely kills her performance. The supporting cast--Rosie Perez, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, and Ella Jay Basco-- does a great job at bringing to life their powerful characters. I heard a lot of hesitance about this movie stems from the fact that people are worried that it would teeter on the line of \"man-hating\" but I am here to dispel those rumors and let you all know that it is nothing like that! The movie does not focus on trivial ideals such as \"hating men\" and instead choses to focus on Harley Quinn and how she struggles to move on post Joker. To be perfectly candid, after coming out of the movie I felt so invigorated and powerful. It's always amazing to see strong and powerful women on the big screen and director Cathy Yan should be proud of this movie.\n",

We went to watch this movie and we were so bored we just wanted it to end already. First of all, the movie is made for teenage girls and it's all about woman power and beating up men during super loud music making it a complete chick flick. Men are portrayed as such a**holes all the time it gets boring fast. Harley is a badass we get it, but seeing endless waves of men double her size get destroyed so easily, is so unreal it hurts. The movie tries to be serious with some graphic scenes and then it all breaks down when you see ridiculous fights and Harley acting more like an adult who likes to to talk and act like a baby than the Harley we know from comics and games, something a kid would most likely enjoy and not an adult. And there's this misbalance going on about the tone this movie is setting. It's like they added all the ideas of the writers to keep everyone happy and created this mess. Harley is trying to convince us throughout the movie how bad she is as a person without actually being bad or doing anything remotely bad compared to the other villain. The maximum you get is her being mean. It doesn't feel like she is a villain by the way she is acting, but a caring person. Many lines are so cheesy that will make you shake your head. There is a scene which completely loses touch with reality and will make you say \"ok so anything goes in this movie then, got it\" or say \"oh come on!\". If you are a gamer then you will immediately notice how they copied the game pattern of wave of bad guys empty handed, then wave of bad guys with melee weapons then wave of bad guys with guns and then the boss.

      "Document: The worst movie in the DCEU This feels like the most cliche movie you've ever seen. The overused \"you probably wanna know how we got here\" narration by harley quinn turns this movie in to an unfunny comedy. The biggest issue with the movie however is black mask. I like Ewan Mcgregor but this is the worst casting I've ever seen. Black mask is a dark and cruel character, in this movie he's extremely stupid and he comes off as stubborn and childish. The side characters are also extremely silly and underwhelming. I mean can you even imagime the Ben Affleck Batman in this gotham dealing with these villains. This movie had so much potential, great villain, black canary and a great opportunity to introduce new heroes. Instead this definitely under budget comedy of a movie seals the grave on the DCEU and won't be remembered because barely anyone watched it. This movie could've been so much better. Warner Brothers needs to commit to a tone because this movie single-handedly destroyed the perception of Gotham the most important city in the DCEU.\n",

It delivered the \"Jackie Chan\" style action we wanted. The action scenes are amazing and some of the stunts Margot does in this film is incredible. Ewan (and his minion) is equally amazing, at first I didn't recognize him as I remember him best from Moulin Rouge. He has a very scary character that he portrays extremely well. If you are female you may relate to what Harley goes through after she breaks up with her boyfriend. Both the women and men suffer in different ways.

It's not the same for me to say that I want to be like superman or batman cause they have their own style and they are men and even If i try to imitate them, we have very little in common but when I get to see movies like this where women are the stars is just WOW. I feel super connected with them because they're not only superheroes or villains but they are girls that get dirty and fight and not the common stuff of a delicate girl or whatever stereotypes are for us. Idk.. I just love to feel like I, as a woman, can be super powerful as well. for good or for evil but I can get dirty and grotesque and fight as well. 10/10 I loved every single moment of it, although is not really the best movie in cinema aspects, it's a superhero movie after all and I feel like it should be seen as that and don't care much about if what you see is \"stupid\" or \"dramatic\" cause that's the point.\n",

      "Document: A fun, although slightly unoriginal, blast With some great, all out performances, and a sheer sense of fun energy; Birds of Prey makes for an entertaining comic book film that may not be totally original, but is certainly different from the rest. The film's script can be a bit average at times, containing plot points you have certainly seen before, however, where Birds of Prey shines most is its unique sense of storytelling and the ridiculously entertaining things it does with it. Margot Robbie give a 'fabulous' performance as Harley Quinn, removing all my doubts of her playing the famous character after Suicide Squad. The other women in the film also give some great performances, with the greatest stand out being Mary Elizabeth Winstead who steals every ounce of her screen time, bringing her A-game as always. Ewan McGregor also gives a fun filled performance as the film's titular villain Black Mask. The film is filled with absolutely awesome action sequences that are bound to at least put a grin on your face, and if that doesn't, then the large dose of well-timed humor will certainly do the trick. In the end, Birds of Prey isn't the best DC has had to offer, but it is certainly a blast, and certainly an experience unlike any other. My Rating: 9.25/10\n",

If your reading this in 2030 you might be suprised to learn that as I write this updated review 8/20 the rating is a 6 . If you are wondering how this could have happened , I believe it's because of the expectations that movie Joker placed on the direction of the story telling. It may have been a a tough act to follow for anyone. Sure, I wasn't expecting much but the opening credits nodded to what was to come and I appreciate so many aspects of how this was done. And there is Roller-skate fighting! This qualifies everything I have stated lol I wasn't sure I was in for a zany Harley Quinn ride. I didn't even know what I wanted, Soon I was won over and for the price of a movie ticket I was thoroughly entertained ! Update I recently caught this on television, it translates beautifully! Maybe it was meant for the longevity of the small big screen. No spoilers, I get that, I personally avoid previews to movies I plan to see. Ps when will IMDB have some basic standards? I thought this was an extension of the file review books we relied on prior. How can one give a 1 to a movie of such high production ? This is what is most dislike about this site.

      "Birds of Prey is an awesome superhero film focusing its story line of Harley Quinn and her coming across other female vigilante's like Black Canary, Huntress, and Renee Montoya. Birds of Prey is like the DCs version of Deadpool. It is fun, it breaks the ground barrier of fourth wall narration from Harley's storytelling, and the action is bloody fun. I did not have any expectations with this movie cause of its poor marketing with the trailers. Making the movie seem boring and annoying with Harley Quinn personality. After watching, I was surprised and I loved it.\n",

The film is narrated by Harley Quinn as she explains certain backstories like Huntress or Renee Montoya. And certain events which all leads up to them meeting up. It is a lot of fun with its narrative structure. Harley (Margot Robbie) is torn up about the break up from Joker. But now many bad guys are after her cause Joker is no longer protecting her. Meanwhile, Cassandra (Ella Jay Basco) pickpockets one of Roman/Black Mask (Ewan McGregor) henchman and stole a diamond that is worth a lot to him. Roman decides to put a bounty on Cassandra which Harley tries to protect her from. Which Renee (Rosie Perez), Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and Dinah/ Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) try to help her as well.\n",

Which she handled scenes very well and did great with the action sequences. The action and fight sequences are entertaining and exciting. There are some gory scenes with Black Mask henchman skinning a guys face off. Got to remember it is an R rated film. Every fight scene is thrilling and worth watching. The climax taking place in a closed down theme park. Really felt like one awesome carnival ride with watching Harley, Dinah, Renee, and Huntress team up. Which kind of sucks cause they only team up in the climax of the movie. And you kind of want more.\n",

The movie is a wild ride. I'll start out with that. This is 100% not for children, so be advised. Harley is the main character and I feel like this is as close to a solo film as we are going to get. Margot Robbie is better than ever as Harley Quinn. Her comedic timing is perfect and her action scenes are bone crunchingly bad ass! I am a huge fan of Huntress and have been for a long time. I also love Mary Elizabeth Winstead so I knew the character would be done right and it was. Renée Montoya is a wonderful character played by Rosie Perez. Renée is the oldest of the girls and she plays it with ease and with a sense of street smarts as well. She also has a mean punch. Black Canary is played by Jurnee Smollett-Bell and is a runaway stand out. She is sassy and can kick the crap out of anyone. The Black Canary also has the power of sonic scream and that is awesome to see on screen. The girls are best when they are together hands down. The fight scenes are part John wick and part deadpool in the best ways possible. I really loved the fight scenes. They were surprisingly violent. Ewan McGregor was amazing as Black Mask! Needless to say I want to see more of these characters in the future. Fingers crossed that this gets a few sequels.\n",

All men are either useless, stupid, misogynistic, evil or some combination of all. And the hero of this film is a narcissistic, violent, psychopath who loves egg sandwiches, isn't that cute, funny quirky and irreverent, laugh! You non-progressive oppressor. Btw, in what way was she emancipated? She had no restrictions on her behavior at any point, she makes no growth as a character, the one thing she does get over is her breakup with the Joker, but we never see him or the dynamic of their relationship, no codependency, abuse, nothing hinted at that she suffered from and then later overcame through the course of the movie. Leaving all of the subtext and messaging aside, the movie on its own merit isn't good. The villain couldn't be any weaker and more forgettable, the characters are paper thin because there are too many of them to flesh out and the whole poop out the diamond storyline, what is this a 1980s TV show? It's uninspired, unimaginative and dated. I can't think of one memorable scene in this movie I liked and no I can't get into fight scenes in which 200lb stuntmen fly around trying not to accidently hurt 120lb women in heels, makeup and wigs. How are they able to break bones or knock them out with one blow? There's no context in terms of rigorous training or super strength or agility. No, they're kicking their butts with feminism and if you don't like it you must hate women. Good luck with that marketing and trying shame people into liking your movie WBs, because it worked so well with Ghostbusters. It may sound like I didn't enjoy this film, but if it had a little bit more narration it might have swayed me, there were 2mins or so of screen time in which there wasn't any narration either telling me what I was about to see with my own eyes or trying to fill in holes in the swiss cheese storyline in postproduction. At least Suicide Squad was just a bad movie, this is a bad movie that makes you feel like Alex in a Clockwork Orange. You'd better watch and see what a terrible person you are for having a penis and if you don't I'll tell the world it's because you're scared of empowered vaginas. I wonder how all of the people that made, support or just enjoyed this film would feel about it if all of the gender roles were switched and if the answer is, they've already seen Hollywood make those films, then I hope they have enough self-awareness to then understand how I felt watching this.\n",

It's filled with funny parts, which I loved. -- Awesome! & Acrobatic scenes from the movie the parts of the movie was really funny tho, because the joker broke up with her and she was depressed, she hung up his picture and threw knives at it, she joined an underground skating ring sport so she could beat up people to get her stress out. Also some guys tried to take advantage of her by getting her drunk first. It just reminded me a lot of how people are to girls. Idk, it's just a lot of funny scenes from the movie that this video doesn't show, but you can see some of the fighting scenes atleast here. There was one villain in the movie who was very sadistic, and he would peel people's face off with a knife. He was pretty freaky I liked how he died in the movie. They made him have a really good death scene. But before they did they showed how evil he was, he scarred his chest for each woman he would kill. Etc. The Death scene assigned to him was very fitting for him. Some of the movie is goofy, but most of it was good and funny tho. I don't mind the goofy scenes, since it kinda fitted in with her make-believe style super hero character. She had a pet Hyena, and she named it \"Bruce Wayne\" after Batman. I thought that part was funny as well. Most modern movies, I haven't really liked the fight choregraphy, but this one reminded me a lot of 90s movies. It's not super super realistic, but lots of twirling of weapons and the flashy moves/weapon tosses made it entertaining to watch. Reminded me of stick twirling when she got her Base-ball Bat in the movie. It was funny she had a Hyena named \"Bruce Wayne\" Which is actually Batman's name, so that's an easter egg for the fans of the batman universe etc. Since she named it after her enemies etc. Me & My Friend enjoyed the movie as well, and thought parts of it was funny. He rated 4/5, I rated 5/5 although there were a few scenes that was boring, which almost made me rate it 4/5, but I liked the character/ the movie a lot so I'll plan to get it when it comes out on DVD l8ter..\n",

Margot Robie is pretty so there are points there, but theres not much worse than the stereotype NY accent. The story is a joke too....they don't take anything seriously.

Harley quinn herself is well adapted, same happens with black canary (What really surprised me), but all the other characters seem wrong. Why?, well Cassandra cain is a the big answer to that, they made a dark and mute assasin become a random problematic kid that ends up loving harley. Black mask is just a random villain that cant decide if he is just a gay mad villain or a mafia boss, because it seems that he cant be both at the same time. Zsas is just a minion and has 0 development, he is there just to fill a space. Finally Huntress, god i hated how they made Huntress, i love the actress but im sure this character wasnt for her and at the same time the script sucks, all the things huntress says in the movie are completly irrelevant and even her story feels kind of weak.\n",

At the same time, the style is never clear, as probably most of the things in the movie, it never defines if it wants to be acomedy like deadpool or a serious story, or a parody, or if it wants to be suicide squad 2 (By literally copying the visuals of it)\n",

I see a lot of people criticize this movie's choice to tell it's story. The film jumps around as it gives you information for the scene your about to see. I personally loved this choice because it really put you in the mind of Harley Quinn. I loved when the film freeze framed and would show chaotic vandalism-like drawing over the frame (presumably written by Harley). It just helps put you in her mind. Also this direction of story telling was also in Deadpool and people praised that film (because it's amazing) and didn't even bring up how it told it's story in such a chaotic way. Honestly, the chaotic story telling works better with the character of Harley Quinn anyways because she's a psychopath. I love Deadpool, I think it's absolutely incredible I just don't think it's fair to hate on BOP for it but turn the other way when it comes to Deadpool\n",

Every male figure in this movie has been highlighted in a bad way, even down to the poor egg sandwich maker who only ever purchases out of date cheese! Seems like the use of a movie to ostracise men. It would have been nice to have had at least one good male hero / icon in this movie to give the message that the whole population of men are not all terrible. In this day and age equality is paramount. I am a women and I did not once feel empowered by this movie - no high fives, no cheering were to be had. The 'fight' scenes are reminiscent of 1990s version Power Rangers, you could actually see where the actors were moving out of the way and not being hit. Even though this movie is clearly on a feminist tangent, it's quite strange that the female director contradicts this message by repeatedly explaining the back story of Harley Quinn, therefore patronising every women by automatically presuming that they would not know or have even read the comics!

They chose to keep a lot of the same elements (most of which were the ones highly enjoyed in SS) and elevate them and turn them into this crazy carnival ride, where Harley Quinn will find herself and gather a team next to her. And despite many people's worries, I think the movie does a great job of seperating the Birds of Prey from Harley. Make no mistake, this is obviously a Harley Quinn movie. But by the end, you'll see just how she managed to make something that will be able to stand on its own which is just amazing. Let's face it, that just wouldn't have happened on the big screeen in the next ten years without the help from the iconic Harley Quinn (movie) character. They could totally do a spin-off alone with the Birds now - or maybe still keep Harley in a smaller role (Gotham City Sirens leading up to?).\n",

      "In the end, I think the movie succeeded in exactly what it wanted to be. It wanted to be a trip. It wanted to be a Harley Quinn origin story. It wanted to be a Birds of Prey origin story. It wanted to be a story about finding yourself after losing your identity (relationship, job, safety, vengeance road). Incorporating all of that means chaos...but that is the point of this Harley Quinn's character exactly. The movie is through her mind. And you just have to stick along and enjoy the chaos unfold in a delightful and sharp manner and explosion of colors... and other stuff.\n",

Honestly, people, just because this is a movie and it's given a big budget, it's still just a singular version of the character(s). Like in any other platform. Why should it try to copy (which, it still does borrow a lot and pay homage several places)? You wouldn't say that if this was a new comic book series with Harley and the Birds of Prey, would you now. Anywhere you start new, you start new. You don't just copy. (*cough cough* Lion King remake *cough* I mean live action version.) Enjoy every version for themselves please, I'm sure they all have good sides and bad sides you can take something from, and the approach here is clearly working for what DC has been wanting to do with their cinematic universe. Which IMO we all are being way too hard on. You don't see the same kinda pressure with the often formularic Marvel movies (with all the respect to them and what they are trying to do), so it should only be fair to show some respect and mercy where more creativity and risks are the things being prioritized. Right? This is just one version, not more and not less credit to it than any other version - just more people will probably see it because it's the mainstream one. And this cinemac universe will keep expanding in all layers. Remember to have fun. The movie is very inviting of that.\n",

      "Document: Disappointing I really did not enjoy this movie and I wanted to so bad. However, it was dragged on a little too long, characters were not fully developed and the parts that were supposed to be funny fell flat. I also thought the young asian girl (being asian myself and love seeing asian representation, I don't say this lightly) was just not skilled enough in acting yet to hold her own in this movie. Most of the scenes with her didn't feel realistic enough and reminded me that I was watching a movie rather then helping me get immersed in the story with believable acting. I think in time she would be a great actress. A lot of scenes where Margot Robbie would talk directly to the audience gave me Deadpool vibes, but did not come close to the humor. By the end, I was waiting for the movie to be over. DC movies continue to disappoint me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, this has no impact on the actual movie, but can we talk about how Ewan McGregor and the actress who plays huntress met on another set and he basically left his wife of 20 years for her. Didn't sit well with me seeing them both in this movie, but that's just my own personal opinion. I personally avoid watching certain actors if I don't agree with their life choices, but of course that doesn't go for everyone.\n",

Honestly it is one of the \"superheroes\" movies that I have seen to date, the only problem I see in the movie is that it does not look so much like comics, but personally I prefer an original adaptation to a comic book. Please, stop believing all the negative comments about the movie, there are always haters trying to discredit good movies for the simple fact that it was not what they wanted. The movie has nothing feminist, inclusion or anything (I don't see the problem if I had it). Watch it, enjoy it and judge it for yourselves ^. ^\n",

Anyway I can't stand watching a film, which by design as I have understood is about equality and empowerment of women, use the most stereotypical of feminine traits to portray them as badass and effective in a cruel world. This is the result of trying to make a b role from a character that was stereotypicaly created at its time as a second fiddle. Stop the madness!!!! Create new movies with new concerts of strong women leads to enhance equality! Apart from that, the movie was lacking of logic, I know it's a film and you are not supposed to find absolute logic but this is beyond 'stupid film' logic.\n",

They entire film summarized \"men are perverts and women are all powerful\". Don't take this as women are worse than men or they don't deserve equality or respect or something like that at all I believe they deserve all of those things, but this movie literally has no redeeming men at all, every guy is a perv and makes you want to punch them in the face, it drops the movie down because no one enjoys so many scenes that make you grossed and pissed at every dude in the movie. There are so so many underlying messages and lines about feminism and whatnot, which is not bad in real life OK, but dang it I just want a good dc movie about comics and super hero's. Also the girls only team up for like 2 minutes so there is not unified team that you root for in a movie just a ton of side plots and individual story lines that leave you wanting more.

Paradise Hills and Birds of Prey have things in common. They both came out this year, and they are both male hating feminist crap. It took a long time for me to find a worse performance by a woman in a comic book movie then Alice Silverstone in Batman and Robin, but Margot Robbie ( Harley Quinn and ( especially) Rosie Perez ( Renee Montoya) were that bad. They made Silverstone's Batgirl seem like Christian Bale's Batman. A special hate is for the fight scenes, which made the Batman TV show which was not to be taken seriously, seem like the Dark Knight Trilogy.. I cannot believe all of the high grades this film is getting on IMDB. Those people must be well HIGH on something, because they have had a fantasy that this film was good. Now maybe, I am the wrong demographic for Birds of Prey: Male, straight, conservative and over the age of five, so it is to be expected, I would not find it the least bit entertaining, but I just do not get the love ( although not to the degree that Phoenix winning the Best Actor Oscar for Joker did). The Best thing about Birds of Prey? It did not get me angry like Paradise Hills and Joker did. Since IMDB does not allow her zero stars. I have to give it one star above. But in reality it is a horrible movie an easy zero stars.\n",

The jokes were middle school level, but in an R-rated movie, and why R-rated? So they could curse. Unnecessary. I didn't expect much from this girl powe extravaganza, but wow was it bad. This is the first movie I can remember watching that made me angrier and angrier as I watched it. It's like Deadpool if your only experience with Deadpool was having it described to you by your 12 year old nephew, and with a girl as the lead. Nothing against women action heroes, but damn this was bad. Not one character that wasn't super annoying. How does a company make Suicide Squad, and then learn nothing and throw a 100+ million dollars at this. I could have watched a Nicolas Cage VOD movie and found more entertainment. By the way, normally I am sympathetic to filmmakers based on budget and resources, bu Warner Brothers has the money and ability to hire top notch talent and this is what they did instead.\n",

Harley is fun and the story concise, I particularly love Huntress and how she is simoultaniously a cold blooded killer but is unabel to comunicate her chosen name accuratly to the world which results in her being called with complelty different one. It also portrays a more human Harley and starts showing hints of being a deeper character. FInally I loved the relationship between Harley and Cassandra Cain reminding me of two sisters. This movie doesn't take itself too seriously, has comedy that works and is over all a fun ride.\n",

Don't go in looking for any deep messages. It's more upbeat, with a few serious scenes that really establish the threat.

Our girl as a bonafide psychologist. I remember how she talked down the fire eating Diablo of Suicide Squad in the trailer - no alcohol for you. And it's a great asset in bat crazy Gotham. I saw the film opening day, before the name change, and I didn't know the DC Birds of Prey so think switching the name around is the right move. It's Margot Robbie's movie.

But when Joker dumped our girl she took matters into her own hand and blew up the very spot where they had once celebrated said love. Take that Joker, and don't acid rain on Harley's parade!

But what if the bad boys of Gotham found out Harley is flying solo now? Chief among them being Ewan McGregor's Roman Sionis, a big Gotham crime lord. And it's a wild ride of a story with his nom de plume Black Mask. I'm not sure where the name came from (DC history and all that) but Roman likes his African antiquities.\n",

But Monoya is already chasing a killer who just took out a crew with a crossbow. Execution style. Someone really didn't like those bad boys. Turns out Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress has a ton of history with Gotham. Her real name is Helena Bertinelli, and her family were slain in an eye popping display of blood when she was a child. She understandably wants those involved dead. And Jurnee Smollett-Bell is Dinah Lance, the Black Canary with the killer voice who sings for her supper at Roman's club.

And it's a wrestlemania with choreographed mayhem. And maybe just maybe they can blow the whole Kerpow style comic book of psychopaths to their mutual, and a tasty egg and bacon sandwich, with cheese, satisfaction.\n",

SS was an enormous mess even its star power, but that's a whole other review to be made about its script, its pacing, its tone, its editing, everything. Birds of Prey in contrast was vibrant and refreshing, with a lot of momentum despite a less star-studded cast. One of the most solid DC movies in recent years. With less of a gimmicky feel in its self awareness, BoP didn't take itself too seriously the way SS did (which ended up stifling a lot of its characters' potential), so it felt miles more authentic. It's hard to make anything truly novel and un-cliche in this current era of reboots and sequels, but BoP kept me engaged and wishing for more beyond the end credits. Unfortunate that it didn't get the marketing it deserved and instead was brought down by anti-feminists afraid of more than one or two women in a superhero movie. Even more unfortunate that there's rumors about replacing the side characters and little possibility of a sequel because of the marketing \"flop.\" It's a good movie, well worth the watch, and pretty unfairly evaluated as a ploy or pushing an agenda when it's just women characters written and directed by women.

      "Document: not for men It's REALLY not surprising to me that everyone giving this a poor rating is a man. it makes sense because this movie wasn't made for men. it's a classic DC antihero thriller, but the twist is that the target audience is young women. everything from the details like how she paints her guns or the graffiti on the street, the costumes and makeup and jewelry, the jokes, the different fighting styles of each character, the colors used to light the scenes, even the soundtrack: it's all by women, for women. think of a romcom of a woman post breakup, add in a little gore and choreographed fighting scenes, have her \"find herself\" by killing a TON OF MEN, and you have this movie. it's definitely not for everyone, and i can see why it's getting a couple of the negative reviews (like how she is suddenly not very crazy anymore but instead very coherent and driven), but imagine if Iron Man had a target audience of 24 year old women. y'all probably wouldn't have liked that as much either.\n",

      "Document: Fun and filled to the brim with personality From Margot's performance, to the visuals, to the fight scenes and to the soundtrack, this movie is such an enjoyable experience. You can tell how much Margot loves this character and how much effort she went through to do her character justice. She's the perfect Harley and nails the personality traits that made her original character from the Batman animated series special, which was lost to most of her other adaptations where they made her into an oversexualized yandere stereotype. And I think the two brief emotional moments where she tears up were very effective at making the audience feel for Harley. I also adore her voice and her Harley laugh. This movie is also visually and musically stunning. I adore how colorful everything is while still mantaining its aesthetic. The fight scenes are so engaging and well coreographed, I genuinely enjoyed watching Harley move. Of course theyre not perfect given that in some moments that thing where the bad guys kind of stand still and wait their turn while the protagonists is beating another bad guy instead of everyone attacking the protagonist at once happened but then again i dont think ive ever seen a fight scene that involved one character vs multiple ones that DIDNT do that, so im not gonna hold it against it. The original soundtrack is also a delight, my personal favorites are Diamonds, Experiment on me, Sway with me and Doja Cat's song (even though it was only in it for a split second). I think the only valid criticism I've seen towards this movie that isnt just whiny misogynsitic triggered males going \"wahh wamen bad, im opressed because a woman made a movie starring women!! reverse sexism is real😢 gender politics!!😫\" is that this is very much a Harley-centric movie and theres not much about the actual Birds of Prey in it. I respect and agree with Margot's decision of making Harley interact with other characters and making it a fun girl gang movie, but I think it would've been a much better choice to make Harley's sidekicks Catwoman and Poison Ivy and naming it Gotham City Sirens. Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie where Margot shines as Harley more than ever. The humor is great and its one of those movies where you get to watch a quirky character get herself in and out of trouble while seeing the world through her eyes. Both Cathy Yan and Margot did an amazing job and I hope the progress this movie did with its portrayal of Harley doesnt get completely set back with the upcoming Suicide Squad reboot.\n",

Harley acts as the narrator and tells us the story, sometimes going back. There are a few funny dialogs and scenes. We see a development of character as Harley is single now and must learn to be on her own. The Birds of Prey, Harley and Cass are a strong, diverse group of women. There is a lot of diversity in the whole movie. The fact that it was written and directed by women also made me curious. Margot Robbie as Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn is especially incredible if you consider that she's Australian playing a crazy psychiatrist with a thick American accent. Ewan McGregor was convincing as a bad guy, especially in one scene. Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress, Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary, Rosie Perez as Montoya, Chris Messina as Zsasz, Ella Jay Basco as Cass were also good. The music helped frame the shots as well. Go check out the movie yourself.\n",

All the Harlequin toys and props are there in the film, awesome and funny seeing them actually being used like the baseball bat, hammer and all the rest. As for the Birds of Prey, yes, these were disappointing and this was the only let down in my opinion, but it's a starter movie, it's how she became independent of Joker, I'd expect a sequel to use them more and introduce them in a deeper way.

I'm a huge marvel and dc geek so I judge heavily to a degree on superhero films. I'll say this off the bat; if you go into this film expecting anything other than a silly and action packed romp then you will be utterly disappointed. The story is a sequel of sorts to Suicide Squad after she breaks up with the Joker, and her trying to survive against Black Mask. Margot Robbie plays Harley Quinn superbly; even better than Suicide Squad I'd wager. The acting besides her was decent. Ewan McGregor played Black Mask to the best of the script which was still the strongest DCEU villain to date. Black Canary and Cassandra Cain were equally cool. I personally didn't like the cop Montoya or Huntress who played an overly goth child with rage issues and reminded me of a poor attempt at Sigourney Weaver; Zsasz also was blah to me compared to the Zsasz in Gotham. The humor was rampant and relentless; had me laughing at numerous spots. The action was constant and had some cringe worthy scenes for some who don't have the strongest stomaches. Go and see it for Bruce the hyena. I rated it a 10 for pure entertainment gold. A realistic 8/9 would be more so since I thought the two aforementioned female characters dampened it; regardless this is a movie you don't wanna miss...\n",

      "Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn is a fantastic film. Director Cathy Yan has finally given us an anti-hero movie we deserve, after the slightly disappointing Suicide Squad(2016). Harley Quinn who is undoubtedly the best part of the 2016 super villain team-up film, is front & center this time around. The R-rating definitely helps. Now, there are no compromises made to the action set pieces. The action set pieces are jaw-dropping. The comedic scenes will leave you guffawing. The visual effects are flawless. The prologue is unique & hilarious. Margot Robbie is the star of the show, as Harley Quinn. Robbie portrays various emotions with ease & grace & definitely deserves to be one of the key players of the DC Extended Universe, going forward. Rosie Perez is great as Renee Montoya. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is brilliant as Helena Bertinelli/The Huntress. Jurnee Smollett-Bell is outstanding as Dinah Lance/Black Canary. Ewan McGregor is having the time of his life, as the deplorable yet deliciously evil, Roman Sionis. Ella Jay Basco is amazing as Cassandra Cain. Chris Messina is superb as Victor Zsasz. Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn is a must watch for fans of Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. Go, have an absolute whale of a time!
